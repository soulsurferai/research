              "quote": "Ishana Night delivers a delectable fairy tale rooted in folklore and steeped in mystery, masterfully telling a story that has you leaning in, wanting to know more with every vivid frame that flickers on screen. Essentially a low-budget premise but with a high concept and stakes to match, The Watchers (or The Watched if you're in the UK) is a compelling character study of what makes us who we are. Everyone wears masks but it's the reasons we choose the masks we hide behind that reveal who we truly are....",
