She is soft spoken and serene, a lovely woman. Only gradually do we see how deep rooted is her need to understand God in her own way and how convinced she is that she's doing it absolutely the right way. Movies never, ever take a certain type of religious conversion all the way to such a logical conclusion....",

They are supposed to be real not inside the main character's head. Look at the way they are depicted, she is in a police station, and the people around her react to these things, another woman prisoner begins singing \"hark the herald angel\", the bars fall magically off the cell doors, the TV that is on starts showing the 4 horsemen and angelic figures, and we hear the sound of the trumpet and see everyone: the sheriffs, the prisoners reacting to this....",

Mimi Rogers turns in a stunning performance as a woman trapped in a cycle of dull work and duller play, whose life is transformed twice -- first by a religious conversion, and then by coming face to face with the literal meaning of that conversion. She is incandescent in her belief, and in the movie's final scenes, takes on the epic proportions of a Job or King Lear....",

Those rare instances where it is, it is usually handled in a dogmatic way, either to promote a particular brand of religion (i.e. the Billy Graham evangelistic movies or Mel Gibson's brutal Passion of the Christ) or sometimes to ridicule or parody it (The Life of Brian, But I'm a Cheerleader!, or more recently, Saved!) Michael Tolkin's complex, enigmatic story takes it seriously; but at the same time, raises important and intelligent questions that every person who has seriously considered or questioned their religious belief must at one point or another examine......",
