# Folk Horror (work files)

This folder contains the working artifacts behind the *Folk Horror* analysis/report.

## Contents

- `Data/` — extracted / assembled datasets used for analysis
- `insights/` — derived JSON insight outputs (per-film + combined)
- `scripts/` — notebooks + scripts used to generate insights and reports

## Notes

- This is an initial lift-and-shift of the existing local folder structure (not yet normalized into a shared repo convention).
- Large / unrelated artifacts were intentionally excluded (e.g., `ml-100k*`, zip archives).
