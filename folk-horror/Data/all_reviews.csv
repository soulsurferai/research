imdb_the_rapture_boba_fett1138_20111003,The Rapture,IMDb,Boba_Fett1138,2011-10-03,7,Has its originality going for it.,"It's hard to form an opinion about this movie really, since it's hard to say what the movie is actually trying to achieve and say. This also means that the movie is quite an unique one really, which is something that still makes this movie interesting and a good watch. Thing I'm still confused about is if it was supposed to be Christian propaganda or one that criticizes and openly questions it. That movie does both things really, which also does make the movie more or less unpredictable, which is however also a positive thing though of course. Perhaps this was also exactly what the film-makers were aiming for; confuse its viewers so that they can openly question and think about things and get into discussions with each other. Seems to me that everybody will interpret this movie in their own way and both Christians and atheists can both get plenty out of this movie. So really no matter how you feel about this movie, you'll still get intrigued by it. This is a great power that this movie has and the foremost reason why I actually ultimately ended up liking it, even though I didn't always understood what was going on exactly. This is a bit of a problem with the movie. It gets a quite messy one at times and due to its storytelling, we have to take a lot of things for granted. Not everything feels- and flows naturally, which doesn't always make this the most believable movie. But perhaps it feels a bit off and odd just because the movie is taking such an original approach and features an unique concept in it. Because of that it is hard to compare this to anything we know and are familiar with. It's just a one of a kind movie that you should also take that way. Don't think too much about its storytelling or acting, just focus on its themes instead and you'll see that this is a quite good and intriguing movie. Christian or atheist; the movie doesn't really pick 'sides' with anyone and everyone will get something different out of this movie. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",359,10,1,False

imdb_the_rapture_taketworeviews_20230209,The Rapture,IMDb,TakeTwoReviews,2023-02-09,7,Kermode. Not wrong.,"I'm here because Mark Kermode told me to watch this. I hope he's right, the poster looks a bit racy. There's an instant dark tone. Okay it's called The Rapture, but we open on an oppressive call centre scene, like something from a Cronenberg nightmare. People trapped in cubicles, muttering to themselves. One such mutterer is Sharon (Mimi Rogers) who along with Vic (Patrick Bauchau), likes to cruise the local LA bars and pick up people like Randy (David Duchovny). It's fair to say Sharon, is bored, unfulfilled. Despite jumping into bed with Randy, who's, well, randy. ""Everything just seems so empty"". Until she comes across some Jesus types, who talk about a coming prophet and she starts hearing about the dream. A collective vision that some more Jesus type coworkers whisper about around the water cooler. It's got that weird almost Lynchian 90s vibe. Everything a little soulless. Sparse. Bathed in an orange hue. Sharon decides she's had enough trying to find meaning in meaningless sex. She wants to find God and be saved. Randy is not convinced and Sharon finds the readjustment something of a challenge, but she does have an experience and becomes something of an evangelist. Telling people calling directory enquires that they need to be ready for God returning. It's very mysterious, especially as things get a little culty in Sharon's new circles. Soon those new circles are older as we're told it's 6 years later and Sharon together with Randy have a child, named Mary of course. They all believe the rapture is imminent. That there's a purpose, a meaning, but things get confusing for Sharon when a disgruntled working goes nuts with a shotgun in Randy's office. ""Life is some kind of punishment isn't it"". Rogers plays this well. She's creepy and convincing. Mary (Kimberly Cullum) too as, left alone, they camp out in the desert... waiting. It takes a little time to really dig in and you need an open mind, but this is really good. Kermode. Not wrong.",337,4,0,False
imdb_the_rapture_christhecat_20070518,The Rapture,IMDb,christhecat,2007-05-18,6,"Is this REALLY a ""pro-Christian"" film?","I saw this when it came out in 1991, and again recently, and it amazes me how many people see this as a purely pro-Christian film. I've always thought it was as much an indictment of fundamentalist Christianity, as ""pro-Christian."" Consider this: if it is such a pro-Christian film, why does the protagonist unapologetically refute Christianity at the end? And ask yourself: will this film really convert any non-believers? (Mimi Rogers' character begins the film empty inside, and ends the film just as empty-- that will hardly convince anyone who is looking for answers.) The Rapture presents a simplified version of the millennial view that fundamentalist Christians believe and so fundamentalists see it as pro-Christian. Conversely, if you come to this film as an atheist or agnostic you will get all the bitter distaste religion already gives you in spades. I suspect anyone with a purely open mind (including non-fundamentalist Christians) will come away confused, and ponder the film for some time (indeed, that's how I felt the first time I saw it). This film was the first to give me the notion that fundamentalist Christians have essentially given up on this world, and can't wait for The Rapture: Mimi and her co-believers have a bunker mentality, they gather together, listen to the young prophet, perhaps try to convert others, and are filled with joy that the world is coming to an end (are their lives that empty that they can't wait for the world to end?) I was reminded of this again recently (in 2006) when Israel attacked Hezbollah in Lebanon, and hundreds of posts appeared on Christian message boards from Christians who ""felt like dancing"" because they thought it was the beginning of the end. Such a small view of God. I would think God was infinite, and thus the universe were infinite, rather than revolving around one tiny planet, with everything predetermined, and the end coming like a carefully crafted stage-play, with the true believers cowering before the Lord, praying that their sinful neighbors all go to Hell.",341,15,6,True
imdb_the_rapture_mombasa_pete_20061224,The Rapture,IMDb,mombasa_pete,2006-12-24,10,You people need to understand this film better.,"The final scenes which show the end of the world and the apocalypse and the passing of all the biblical prophecies (the four horsemen, the trumpets etc) are NOT hallucinatory. They are supposed to be real not inside the main character's head. Look at the way they are depicted, she is in a police station, and the people around her react to these things, another woman prisoner begins singing ""hark the herald angel"", the bars fall magically off the cell doors, the TV that is on starts showing the 4 horsemen and angelic figures, and we hear the sound of the trumpet and see everyone: the sheriffs, the prisoners reacting to this. The point of the film is this: that religious fanaticism may be frightening. But what would be EVEN MORE frightening: what if the religious zealots depicted in the film, what if they turned out not to be misguided or wrong in their beliefs but to be RIGHT: that the Book of Revelations actually WILL come true! This is what makes the film so terrifying. The very final scene where the 2 remaining characters, Will Patton and Mimi Rogers are in Heaven, shows that in the end even though the world has ended and the coming of the Apocalypse has passed, and the Second Reign of Heaven has come, that in the end, the Mimi Rogers character finally realizes that in spite of her previous choices, that she decides human free will and the right to question, to choose (i.e. free speech) must be paramount, EVEN if this means she is condemned to purgatory forever. So she chooses NOT to embrace God, this is why Will Patton suddenly vanishes, he chooses to and goes to Heaven, but she allows her earlier doubts, about how God can allow evil and suffering, to prevent her from accepting God as the Saviour. She accepts He exists, but will not follow Him. So THIS is the film's ultimate message: that human freewill may triumph even against the strongest powers. I know this may be hard to accept, but it does not make the film anti-Christian but thought provoking. I am Catholic and was not offended by the film at all, as it raises important issues. What is sad is that it is clear from previous comments on this site is that it went straight over many people's heads. Read more, attend more University courses, is my advice.",404,51,9,True
imdb_the_rapture_lukecustomer2_20210528,The Rapture,IMDb,LukeCustomer2,2021-05-28,7,This movie did (and does) make me think,"First, this movie is very sexually graphic so don't watch it with mom or dad or the kids. But I think it speaks to the idea of the loss and confusion of humanity. Sharon is representative of most human beings. A boring job, a boring life, searching for meaning.. possibly with sex and then with religion (ironic that Rogers was a scientologist). It is just something to help you get through this life. What got me about this script is the moving ending. After being disappointed so many times in life, in god, Sharon would rather be in purgatory for eternity than say she loves god. Isn't that the human way? Stubborn and self destructive. But i have to admit if had been in Sharon's place I might have had the exactly same decision. I also enjoy that they actually try to do the Rapture.. in a vey serious and haunting way. The final minutes of this movie I think will always remember.",163,6,1,False
imdb_the_rapture_david.richmond_20010211,The Rapture,IMDb,david.richmond,2001-02-11,1,Unredeemable,"I think the unintended moral of this film may be, don't blame GOD for making stupid choices based upon erroneous assumptions. Otherwise, The Rapture is so confused in its depiction of Christianity as to render it's ""message"" irrelevent and greatly overpraised. Anyone who thinks this movie somehow makes an ""important"" statement about so-called Christian Fundamentalism has apparently never heard of a straw man argument. These characters are purely fictional creations following the path of a contrived storyline. They espouse a cultish theology that is at best only superficially Christian. I have been a Christian for most of my life and read the Bible completely through several times. What was shown in this film was so far removed from Biblical Christianity that it left me wondering if Tolkin did this intentionally, trying to connect with the average person's hazy familiarity with Biblical prophecy, or was just too lazy to do any research. Regardless, it takes the sting out of any supposed message other than that Mimi Rogers' character needed counseling and should have chosen her spiritual leaders more wisely. I am tempted to recommend that sincere Christians might think about watching this film just to see how we and our beliefs often look to others. I might even recommend viewing it alongside Robert Duvall's film The Apostle for contrast. I can credit Duvall that I felt like I had actually met some of the characters in his film, which is something I cannot say for The Rapture.",246,17,18,False
imdb_the_rapture_kbnewton_20000623,The Rapture,IMDb,kbnewton,2000-06-23,8,Complicated and uncompromising -- possibly Mimi Rogers' finest performance.,"A haunting movie -- one that lingers in the mind (and the heart) for a long time afterwards. Mimi Rogers turns in a stunning performance as a woman trapped in a cycle of dull work and duller play, whose life is transformed twice -- first by a religious conversion, and then by coming face to face with the literal meaning of that conversion. She is incandescent in her belief, and in the movie's final scenes, takes on the epic proportions of a Job or King Lear. You may be puzzled, conflicted, or even offended by what the movie ""means,"" but you won't be able to walk away from it untouched.",110,46,8,False
imdb_the_rapture_ba_harrison_20250111,The Rapture,IMDb,BA_Harrison,2025-01-11,7,Thought-provoking theological themes.,"The Rapture is one of those films that leaves the viewer thinking about the topics raised long after the end credits have rolled. Whatever your opinions on religion, the themes explored in the movie are extremely interesting, writer/director Michael Tolkin inviting discourse about the nature of God, Christianity and the Bible. Mimi Rigers plays Sharon, a telephone operator who spices up her dull life by partaking in the swinging scene with her partner Vic (Patrick Bauchau). It is through these sexual shenanigans that she meets Randy (David Duchovny), with whom she forms a meaningful connection. At the same time, Sharon also discovers God, and decides to turn her life around, leaving the partner swapping behind and settling down with Randy. Six years later, Sharon and Randy have a daughter named Mary, and await the Rapture, which, according to a young prophet in their religious circle, is imminent. After Randy is shot to death by a disgruntled employee, Sharon experiences strange visions that lead her and Mary to the desert where they eagerly await the sound of Gabriel's trumpets that will signal the beginning of the Apocalypse... Will the Rapture actually happen, or are Sharon and Mary mistaken in their beliefs? Although Tolkin ultimately depicts the Rapture as a very real event, his stance on religion remains unclear, the script raising many questions. Why does God demand that we must love him in order for us to ascend to heaven? Are all of our sins absolved if we profess our love for the Almighty? Why must we have faith in something we cannot see? Why does God make us suffer on Earth? What happens to those left behind? Tolkin doesn't provide any answers - his film exists to spark conjecture and discussion. The Rapture is also quite a shocking film, with numerous graphic sex scenes in the first half, the brutal slaughter of several people by the shotgun-toting loony who blasts Randy, and a really disturbing moment in the desert when Sharon's love for Mary and her dedication to God forces her to take extreme action. So not for the whole family, then.",352,2,0,False

It has a lot to say about religion, cults, and the search for meaning in our lives. I definitely don't envy the marketing team who had to try and find a way to advertise this movie to the masses.

Writer-director Michael Tolkin has been both praised and criticized for this portrait of a Born Again Christian; while the movie does contain religious elements, it's not quite Fundamentalist propaganda (neither pro nor con, it stays squarely in the middle, and is sometimes more satire than drama). Much of its overall effect rests on actress Mimi Rogers' shoulders, and her lead performance is nothing short of amazing. Hurt by a limited budget and some sloppy editing which causes confusion at critical points in the story, the film isn't a major success yet it does provide for thoughtful discussion and debate, and it gives Rogers the acting role of her career. **1/2 from ****",142,5,3,False

imdb_the_rapture_huntinpeck80_20230818,The Rapture,IMDb,HuntinPeck80,2023-08-18,7,Low budget movie that takes faith and judgment seriously,"Another review of mine that mysteriously vanished. Should I suspect the presence of the Evil One? Most likely a priggish computer program. But what could I have said that offended the artifically intelligent arbiter of human acceptability? Never mind. Try again. An interesting idea, this movie, with a standout performance by Mimi Rogers (the little girl who plays her daughter impresses also). A bored telephone operator with a lascivious nightlife decides to change her ways when she becomes convinced the end is nigh. Her decisions ultimately lead to tragedy. This was a low budget movie and consequently it can't manage much by way of special effects. I'm sure Roger Ebert, in his review, said that we get to see Heaven. I sure didn't see anything. Ultimately, as with the writer's later film, The New Age, the ending is a tiny bit of a letdown. Rogers' character ends on a note of sullen petulance, nothing to compare with the heroic defiance of a Don Giovanni or a Manfred, or in that movie Quills, the Marquis de Sade. But it's a fine performance up till the final scene, one well worth checking out for anyone wanting to appreciate a formidable adult female taking her destiny in her hands. All the men are side characters in this movie, something that I'm sure will appeal to a certain portion of the viewing public. Early David Duchovny movie.",233,3,1,True
imdb_the_rapture_kinglet_20050208,The Rapture,IMDb,kinglet,2005-02-08,9,The pride of perfect conviction,"Several of the cast members of this movie have noted that the budget pretty much ran out near the end. Fortunately by then you are so fascinated to find out how it will all end the shortcuts are easy to ignore. This is one you remember. There's a certain type of convert - to religion, politics, you name it - who is so sure of him or herself they just can't ever stop and question whether they've substituted an arrogant certainty where faith and humility should reside. Seldom is this zealotry depicted in film, and if it is usually some secondary character wears the label, all the better to comment on or contrast with the actions of the main characters. Here that character is front and center. The sin of pride born of absolute certainty is Mimi Rogers real co-star. Rogers is so effective here because her zealotry is low-key. She is soft spoken and serene, a lovely woman. Only gradually do we see how deep rooted is her need to understand God in her own way and how convinced she is that she's doing it absolutely the right way. Movies never, ever take a certain type of religious conversion all the way to such a logical conclusion. For me, that's what makes this movie such a stunner. I've always been sorry this film never got it's due in the theatrical release, but the subject matter, coming after an opening act glimpse of Rogers' empty sexual adventuring, probably made it a double whammy for timid theater owners. If it were released next week somehow I don't think it would be nearly as ignored as it was. I only made an effort to see it because Roger Ebert paid it some special attention in his review, and I'm glad I did. This movie needs a DVD release, because it definitely is an overlooked and memorable film that should prompt many a conversation about worthwhile matters of the spirit. As I write this there is a certain amount of criticism of Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" coming from various corners, including one film critic who claims that Hollywood dislikes religion. ""The Rapture"" seems to me a perfect example of a movie designed to start useful discussions about what it means to be outwardly ""religious"" in an ""us vs. them"" mindset rather than truly, inclusively spiritual. I don't recall any public commentary about this movie when it came out at all, yet I'd say it is far more the provocative of the two.",420,59,21,False

Director Tolkin noted that Rogers' Scientology beliefs played no bearing on her casting: ""Mimi's background in Scientology played no role in my casting her, nor did I see it as a problem — we never even discussed it."" Rogers added that ""my own religious views didn't affect my approach to the picture at all."" Although in another interview, she noted that the role was easier by way of not having a traditional view of Jesus: ""I don't, for example, have a Jesus Christ definition of God ... and I have no views on heaven or hell. To me they're alien concepts. If I were a practicing Christian or a Jew, with all the hang-ups of those religions, I don't think I could have done Sharon justice."" This film is fascinating, and Rogers' views do add something to the picture, whether intentional or not. hat about Duchovny? I was introduced to this film around 2000 or 2001 in the context of it being a horror film. And, you know, it is not a horror film, but does seem to have some of those elements -- there is a sense of dread about making the wrong choices. Take pride in yourself? Give in to God? Risk an eternal damnation? And now (2016) I have a philosophy background, which makes the film interesting in new ways. Nothing about it is terribly deep, but it does realistically cover the issues of religion, particularly atheism versus Christianity. What would make an atheist convert, and why would they want to?

SHAME, SHAME, SHAME on you for marketing the home video of this very important film as if it were a soft-core sex romp. The original artwork for the film captured its essence very well (the soundtrack on CD has the original artwork), but the VHS video box cover on the front shows Mimi Rogers looking like she had the biggest...well, you know...sexual thrill of her life. The back cover shows a shirtless David Duchovny (but with a look on his face like a deer caught in the headlights). The cover says ""exploring a woman's sexual and spiritual awakening."" Excuse me, but Mimi Rogers' character seems to already be well educated in sex by revealing that she likes to swing with friend Patrick Bauchau. Sure, there is some sex in the first part of the film, but the story as a whole is 95% about the spiritual part. I'd love to yell at the person who got the job of marketing that cover and say how it really is an insult to people's intelligence in general. The Current DVD cover unfortunately makes it look like a religious family film...a big mistake. Should have kept the original artwork (again, see the soundtrack CD cover for that). NOW, for the praise. The Rapture is one of those rare films that refuses to compromise and doesn't apologize if it offends one's religious beliefs. Mimi Rogers is a telephone operator with a very unremarkable life. Even her sexual experiences with her friend seem to be boring her. She eventually overhears co-workers talking about ""The Boy"" and she is intrigued by the secrecy surrounding him. She eventually gets involved with this religious group and as time passes, gets married, has a daughter, and continues her religious life. Then things get a bit....bizarre. It leads to a conclusion that may anger those who are devout and get a a lot of respect from those that feel there are many things we just shouldn't settle for in our existence. I'm not an Academy Award nut, but the fact that Mimi Rogers was overlooked for a nomination is ""sacrilege""...excuse me, but in reviewing something like this film some puns are inevitable! The one scene that most everyone I know refers to specifically is the one where Mimi confesses a crime to policeman Will Patton on the side of a road. Watching her emotional pain as she cries out how she can't love God anymore tears me up every time I see it, and it leaves you in a weakened state for the rest of the film. And the rest of the film will have you in a state of amazement right through to its fade. I was so impressed by the uncompromising conclusion and while some may feel that maybe Mimi didn't really win in the end, I feel she did. I too want to know why people think God solely has us here to worship, worship, worship -- at one point Mimi even asks co-workers ""Isn't that a bit selfish?"" While we don't get the answers we seek in this film, at least it challenges our minds and gets us talking. I can't recall any other film that has an effect to such an extent as The Rapture.

So much loving attention to detail in the writing and professionalism in the execution. Which means we can get down to the message.

And, to me, that's water way, way, long under the bridge. I can't see that the territory this flick explores is universal or timeless. A lot of this kind of religion--where belief and faith are rather conflated--is a sad waste of energy. The way true religion should be approached by folks looks *nothing* like *anything* in this flick. And it doesn't matter whether you see the flick as strangely accommodating evangelical ""faith"", or as an outright repudiation of this sort of experience as ultimately hollow. There is so, so much more to what faith can mean in a person's life than anything that this flick may be trying to aim at. So, to me, the flick seems sorta ""stuck"", in a general way, in that old place where belief and faith get lumped together... man, that's old news!

This is a film that does not cheat or take the easy way out when dealing with this sensitive subject matter. Tolkin paints a believable portrait of a woman's newfound faith, as well as effectively challenging viewers to question their own spiritual beliefs. This is a film that asks hard questions and refuses to provide easy answers; it simply allows us to share the pain, confusion, and angry of it's heroine in a unrelenting and unsentimental manner. The cast is flawless. Mimi Rogers is terrific as the woman whose immense faith gives her a purpose, but she ultimately feels that it costs her too much. A pre-""X-files"" David Duchovny brings depth to the potentially-thankless role of the former thug that Rogers becomes determined to save, a role that is fleshed out immeasurably by Duchovny's disarming matter-of-fact portrayal. The delightfully smarmy Patrick Bauchau is hilariously smug as Rogers' fellow swinger, while fresh-faced child actress Kimberly Cullum handles several extremely difficult, emotionally-heavy scenes with a deft authority that betrays her tender age. The film makes the unusual transition from gritty character study to full-throttle apocalypse fantasy, but Tolkin manages to keep everything feeling realistic and believable. The film contains an array of discrete-yet-stimulating optical effects and scene compositions, all of which enhance the human story instead of distracting from it. Praised by open-minded critics and audiences, but shunned by many conservative types, THE RAPTURE is a moving and thought-provoking experience that manages to be dark, humorous, touching, and disturbing. It has a sort of brilliance that we see too little of in the film-world today.",291,6,2,False

Starring Mimi Rogers as Sharon, in a film her ex-TC would have no doubt prevented her from doing back in their day, Rogers' character is the stereotypical information operator by day/swinger sin-sister by night. The extreme binary of her character makes for hysterical lines when she decides to convert to a cultish Christianity based on the notion of prophesy. With David Duchovny in an early semi-naked role as the firm, young, stud whom Rogers cavorts and later marries, and Will Patton as a sheriff who encounters the demented Sharon who has followed her faith into the wilderness, the male balance to this film is one of flesh and reason made secondary to literal interpretation of scripture in vacuous gestures of uncritical blind faith without rationale. Frankly, other films have addressed questions of faith and belief in more sophisticated ways than the heavy-handed approach of The Rapture, and it is far more satisfying to compare those with this attempt. While Rogers is lauded for this performance, it is a complex character but the actress interpretation is shallow and so pulled back that it makes for an uneven and superficial read, however, I think this is more the fault of the director than the actress. On first viewing, I thought this film was intriguing, but after several viewings in the interim years, it becomes more laughable and comedic than worthy of intense reflection or serious attention.",279,8,10,False

Sharon is clearly a mental case. Her major sinful act toward the end nails that, for sure. I suppose that her insanity adds to the drama, but it also kind of implies that Christians are crazy and deluded. But then, the Rapture actually occurs. The message is confusing.

What the hell are you people smoking? What a laughably bad movie this is...and I don't care what side of the religious line you fall on. I missed the first few minutes of the movie, and came in on the part where Mimi has just finished scrubbing the nasty Duchovny cooties off her. The film plods along until she gets the idea to go camping in the desert. Mimi kills her kid to send her to heaven, rather than waiting for the rapture that's supposedly just around the corner anyway, and then gets PO'd at God. The other characters of the movie are all as idiotic acting; I was especially bemused by the cop's character. Some dirty crazy woman has just admitted to killing her kid, and the cops only reaction is to talk about religion? Give me a f*****g break. After he finally is recalled to his duty and drags this psycho to jail, everyone there has also drank the Kool-aid. The part that made me laugh out loud? The TV in the jail breaks away from regular programming and begins televising the rapture! The cop & the psycho take a motorcycle cruise and meet up with the 4 horsemen on a trail ride. Then she tells God to go to hell, the end. I originally gave the movie 1 star (because I couldn't rate it 0 stars). But then reconsidered and give it 2 stars, because David Duchovny was surprisingly hot in the beginning, what with all the naked chest / long hair action going on. Too bad that part was so short. As an atheist maybe I'm lacking the necessary frame of mind to view films with religious content.

Among these are an even rarer breed, films which mesmerize the viewer, sometimes for no other reason than the provocative subject matter. I suppose, since such films ARE so rare, this creates the attraction for the viewer in itself - something different, something rare, something we're not used to seeing. Nowadays, such rarity is a product of some new, unseen special effect, some new computer visual. In this film, however, it's a rarely viewed idea, an unrealized thought, a theory or premise never before presented. It, the idea, revolves around religion, which, even more so than politics, is usually cause for arguments, killings, and all-out war. For most viewers, potential and past, the story can be at least slightly disturbing and even frightening. It goes to the core of existence - its meaning or lack thereof. Such a concept, as already mentioned, is not something most film-watchers are expecting and may not even be prepared for. You are forced to think by the time it's over. If your main goal in life at the moment is finding out how many characters you can kill in your new video game, this movie is not for you. Even so, this may be the type of film which could awaken certain thinking processes in an otherwise blank slate. It's confounding in a way because anyone from a devout Christian to a steadfast atheist can view this and gain some appreciation for what the film is trying to say. I'm not going to go into the details of the plot as anyone can get that elsewhere and, besides, I believe it's better for any individual to see this without too many preconceptions or slanted viewpoints beforehand. Perhaps this is why it is so confounding: you realize we ARE all individuals, with our own fears, desires and beliefs, when such a film generates different reactions & debate from each viewer. There may be similarities, sure, but there is always at least a slight deviation in each person's outlook. And there are so many layers to all the questions and facets of the film: the relationship between God and human beings; the limits, if any, of human responsibility vs. that of God; the nature of human sin - is there any actual sin? These are just for starters, beyond the more basic questions of what actually happens to us after death. The lead character here (Rogers) undergoes an odyssey and a personal evolution beyond anything ever seen on film. It's a character arc, I would think, any actor would sell their soul for. Rogers carries it off and it's astounding that not more people are aware of this performance. By the end, the viewer is stuck with her, mesmerized. What's her next move? If you're a Christian, you may lean towards the theory she's in hell, baby. If you're an atheist, you may think, she's hallucinating all this out of grief and madness. Either way works, doesn't it?

God and Satan were having a conversation and God claimed he could test any believer without breaking him. I don't remember why he picked Job, a devout man, but, boy, did God test him. (Woody Allan might ask why God didn't give Job a written exam instead.) This is a kind of Job story. I began watching it because, frankly, I was hoping Mimi Rogers might uncover part of her magnificent torso but I stayed because I got caught up in this complex story of a rather simple belief system. Mimi is put to the test too. And there is a sort of cultish group thrown in, made up of people who have seen the light. What does the light look like? According to the script it has something to do with a dream about a pearl. I am being a little vague on this point because the film is vague. (Also I don't know how pearls figure so markedly in a mythos with a desert background.) And the version of Christianity the film present us with is truly primitive. There are constant references to Jesus Christ, although the acts of God we witness reflect the temper of the angrier God of the Old Testament more than the merciful God of the New. How can you be saved? It's easy. You love Jesus Christ and do whatever God orders you too. A reasonable person, as the spouse-swapping Rogers is at the beginning, might ask, ""The Buddhists seem to get along without Jesus Christ,"" and the Hindus and Moslems too, and the converted come right back with a smiling answer, ""But they are not saved."" I guess that leaves out the Jews too, although Christians worship the same God, but only through an intermediary, and with different rituals. The movie was especially gripping when Rogers apparently has a vision in which she is to take her daughter to the desert and wait for the end of the world. She takes only the necessities -- no money and no food -- expecting the arrival of Gabriel and the rest at any moment. Her date stands her up. She turns more raggedy with each day and finally does something terrible and is brought to jail by a sheriff's deputy (Will Patton in a sympathetic role for a change). Then the world ends with a minimum of special effects. Her daughter and Patton wind up in heaven, but Rogers is bitter about having been disappointed by God and evidently winds up spending eternity in Purgatory. That's it, folks. I don't know whose side the movie is on -- the born-agains who glow with the inner light of sanctimony, or people like Rogers who find that a God capable of such cruelty is not worth loving unconditionally. I suppose if Heaven is a good idea, it's better to surrender to God, especially if you're looking for an ""exclusive neighborhood"" to live in. Yet we're left admiring Rogers for having made up her own mind. She believes fiercely, first in God, and then in her distaste for Him. All the while I kept thinking that this movie deals with the kind of Big Issues that European directors are so fond of. I have a feeling that if it had been shot by the French, the story might have been very similar, beginning with all that ontological Angst, but that the central question would have dealt not with God but with Marx or Marcuse or somebody.",590,6,7,False

What this movie lacked, and which Mimi Rogers demonstrates so well in the final act, is the notion of faith in the face of overwhelming doubt. Instead of portraying Sharon as the insightful and thoughtful Christian, Tolkin asks her to embrace the ultimately doomed notion of blind faith. Ironically enough, that tends to be the quickest way to see the light--that of cold reason and reality.

This if one of those films that tries to do the impossible: present a theme based on all resolutions of a belief -- and do justice to them all. In my view, I found it did so. Why do I say this is hard to do? For most filmmakers venturing in this arena, try to PUSH a belief on you. Here you are presented with all sides of a Christan Religious Issue -- and either you are left with the same conflicts as the characters (which are unresolved, so don't expect an answer!) or you just don't care, for this is not your thing. Mimi Rogers was excellent as the central character in this film. This character is shown completely raw and she goes from being the morally worst human being, to what is perceived as the best. Being that she has gone through both sides, she is left with challenges and a problem: If she lived her life as a sinner, then 'finds the Lord', lives her life in Christian Living, has a family, goes to and participates in Church every week....and then all Hell brakes lose (the Apocalypse, for short)...what to do? It's REAL judgment day for sins and here she stands with several things in her balance. Are we to understand that...she snaps? Did she snap? Are we to understand that her interpretation of being a Christian was too much to see life's daily problems and overcome those? Are we to understand that she was getting ""payback"" for her past sinful life even after she ""found the Lord""? I could go on, and these are the HARD questions folks. The ones no one wants to talk about, but this movie does. This film does bring discussion and question.

In the ending where Sharon and the Sheriff got to choose whether or not they want to go to Heaven or Hell just by saying they love God is simply not true at all.

Unlike the movie portrayed, this is absolutely not a decision that we get to make after we die or the Rapture comes; it is a decision that has to be made while we are still alive and on this earth. What should have happened in the ending if this movie was portraying truth from the Bible is that since Sharon believed in Christ earlier in her life, she should have been allowed to enter in Heaven and the sheriff,who by his own choice, did not believe in Christ, would be the one staying in Hell (called the Lake of Fire in the Bible, which is eternal separation from God). Even if someone chooses to only believe in Christ for one second of their life and then completely changes their mind, chooses to get angry at God and then, chooses never to believe in Christ again for the rest of their life, they are still very much saved and going to Heaven. That is God's grace and the wonderful, just, fair, loving, true God that we really have, Who freely gave all of us the very best Heaven had to offer, His only Son,The Lord Jesus Christ, Who died and completely paid for all the sins of the whole world, not the false god that was portrayed in this movie.",337,11,22,True

Basically in Los Angeles, Sharon (Mimi Rogers) is a young woman who works a very boring job as a telephone operator, in her spare time she cruises bars and engages in swinging, along with her boyfriend Randy (David Duchovny). One day, Sharon has a knock on the door from a pair of evangelists, she lets them in, they preach God to her and warn her that the Rapture is coming. Soon she notices little things around her that relate to the words the men spoke, including conversations she overhears between her colleagues, and a strange, mystical tattoo on the back of a woman joining her in a sex session. Eventually, Sharon becomes a born-again Christian, a few years later she is living a pious life, constantly trying to spread the word of God herself, and relating any event, mundane or monumental, to the will of God. Sharon and Randy get married, and have a daughter, Mary (Kimberly Cullum), but when Randy is killed in a senseless murder, Sharon begins to question the benevolence of God, and she believes the Rapture is now imminent. She believes that God is calling her to go to the desert to await the Rapture, rather than leaving Mary to be looked after by friends, she decides her daughter must go with her. A few days pass with nothing happening in the desert, Mary constantly questions her mother, they have very little food, and Police Deputy Foster (Entrapment's Will Patton) becomes concerned for their well-being. Sharon insists the end is coming, but begins to despair, Mary urges that if they die now, then they will go to Heaven and not have to wait. Sharon kills her daughter with a gunshot to the head, but is unable to take her own life, fearing that she will be condemned by God, she confesses to Foster what she has done and is taken to a jail cell. In jail, an apparition of Mary appears, beside two angels, the Rapture occurs, a loud trumpet blast is heard around the world, and everything around is torn apart, until all that is left is a purgatory-like landscape. Driving out into the desert once again, Foster was originally an atheist, but he accepts God and is taken to Heaven, but Sharon blames God for the death of Mary, even though God did not tell her to bring Mary with her to the desert. Mary pleads with her to accept God back into her heart, so she can join her and Randy in Heaven, but Sharon cannot renounce her anger at what she sees as God's cruelty, she refuses, choosing to remain alone in purgatory for eternity.

There are however two things for which this film may be watched. The first is Ms. Rogers' acting. Ms. Rogers is a consummate actress, and her performance is very good. One is sorry to see it thus wasted. The other thing is that the naked flesh in the movie, including Ms. Rogers' is, rather nice. The latter may be contrasted with the American filmmaker's tendency of displaying underfed women with minimal charms in the buff. Remember Ms. Paltrow in 'Shakespeare in Love'? Three women are shown partially or completely nude, and they do not disappoint. What the movie is trying to say is difficult to determine. It certainly is not a simple story, told straight.

But this time, I was forced to do so, and I speak here as a Christian who watched this movie hoping it will project the Christian faith, as most other Christian movies strive to do. Let me say that this movie is the worst that you could ever watch, first of all, it has scenes that could only be rated 25+, don't watch this movie with your kids, or parents. Not even your wife! Just close the blinds and hope that no one sees you watching the unsavory scenes. Second, it's the worst misrepresentation of the Christian bible, nothing in it is even remotely close to the Christian based Faith, an example is where the main actress claims that there are two Jesus in heaven; one for little kids, and the other for adults. It makes me believe that it the writer, director, and all the crew have never read the bible. When I say that all things are a misrepresentation, most of you won't believe, but let me assure you that even the phrase 'misrepresentation' is an understatement. If you are looking for biblical truths or a Christian representation of your faith, stop! you won't find it here. But I guess its a good material for a cultist, 'the lost'. Don't be! Finally, the concept of a boy, heading a church, whereby he is the only one who gets inspiration from God, will do more harm than good for people who are searching for the right way to God.

I apparently viewed this film from a somewhat different perspective than many other IMDb voters. I don't know the director's intent, but I felt the film exemplified the drawbacks and pitfalls of extreme positions and/or lifestyles. The central character, vividly portrayed by Mimi Rogers, leads a very loose lifestyle in the initial stages of the film and converts to an overly rigid lifestyle in the latter stages after becoming disenchanted and seemingly depressed with what was transpiring in her life. Viewers can judge for themselves whether one type of extremism is preferable to the other. In my opinion, many types of groups or cults (politically or religiously inspired) capitalize on people searching for a person or group who can dramatically change what they perceive as an unrewarding existence. This film may draw, intense positive or negative, response from people with extreme religious positions. Not placing myself at either end of that spectrum, I was deeply interested in the film but felt that it lost some of its impact and possibly a couple of rating points, over the final half hour of the presentation. Mimi Rogers gives a strong performance in a film in which she is required to shoulder the burden. It's not that the other actors give sub-par performances. It's just that the film is so primarily structured around Mimi's character that she is required to carry the load and does so extremely well. In my opinion, an IMDb rating of between 3 and 8 would seem to fit this religiously provocative drama. I personally gave it a 4 out of 10 and would recommend it for viewers who are not offended by loose sexual lifestyles or exploring intense religious attitudes.",301,3,6,True

Agenda aside (hidden or otherwise), director Michael Tolkin is clearly more adept at depicting sin than salvation, allowing born-again moralists the chance to enjoy, in good conscience, a lot of truly erotic flesh games before the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse make their appearance.

imdb_the_rapture_budniewski1_20250823,The Rapture,IMDb,budniewski1,2025-08-23,9,A Courageous Confrontation With God's Conscience,"I like Christian End Times films. They can be terribly entertaining. That's where it stops. These contributions to Christian eschatology rarely move me to love Jesus. If anything, they have an adverse effect on my faith. For instance: God raptures thousands of motorists, pilots, and train engineers, causing mass death before victims have a chance to repent and accept Jesus. So, they go to hell. This isn't right. ""Who forgives God?"" Mimi Rogers' character, Sharon, asks scornfully near the end of The Rapture (not to be confused with the 2019 Christian film Rapture which is one of the most useless pieces of rubbish ever put to film). Michael Tolkin's script follows Sharon through three distinct phases: sordid swinger, cultish believer, and desert disciple. This is a drastic evolution, one that might stretch the continuity of character in feebler hands than Rogers'. Were The Rapture a better-funded and, frankly, more normal movie, she might have been up for an Oscar. It isn't that Tolkin's movie is hard to follow. The script is very linear, and Apocalypse flicks are familiar enough - if often relegated to the Christian networks for their unabashed preachiness. What's different here is the unsettled mood; palpable, even visible, like a filter over the camera lens. It starts with a long pan of a gray, boxy call center, humming with the rote script of operators. It continues in sex scenes involving Sharon, her friend Vic, and random couples they meet. One context is drab with tedium, the other colored in lust. Both are tinted with the same tense foreboding. This continues after Sharon is drawn, by a strange pearl tattoo on Vic's transient partner's back, into a doomsday sect. Even when the film portrays the satisfaction of meaning, something isn't quite right. The uneasy feeling hovers. Sharon is heading to a deeper confrontation than even crashing mountains and locust plagues. For, this is not a trial of faith, but the heart. The sect (or, more aptly, cult) centers on visions of the white pearl floating in black space and a seer simply known as ""The Boy."" The group's intensity is muted. They are profoundly self-assured, content to go around preaching with firm passivity and the requisite glassy eyes. In the context of this movie, one knows they're right. Tolkin does not toy at all with mass delusion: the idea that Sharon had the same vision as everyone else because she is supposed to. Questioning her - or, for that matter, any Christian's - truth isn't the point of The Rapture (at least not directly). The inner conflict is reckoning with this truth when the underside is revealed. Sharon's relationship with David Duchovny's atheist character, Randy, is the weakest part of the film. While it's understandable to skip a bunch of years, Randy's conversion arc is more of a warp into another person. Suddenly, he's a business executive and a pious family man. I'd argue the real purpose is to give Sharon a daughter with whom she can keep vigil in the desert waiting to be raptured. What seems inevitable in any movie called The Rapture may or may not happen. Either way, Sharon commits an unspeakably shocking sacrifice. This act and its red tape, realized mere seconds too late, lays bare the difficulty posed by the ""real"" Christian God. Tolkin skillfully simplifies theology, removing from conversation the generous sacrifice of Jesus and guiles of the devil (pillars of generic Rapture films). This allows an almost personal dialogue with God the Father. The piddly human voice targets the great vulnerability of their religion, one Christians have struggled with for centuries: How does a loving God allow bad things to happen? It's never this simple, of course. Is God, the creator, a tyrannical taker? Did He really lead Sharon to the desert to suffer in waiting? Is He responsible for her choice to bring her daughter along? Above all, what did He do about the unfathomable decision that followed? In a powerful rush of brilliantly blunt effects and cartoonish fever dream images, we experience this reckoning along with Sharon. Hers is not unlike the grinding agitation I feel during any faith-centric End Times film. It's good not to be alone. Tolkin's film is not perfect. There are one of two ""why is this here"" scenes. Duchovny doesn't bring much to the party. The pacing wanders a bit. I can forgive all of this. If challenging the viewer, questioning accepted explanations, and offering a different lens to reality are measures of a film's excellence, The Rapture gets high marks.

A lot of films dramatize the central character's search for the truth, but ""The Rapture"" is different because the truth isn't all that well-defined. You think you see it, but there are so many false leads, and the movie avoids the normal saccharine ending where conflicts are settled and all is well in the world. Mimi Rodgers plays a telephone operator in Los Angeles who cruises the bars at night with a roguish friend looking for casual sex with other couples. Her life is empty and eventually she's steered towards becoming a born-again Christian, but does she really make the conversion? When her husband is murdered and she's directed by the boy prophet in her prayer group to go out into the desert because God has something in mind for her, her beliefs are challenged. She and her young daughter expect that God is ready to summon them up to Heaven, but after weeks go by and nothing happens, she begins to despair again. Her daughter wants to die so she can be with her daddy again, so Mimi shoots her but chickens out and can't kill herself. This movie works on several levels, because there's an element of ridicule towards the fundamentalist beliefs of the Christian faith. There's something absurd about a person believing it's OK to shoot your daughter so she can go to Heaven. In the strict confines of biblical doctrine, this might be true, but when you see the killing carried out, you naturally pull back and question it. The boy in the group's prayer circle also seems to be a false lead because his prophecies are cold and misleading to the other people. But, the movie ends with the Apocalypse, with the blowing of Gabriel's horn and the summoning of all the believers to Heaven, so it's not an outright rejection of the fundamental teachings of the Christian faith. It raises many questions and doesn't answer all of them, which is cool because too many films try to wrap everything up neatly at the end. Mimi Rodgers is terrific as the woman who despairs of the life she's been leading and who tries to find faith in God. Will Patton plays a kindly police officer who encounters Mimi and her little girl out in the desert and tries to help them. His innate kindness and willingness to accept what life brings helps him to make the conversion at the end. But Mimi is still bitter about everything, about being misled to kill her daughter, about her husband's death, about all the rules she has to follow to get to Heaven, that she refuses to let go. There are some very eerie scenes in this movie that stick with you. The galloping horses of the Apocalypse, the blowing of Gabriel's horn and the jail disintegrating, the little girl pleading with her mommy to accept God, and then Mimi standing all alone in the darkness as she realizes that she's spending forever in the emptiness between Heaven and Hell.

It will never attain the accolades heaped upon high profile successes like Chinatown or 2001, but, in terms of ambition and achievement this film belongs in their company. Like those other films, The Rapture is an uncompromising cinematic exploration of spirituality and existence in late-20th century America. Through the central character of Sharon, writer-director Michael Tolkin examines the jaded ennui to which many succumb. Sharon seeks solace in the arms and loins of others the way some people turn to chemical dependence or fundamentalism. Finding the embrace of her lovers lacking the vitality she needs, Sharon finds God in the vision of a rotating, heavenly pearl. Flash forward--the apocalypse is nigh and, following the death of her husband (another reformed ""sinner""), she treks to the desert, daughter in tow to await Jesus's return. Ultimately, Sharon finds herself on the precipice between paradise and eternal loneliness; she chooses solitude. What is ultimately remarkable about this film is the way in which it doesn't reject the tenets of fundamentalist Christianity; it engages these beliefs in a respectful but critical dialogue and leaves the viewer to decide where they stand. Belief in the rapture is not dismissed--Tolkin buys into it for the sake of his film and allows his characters to encounter the end days. A lesser movie would have undermined the final 20 minutes by explaining it away as delusion. Tolkin does no such thing. In The Rapture, the verity of the apocalypse is never explicit, but there is little within the film to offer a notion that it's simply Sharon's imagination. Or a lesser movie would have found Sharon reuniting with her deceased husband and daughter. She would have chosen to submit herself at the end, ascending, like Deputy Foster. That's the point of the movie, though, and the mark of Sharon's progression as a character--she moves away from submission to independence. At the beginning, she is a slave to men, following Vic out on his nightly prowls. Finding that lacking, she turns to another man--Jesus--in the hopes that he will fill her with the sense of purpose she desires. Upon killing her only child, she realizes that this man too has left her empty and caused her to lose the only thing in her world that mattered. In the end, Sharon chooses independence and stand alone, surrounded by the void. It's an incredibly liberating denouement (for women) and an intriguing premise. It's all the more interesting in that it does this without taking pot-shots at religious faith. In my reading, the movie does not fault Christianity or any religion--it faults the people that blindly look to some crutch for happiness in guidance before finding it in themselves. In other words, first know thyself, then know God. Religion does not cause Sharon to shoot her daughter--she chooses to do so on her own",487,2,3,True
imdb_the_rapture_galvestonsteve_20230719,The Rapture,IMDb,galvestonsteve,2023-07-19,4,Good luck with this one.,"I truly wish I hadn't seen this film. I kept waiting for some sort of resolution that might make sense of what I was seeing, but it never happened. The director did a very poor job of telling his story, although the actors were fine (for the most part). Many of the characters were highly annoying Jesus freaks. You know, the ones who are forever toting a Bible and are 100% convinced that they and they alone have the truth. The types who are warned to stay away from other's homes w/ signs on their front gates saying ""NO (fill in the blank w/ your most brainwashed Christian Evangelical cults)!"" Having grown up in The American South, hard line Christianity was hard to avoid. But the people in this film, who were convinced that the End Time was right around the corner, were a type that we seldom saw but avoided when we did see them. Truthfully, I didn't see of them in school but you knew they were around, especially in the 60's and 70's when people were challenging authority, trying out free love and refusing to fight in an unjust war overseas. This film should be rated X due to the scene where Mimi shoots her own daughter so that she can go to heaven, and then actually meets her later on in the film. This sort of scene could give some children nightmares because parents like Mimi exist in this world. I wish the director had made more of an effort to show that these supposedly ""saved"" individuals were extremely dangerous religious lunatics who might be living next to you and I. He simply shows them as people who meant good and were convinced of their wacko beliefs. People like that are truly dangerous because they will do ANYTHING, pay any price, and roll right over anyone that gets in their way or hinders their cause because in their confused minds, God is on their side. Lots of stereotypes in the film too. Knowing that Mimi had been married to Tom Cruise at one time and they both had been a part of the dangerous Scientology cult, the film really doesn't address this at all. All the focus is on the extreme Christian End Time cults. Lots of mixed messages in this film, and I would never recommend it to anyone due to its totally confusing message.",400,1,1,False

I've noted that I used to enjoy movies like God's Not Dead just for having Christian slapped on as a label. I applied that to The Rapture as well. The Rapture isn't really a faith-based movie, but it does deal with religion. But how? Is it a critique of religious belief? Of end time theology? Of over-zealousness? Either way, The Rapture is very flawed. The Rapture follows Sharon, a telephone operator who feels as if life is empty. She goes to work by day and has sex with numerous men at night. One day she considers suicide, until some Bible salesmen hands her a New Testament. She takes it, just so they can leave her alone. She then decides to read it and converts to the Christian faith. Revelation takes her interest most, and she looks forward to The Rapture, the return of Jesus. One issue of the movie is how it portrays Sharon's preaching. Once converted, she takes her operator calls and instead of asking what number they desire, she asks if they know God, and preaches on the job. Her boss sets her aside to discuss this, but instead of criticizing it, he excitedly discusses end times with her. After following Sharon for a fair chunk of the movie (maybe half at most), we see that she has a daughter, maybe 8 or 9 years old. She never mentions her, nor has such time seemed to pass. Where did this come from? One moment, she's a lonely woman, next she has a daughter? In angst for The Rapture, she takes her daughter into the blazing desert, assuming Jesus will just come to take them. They wait days and days for His return, with no preparations. Her daughter complains of hunger, since Sharon brought no food. She finally decides to get her some fast food, and when grabbing the food, she speeds to avoid paying for it. I guess stealing for Jesus is a thing. A police officer observes Sharon's wait in the desert, and he questions her but does nothing more. Finally, Sharon can't wait for Jesus to come, so she pulls out a gun (like the daughter, where were we to assume or know she had a gun?), and she points it at her child. She asks her if she really believes in Jesus, and the girl sobs that she does. Then, so the girl can be with God, she shoots her own daughter! Sharon tells this to the officer, distressed that this didn't bring The Rapture. It is THEN that he arrests her, and there the Apocalypse comes. Again, is this a criticism of religion? If so, it doesn't make sense. Not all Christians are extreme to this level- I can't think of any one personally who would shoot their own child so The Rapture could happen. That's not to say the nutty believers are non-existent, but to this extreme? I doubt it. The filmmakers simply created a character who became a Christian without understanding what that really means. The Rapture is a poor film on many levels. It's extreme, incoherent, and it doesn't seem to know what message it's trying to send. I don't see how this was Roger Ebert's 10th favorite movie of 1991, one of the key reasons I saw it in the first place. Regardless of the point this film is trying to make, The Rapture is more mind boggling than the book of Revelation itself.

If you love Him, you will go: To Heaven. Without abating the serious gravity of the religious problem too much, these are the sort of ""logical"" deductions one encounters in The Rapture, a 1993 film directed by fiction writer (winner of the Edgar Allen Poe Award), Michel Tolkin. A surface-only glance at Tolkin's highly conceived, The Rapture, will invite associations with the not too dissimilar film-making stylistics discoverable in the low-studio-budggie, yet entirely for profit, commercially slick in pitch and tone, and even in the pleasantly familiar cast of, yes indeed, a late-night Skinamax special. But The Rapture, don't let it fool you Girls, is a well wrought little exercise in philosophical reflection on the quest for religious meaning in the context of post-modern US America. Mimi Rogers plays Sharon, an empty-sexed swinger who works in a call-center cube-farm. Approaching forty and ""dating"" Vic, a likewise sexually vacant and older by at least a decade balding man that exudes wealth; Sharon is more or less that loopy, a little better than marginally attractive 40ish gal with whom you inadvertently find yourself in the middle of a gleefull but entirely awkward encounter there in your fluorescently lit tenth-floor corporate breakroom lobby; perhaps you're having an all-out bizarre discussion about, oh, I don't know, ""Have you seen the Pearl?"" So keeping up with sex-parties (just what is this woman at the desk next to me into?) long enough to meet, David Duchovny, who apparently plays himself in the film, a man with a past and whose best year was 1976, protagonist, Sharon, manages to sway young David, despite his well reasoned, overly rational objections (""Some people use heroin. You use God."") over to her religious transformation reform scheme and finally let go of those dirty times before. The two justify their own lives by marrying, having a child, and playing out this drama of a generally boring and implausible suburban lifestyle which stands in direct contrast to the vicissitudes of, how do you say, uh, real life and the kind of visual material you catch on the evening news. It could be that the fulsome couple already played their hand with devil and guess who's back to roost? It's that old song for the goat, Tragedy. Yep. Welcome back! So when things go from bad to good, then good to bad and bad to worse, when you can't blame your boyfriend, you can't blame the cops, you can't even blame yourself because ""there's more than just you out there, right?""

I wonder if the viewers who ascribed to this notion really were focused on the film.She killed her daughter because her child was suffering from hunger as well as psychologically ,missing her father and suffering for not being able to see him in Heaven faster.She killed out of compassion.If there were somebody who was impatient that was her little daughter.Sharon herself was suffering from doubts whether she was right or wrong to have taken her daughter to the desert with her.At a point in the film when she cannot endure her daughter's torment,before killing she says to her that she cannot let her suffer because of her mistake.But remember her little girl suggested many times in the film that they should commit suicide so they could go to their father in heaven faster.The little daughter is presented as misguided. The film at this point commits a crippling theological error.No Christian denomination accepts,that anyone who dies with the conviction that committing suicide to get to heaven quicker is right,can enter Heaven.Quite the contrary this is a totally misguided view that condemns you to hell.So one could say that at this moment the film loses touch with Christian reality. However the question that the film asks is,right from the start I think, ''Does God have the right to test us?''To me this the question the whole film centers around. Religion has philosophy in it and logic but it also has mystery.Some things we Christians believe simply because of our mystical communication with God.Because it ''feels right''.Personally I believe that yes, God has the right to test us,but he does this to help us purify our soul.Even Jesus Himself allowed Satan to test him in the desert as we all know.And he showed total devotion to God.Total trust. I guess Sharon's answer to the film's question was ''no'' and that is why the end shows her condemned by her anger towards God ,defying this right of His.She is condemned to a kind of Hell since there are various levels of Hell as of Paradise since justice is served even in this respect.After all not all people are Saints neither all criminals equally vicious and evil. But there can be no proper moral conclusions because sadly the film just prior to this point is damaged by the theological error I mentioned earlier.God loves us you see,and isn't looking for reasons to damn us to hell.He sent His only Son to die on the cross for us for our salvation.He would never therefore test us to the point where we would break and lose our soul.Only to the point that we would understand some things and be saved.And here lies the error of this interesting film.

In Mimi Rodgers' stunning performance, we are given a protagonist who goes from a joyless, orgiastic life of group sex, to a rigid, conservative Christian belief, and ultimately, an angry rejection of that belief. Every viewer will interpret her actions and the story's theme differently, but one way of looking at it is that her character Sharon gets mad at God for not doing things her way, completely overlooking the possibilities of free will, human evil, and just plain bad luck. The fact that the events near the end of the story take place in the desert, combined with Sharon's bitter remark that she will give God one more chance,suggest the New Testament story of Christ's temptation in the desert. The devil proposes a series of challenges, and Jesus responds at one point by quoting an Old Testament verse about not putting the Lord thy God to a foolish test.Later, Sharon bitterly denounces God for supposedly having broken his promise, but the fact is, she is responsible for all the suffering endured by her daughter and herself, and blames it on God.It is possible to see her as a person who has so denied her grief over her husband's death, that she has become delusional. The people in her religious group ask her how she can be sure that God is calling her out to the desert, and if it might not be a false vision of the devil. One interpretation is that she never really had a mature understanding of her faith to begin with, but had adopted a dogmatic, self-satisfied view of her Christian lifestyle, and was too proud to admit having made a mistake. This is a powerful film that demands a lot from the viewer. It is an unforgettable performance by Mimi Rodgers, and a thoughtful, challenging invitation to ask hard questions about faith.

I understand that this movie has many different interpretations, and is seen as a disturbing and confusing film, but I had a very clear take on it from the beginning. I'm not saying my take is right, and it certainly will be opposed, but since an opinion like mine doesn't seem to be posted yet, I thought I'd add it as a new way of looking at ""The Rapture."" Basically, religious fanaticism is bad. Mimi Rogers is unhappy because her life doesn't bring her close to anyone, and that's how a lot of people turn to being fanatical about religion ...which she does. (Heck, we even hear what her reasons are; That she wants something more from life, and doesn't know how to get it until she's reminded about the idea of ""Judgement Day."" Can the message that turning fanatical is a weakness be any more clear...?) Then, she preys on another victim; David Duchovini, who's weak-minded due to the guilt of murdering someone and, therefore, is easily convinced. (This is made clear by her Christian propaganda advertising over the phone, right?) Moving on, she totally can't mourn his death. She's spaced out in spiritual dogma. You know this is trouble, and it's only confirmed by her own hallucinations. (What, you think those pictures of David Duchovini in the desert were suppose to be real?? Like there were actually photos of her husband in the desert in the store somehow?? They were imagined by her from being unable to mourn! She's losing her marbles, obviously! How else do you explain that?! Come on, what other explanation do you have? We know it's not a glorious sign from a good-natured God, because of the conclusion to such a siting.) Now, we all know taking a child to a desert for weeks straight is a terrible idea, but she's already in the hole that is devout Christianity, and would have to be a weak character to get out now. But the hole of devout religion is much deeper than this, because it demands that she starve the child while waiting, set a bad example by stealing from drive-thru in front of the child, forcing her child to live off of candy bars in neglect for proper tooth-care, sacrifice her child like Abraham in the Bible was willing to just to end the young one's suffering, and bear the pain of living with that guilt ultimately to give her heart to the Lord that put her through this. That's what I think the movie is saying - That the price of dedication to religion is too high a price for reality, as we know it, to bare. I mean, what choice does she have? If she's faithful, she'll go to the desert, or else she's just 'ignoring God's sign.' But if she goes to the desert she's obviously screwed. So, what choice does her faith give her? Basically, if she believes in it, she's screwed, like so many people have become on the news in those trials of court. Next, we get a final confirmation that fanaticism is unhealthy for the individual and society. The devout Christian who always pleas his last attempt with, ""Watch, you'll be sorry when Judgement Day really comes!,"" is silenced. In this story, Christianity is real, Judgement Day does come, and we see the ultimate horrors and cruelty that religious fanatics have been advertising to us as 'good.' Mimi Rogers not only has to think well of killing her child, but do the impossible which is let God into her heart. She has just been given the impression that God is some deceiving, merciless, despotic tyrant, and she must let him into her heart in a limited amount of time immediately proceeding her tragic sufferings. Why? Oh, because Judgement Day has 'conveniently' occurred on that same day, and as we've been told so many times about Judgement Day, God will wait for no one by then. So, I'm not badgering religion or anything. I believe all religions can be good or bad, depending on one's interpretation of it. But, for reasons just stated, I feel this movie is attempting to show how extreme religious views are impossible ideals that can never bare fruit, even IF they end up becoming true. I give this movie a 10 because not only do I agree with this statement, but because no other film expresses this so powerfully.",737,0,1,True

This film opens in a telephone boiler room where the heroine leads a boring dehumanized existence as Operator 134 who is expected to spend no more than 15 seconds per call. Complaining of emptiness, we watch Operator 134 become a sex addict, but she finds that sex is also empty. Operator 134 then becomes a religion addict. Although religion does lead to her finally becoming Sharon, a person, at work, either work or religion drive her crazy. We see Operator 134 twice point a pistol at her head (a classic workplace joke). She is told to see a therapist, but does not. She is told to see a deprogrammer, but does not. Operator 134 continues her descent into madness and finally murders her child, and appears to wish to murder God. The movie ends with Operator 134 in jail turning over to sleep while asking ""Who forgives God?"" (presumably for creating the boiler room and for killing her little girl).

imdb_midsommar_manuel_medeiros_20200426,Midsommar,IMDb,manuel_medeiros,2020-04-26,8,How can something so f-ed up be so beautiful,"It is worth saying upfront that MidSommar should be a very divisive movie. If you tend to watch mostly popular movies or standard horror films, Midsommar is not for you. Which explains the amount of 1 out of 10 reviews here on IMDb, despite an overall 7.1 rating. But if you don't mind a slow building narrative with tension, innovative cinematography and plenty of look-away gore, then you might be able to appreciate just how unique Midsommar really is. Briefly - MidSommar shows us a group of friends going on what seems like an idyllic trip to the Midsummer festival in a village in Northern Sweden. But that quickly turns into a harrowing display of Pagan rituals and ceremonies. The movie is long because it's not afraid to take its time explaining the background of the characters (the group of friends and particularly the young woman in which it focuses). So from the start you can feel that this will be a different experience from most horror films. But the movie really takes off once they arrive in Sweden. And it goes a long way to explain why Ari Aster is being so buzzed as a new director. Some of the shots shown are, at least in my book, completely outside the norm. And early on help you involve in the world of the film, and in the experience of the main characters. In the terms of cinematography, it is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. And that becomes an even more impressive achievement because of its contrast with the horrid gore images displayed throughout the movie. The grass's green, the floral arrangements, the group dances, everything really paints a picturesque image of the Midsommar festivities. Despite all the unexpected events the characters are witnessing, that sense is kept all throughout 2h30 of film. All of the imagery helped me, as a viewer, to truly feel in the perspective of the characters. Walking into the festival, hopeful, experience the shock of everything that happens in front of them. I felt I too went on that trip with the characters, and I was shocked again and again together with them. It stuck with me for hours on end after watching. Which is one the best complements I can make to the work of a director in my view.

imdb_midsommar_lepidopterous__20190709,Midsommar,IMDb,Lepidopterous_,2019-07-09,9,An Operatic Catharsis On Emotional Dependency,"""I have always felt held. By a family... a real family. Do you feel held?"" One of the most universal and innately human desires is a sense of belonging. The human brain is not meant to be alone; we are evolved to be a part of something. Belonging fundamentally allows us to form our own sense of identity, establish social connections through community, and provides us with love, attention, security, and purpose. Perhaps more importantly, a lack of belonging is when we begin to lose sense of ourselves and who we are. This loss of touch with who we are when the world around us suddenly disappears... this slight loss of footing, dip in reality, always feeling somewhat displaced and perpetually unsettled... this encapsulates the mood of Ari Aster's Midsommar. Aster has delivered a psychedelic genre-defying horror fable that wins its audience by creeping into our darkest corners of angst, longing, and loneliness. At its core, the film is about a young woman who copes with crippling anxiety rooted in a desperate and fearful need for love as she comes to terms with the end of a relationship. It's about anxiety, fear of abandonment, and moving on. It is a meditation on human belonging; an operatic catharsis played on the strings of emotional dependency; a journey both inward and outward, to finally let go of something that was never meant to be. Midsommar is not a mystery or suspense movie. It unveils itself unapologetically, as if the filmmaker has no intention of hiding anything from us in the first place (the entire movie is visually depicted almost constantly in the background on walls or tapestries). Yet the film establishes its own rhythm and pacing. As the characters embark on a mushroom trip and grow weightless and spacey, so do we get entranced by the beautiful Swedish settings and sounds--at times indistinguishable from flutes being played by characters on-screen, and at other times, woven with a spell-binding aural hypnosis (listen to ""Attestupan"" without falling into a meditative trip). Like Hereditary before it, the casting is exceptional. Florence Pugh portrays and embodies isolation and anxiety so effectively that the ideas feel nearly concrete. Her part as Dani demands an incredible range and her commitment to the role is apparent. Her character has an air of desperation to her. A perfect casting for a lonely soul. Jack Reynor, a critical piece to this opera as the unlikeable and detached boyfriend, also delivers in a solid performance that leaves us conflicted, or at the very least, challenged. If Satan and Cannibal Corpse got together to shoot Blue Valentine in Sweden, I'd imagine it would be something like Midsommar. Aster taps into a dark and vulnerable place--he opens the door to chests you may have locked away and have had no intention of coming back to. If you've gone through a break-up recently, it may resonate even stronger. It's uncomfortable, unpleasant, but ultimately, cathartic. The director goes on to describe the film as almost a perverse wish-fulfillment fantasy. You see what you want to see. The inclusion of this overarching idea bears a universal relevance to how we can behave in the midst of the most toxic relationships. Entering the ethereal fog of Hårga perhaps a metaphor for willfully indulging in our clouded judgment to escape our fears. If Hereditary was a thematic exploration of inescapable fate, Midsommar is a tighter, more centered thematic reflection on emotional dependence. The thought given to the characters and script and the details within the various shots, symbols, and sounds will all surely leave many viewers coming back for more.

Director and writer Ari Aster had something very special with his first film Hereditary. Perhaps the film most recommended to me in the last few years. I have yet to see it, but after last night's screening of his 2nd and newest feature: Midsommar; I made immediate plans to rectify that. It's easy to just say a group of friends travel to Europe to write their college thesis on European pagan traditions but that would be a disservice to the early story Aster creates. I want to keep the plot description mum, but the early parts of this film are stricken with grief, angst, and some of the most realistic portrayals of gaslighting I've seen on film. These are the emotional bricks the story is constructed on. I never found myself waiting for them to just hurry up and go to Europe because the story is so effectively written and performed. Once they arrive to the small Swedish commune, the entire story starts shifting into something else entirely. We just get a feeling in our gut, all these smiling white people. Their all white garb, white teeth, white hair. It's an uneasy amount of white and cleanliness, positioned on gorgeous green hills speckled with bright blue, red, pink and purple flowers. Aster's use of color brilliantly fills the screen. It's a rather unsettling feeling: all this natural beauty and we can't take comfort in any of it. When we learn about the Midsommar festivities planned it seems like a big party for the students, we in the audience see the madness through the flowers. Things get turned to 11 quickly. We see people jumping to their deaths from towering cliffs, faces get smashed with hammers, faces get cutoff and worn as masks, menstrual blood consumed, incredibly graphic, brutal violence. Tonally it's a trip because there is also so much humor injected into the script. Mainly the joke of the kids freaking out and their smiling, white (oh so white) hosts calming them down; assuring them that this is all merely tradition. Smashing someone's head open with a large mallet is simply setting their willing soul free, it's not a big deal. You see? He likes getting his brains bashed in! It beats growing old in a nursing home! The things these kids get put through are wonderfully dreadful. Midsommar is a splendid display of young talent. Florence Pugh's portrayal of Dani is incredible. Her expressions are mesmerizing, she conveys so much emotion with her face. I felt a little less compelled by her boyfriend Christian played by Jack Reynor. We're very clearly not supposed to like his character, but I didn't like him due to his performance. It felt stiff and at times a little forced. Physically he was perfect for the role, but his delivery and timing left me feeling sort of...meh. Luckily the writing is so strong I never get too caught up in that. Even if one performance feels a little less compelling, the important part is the gang of young friends' performances and personalities work as a whole. Aster's ability to pace a 2-and-a-half-hour film and make it feel short is the genius. Every single scene feels important, there are so many details and carefully crafted instances of foreshadowing. Not heavy handed, but deft and nerve racking. In a time where attention spans are shrinking it's rewarding and refreshing to see a film not only take it's time but to do so in a way that makes the film work even better. It's not self-indulgent, it's vulnerable and enticing. I want to see this one again just to see exactly what he sets up earlier in the film. Midsommar is upsetting, grotesque, beautiful and humorous all at once. It's a great horror film and being as though it's only Aster's 2nd feature, the next step in his career is an exciting thought.",667,442,266,True

Actually some might not even read what I'm typing right now, dismissing or liking my review just based on the score I gave it. I'm not complaining or trying to get your attention. I gave this a 10/10, something that many would consider sacred (like how some people view trees or other things). But I think the movie deserves it. And while I watched the theatrical version in cinemas, I did watch the Directors Cut the other day too to get a complete picture - no pun intended. Now I know that pacing will be an issue for some - this takes its time and those expecting horror or their version of horror, will have quite a few issues with the movie. Especially in the long version (almost 3 hours). But the framing, the pictures you get are worth it. I would argue that if you ask Ari, why he chose that or this angle, why he lingered on that shot, why he used special effects that are subtle and almost not unnoticeable ... he will be able to answer them. He probably won't, letting you decipher and decide what you just watched, but he had a plan. He really knows his stuff. Now that doesn't mean that you will like the movie. Just because it is made with love and care and attention to every detail, does not make it invincible. It is a taste thing - what do you like to watch in movies. Subtle horror, that is also a drama?

The characters are not developed enough for us to feel that invested, and Christian, specifically, is too generic for us to care about him. POV keeps changing, which may work for slasher movies, but here... not so much. The worst moment in this sense is showing the red-haired girl getting ready for seduction: shouldn't we be always ""with"" the outsiders? Why are we ""alone"" with her? Bad scene. And... no climax. As we know everything that is going to happen (foreshadowing is largely used in tapestry, wall paintings, and dialogue), there are no surprises or reveals. Also, to work as a fable, it should be more distant from reality; to work as reality, it should be closer to it. There are many contrivances - are the boys really PhD students?

Feeling guilty about putting his girlfriend through further emotional trauma, Christian asks her to accompany him and his pals on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the remote ancestral village of their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who has invited them take part in the commune's nine-day midsummer festival. Director Ari Aster (Hereditary) might claim that Midsommar only pays homage to brilliant UK folk horror The Wicker Man, but all I can see is a blatant, bloated and extremely tedious rip-off. Where The Wicker Man (Director's Cut) runs at a reasonable 99 minutes, its engrossing story whisking the viewer along as Edward Woodward's character attempts to solve a mystery on a remote Scottish island, Aster's film (The Director's Cut) takes a whopping 171 minutes to tell its very familiar tale of unwary outsiders falling foul of an strange religion that practises bizarre rituals. Moving at a snail's pace, the first hour of Midsummar is a massive challenge for the viewer, as the students travel to the village of the Hårga, meet the locals, and take part in ancient rites which involve lots of chanting and taking of hallucinogens. Those who make it through this tedium will eventually be rewarded with a shocking scene that is the equivalent of Hereditary's decapitation (ie., it's designed to wake up the viewer and become a talking point): before the eyes of the horrified students, elders of the village throw themselves off a precipice, falling onto the rocks below with very messy results. Anyone hoping that this will herald a turning point in the film will be sorely disappointed: the dull drama continues, with an excess of singing, dancing and a glut of aerial overhead shots, with hints of weirdness to indicate where the film is heading (as if we didn't know already). As Christian's friends go missing one-by-one, and the locals become increasingly weird in their behaviour, neither he nor Dani question the wisdom of remaining in the village, both continuing to partake in the commune's activities. A bit of ritualistic sex and the sight of a bloke with his lungs pulled out of his back are about the film's only other noteworthy moments before the whole boring mess finishes in inevitable fashion, stealing its fiery climax from... you guessed it....

imdb_midsommar_thelittlesongbird_20231225,Midsommar,IMDb,TheLittleSongbird,2023-12-25,4,Didn't do it for me,"'Midsommar' (2019) Opening thoughts: It took me a long time to get round to watching 'Midsommar', due to not having time or the opportunity to watch it easily. Have always appreciated the genre it fits in, where there are many great films, and Florence Pugh showed a lot of promise seeing her for the first time in 'Little Women'. That it was also directed by the director responsible for the very good 'Hereditary' intrigued me too. The premise was one of those could have gone either way ones, it was advertised bizarrely and the critical reception was very polarising, particularly from those that didn't like it. After seeing 'Midsommar', count me in as somebody who didn't care for it. It is not an awful film and there are things done right, including an intriguing start, but the second half was a bizarre and tedious mess, so this viewer is this case more understanding of those who didn't like the film than liked. This has absolutely nothing to do with not understanding what 'Midsommar' was going to be or going for, quite the opposite, the issue is that it doesn't achieve its aims very well at all. Good things: 'Midsommar' does have good things. It is a very well made film visually, with photography that is both dreamlike and nightmarish in all the necessary places. The scenery is also absolutely beautiful, while also with a suitably ominous atmosphere. Did think too that the film started off well, with an unsettling opening that was creepy and suspenseful. The sacrifice scene was similarly suitably horrifying, with it being the scariest (and goriest) the film got. Regarding the acting, to me it was quite good considering what was given to them (which actually come to think of it wasn't much). Pugh anchors the film beautifully in a compellingly tortured lead performance. Bad things: However, there are also a lot of drawbacks. Most of the characters are incredibly thinly sketched and behave annoyingly and/or illogically. Pugh has the only character that has any development or who is interesting. Some friends thought that Will Poulter's character had the most personality, to me actually he was annoying and his presence jarred with the rest of the atmosphere. The direction did have some slickness but got very slack and muddled later on the more weird the second half became. The script has nothing memorable, is very stilted and can fall into self-indulgence. The story and pacing are the weakest aspects of 'Midsommar'. The story starts off with great atmosphere and intrigue, but post the sacrifice scene any creepiness and sense of horror pretty much completely goes. Meaning that the second half is incredibly long winded, this out increasingly (at times non-existent) and is bizarre to the point of near-incoherence. Especially the dragged out and truly daft climax that ends on an abrupt, incomplete feeling note and one of the silliest and most unintentionally funny sex scenes in recent years. Some of the intended creepy behaviours of the cult were potentially unnerving and sounded it on paper but were under-explored and/or left as loose ends or implied. A much shorter length definitely would have helped the pacing and atmosphere, the film is overlong and could have easily been trimmed by 25-30 minutes which would have tightened the pace. Which would have been achieved if scenes were made shorter and if motivations went into more detail. Closing thoughts: Overall, underwhelming. 4/10.",571,98,41,False

Bad: The film moves relatively at a great pace until near the 3rd act and then takes its time to craft its ending and at times dragged and started to get stale. There are so many clues/culture traditions learned through brief images of paintings and drawings in the community. Although this serves great for analysis and more viewings as a first watch it is a lot to comprehend and can be confusing near the end if you do not remember some of the drawings. It goes without saying that the characters do not make the smartest of decisions and there are quite a few horror cliches. Overall: The film triumphs in creating a beautiful yet disturbing atmosphere in broad daylight. There are powerful performances filled with emotions.

It's was a shocking film because it built up a certain momentum and although characters where clearly disturbed, we as an audience still felt empathy and tried to embrace their unorthodox approach to life. The final act of The Wicker Man is shocking and the last few scenes can really stir up some serious nausea. Midsommar tries to replicate that feeling of utter disarray but falls flat and becomes predictable. Character development could have been used more. I did enjoy one or two major scenes and I thought they really got the claustrophobic intensity down to a tee. Some scenes tried to pull off the shock factor but anyone watching will probably just think to laugh to throw off their awkwardness or people may just think it's just a tad bit silly over all.

I have a feeling this is what I'm going to come to realize from Midsommar. It was definitely insane with surreal imagery, but I honestly wish there was more backstory to Dani and her family; if there was more of a fleshed out concept about Dani and her family I feel like the movie would've have a more circular conclusion. But now knowing the kind of filmmaker Aster is shaping up to be, I don't think closure is what he aims for at all, leaving just enough to the imagination to push your buttons even further.

The cinematography is great, the acting is pretty good, and the story is captivating. I'm normally not a big fan of long movies, and in this case I even watched the director's cut that is 30 minutes longer, and never did I get a boring feeling. For that the story is too suspenseful, there is an evil dark ambiance to it that wants you to watch more. Movies about cults are most of the time interesting to watch as those people have a complete different lifestyle to ours, and mostly because they're deranged and/or brainwashed. Watching crazy people act weird, isn't that entertainment? To me it is for sure. Ari Aster did a very good job with this movie, that slow building tension all a long is brilliant.

It is not as deep as some make it out to be, one mustn't go in expecting it to have any more meaning than most other horror films. It is easy say that those who misunderstand the film are easy to indoctrinate into cults like the one shown in the movie, but it is more likely that the film has a very niche demographic and will only be appreciated by those with specific tastes. Its strongest strength is the direction, editing, and soundtrack. It is a very slowly paced kind of horror that operates on quiet psychological dread rather than jump scares or real horror. It is quite good at that, but also makes the film boring for many people. I think fans of movies like Perfect Blue and those who like to learn about cults will get the most enjoyment out of this movie. There is a common misconception that the ending of this movie is supposed to be a happy one, or that Dani has won in some way or made some feminist statement. Just because Dani is smiling does not make it a happy ending. Several people are burning to death in a cabin, that is not a good thing, even if her boyfriend was mean to her. She is in a cult, they are not her friends. She is fully indoctrinated by the end of the movie, she may feel as if she has found happiness, but this is not true. It is not a metaphor for grief, I don't think it's a metaphor for anything. The process where they break her down and build her up again and again is intentional, her smiling at any point does not mean she's found her family, it means the brainwashing is working. The smile at the end shows that the cult has won. Little reviews appreciate the indoctrination process shown in this movie. Lots of indoctrination techniques are shown that are not talked about. Many gloss over the way that Pelle lures Dani into the cult. He scouts out a vulnerable person, tries to break the relationship between her and Christian (even worse because Pelle is technically not wrong about him), and provides his cult village as the only family that will accept her. The way he tries to empathize with her struggle and offers her comfort just so that he can lead her into the cult is insidious.

They were happy that Dani finally got what she wanted, a family. In reality, the Hårga are a cult. Pelle chose Dani to be the new member because he knew that she had no family or friends who would investigate her disappearance and was desperate for a sense of belonging. It's funny how people are confident that they'd never get indoctrinated into a cult, yet these same people didn't see the Hårga as a cult. I'm like, ""of course you wouldn't get indoctrinated into a cult. You're not desperate enough."" People join cults when, like Dani, their lives are in shambles. They're poor/homeless, their family abandoned them, their family is dead, they don't have friends, they're sick, or they're having an existential crisis and are seeking guidance. Some people claim that the Hårga wasn't that bad because they showed Dani she'd be getting into. But, does she though? For example, of the Hårga's traditions is when their members reach the age of 72, they're no longer seen as being of use to the village and commit suicide by falling off a mountain. So, what happens when a member reaches 72, is perfectly healthy, and doesn't want to die? Do you think the cult is just gonna let them live and die of natural causes? No. They're either gonna force them off the mountain, sacrifices them, or exile them to the forest to fend for themselves. Since the Hårga live miles away from civilization and don't have phones or cell reception, no one can call for help. The Hårga, like all rural villages, believe in traditional gender roles. What happens when a female member is infertile or doesn't want to get pregnant? Or a male member doesn't want to work or becomes disabled? Cults are notorious for being ruthless to members who step out of line or can't contribute. We never see Hårga members getting punished or tortured for insubordination in the movie because they wanted to show Dani all their good sides. Do you think Pelle would've taken Dani to the village if it was raining or there wasn't a festival? No. He specially chose the perfect day to make the Hårga as appealing as possible. Dani is still trapped and will be forced to conform to their way of life, or else. People also say the Hårga is like paradise compared to mainstream American society because they could give Dani what she needed without technology. However, it wasn't modern society that caused Dani to be miserable, it was a combination of Christian's apathy and Dani's sister murdering her parents. We never know why she murdered her parents and killed herself. Was she mentally ill? We're Dani's parents abusing her? We don't know. Society also didn't make Dani introverted; that's just the way she is. If Christian were a better boyfriend, and Dani had better friends, Pelle wouldn't have targeted her for indoctrination. There's also been debate on whether or not the Hårga are a cult. They are, but not in the way we think of cults. They're similar to the Amish. They can claim to not be a cult since the members are allowed to leave. There's even a tradition called Rumspringa where Amish teens can choose to either stay or leave the village. The problem is both the Hårga and Amish's way of life is completely incompatible with the outside world. If any of them did leave, where could they go? They don't have driver's licenses, passports, dental records, social security codes, birth certificates, education records, or any form of official identification. As for work, the only thing they could do is low-skill factory work, be a maid/housekeeper, or a farmhand. People who were born and raised there are unlikely to leave because that would mean abandoning all their friends, family, and the only life they've ever known. Even though they're not technically hostages, their culture makes assimilation with the outside world is almost impossible. That's why a lot of them say, ""Why would I leave? I have everything I need."" This is why we see none of the Hårga leave, even though they could. That's why self-sustaining cults are dangerous.",707,31,20,True

Summer movies are traditionally tentpoles and teen flicks ... big budget action movies and those aimed at an audience that are on a 3 month reprieve from school. We are quickly learning that rising star filmmaker Ari Aster cares little for tradition. Well at least he seems to thrive on twisting tradition and spinning off in an unusual direction. His feature film debut was last year's mega-hit HEREDITARY, a horror film which was noted in most every critics association Top 10 list for 2018. HEREDITARY was filled with darkness and dread, and Mr. Aster's second film begins with a similar setting: it's a dark and cold night as Dani (Florence Pugh, LADY MACBETH) frantically searches for her bi-polar sister through emails and phone calls. During her search, we realize that her relationship with boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor, SING STREET) is a bit strained. The brilliant pre-credit sequence results in a horrific tragedy striking Dani's family. Christian does his best to offer support, but he's a typically weasel of a man who feels more at ease hanging out with his grad school buddies than providing love and compassion to his needy girlfriend ... and he's not man enough to tell her, despite the urging of his friends. An awkward group conversation leads Dani to accept an invitation to go on the boys' trip to Sweden. The purpose of the trip is twofold: to participate in a 9 day long village festival held every 90 years and for Josh (William Jackson Harper, ""The Good Place"") to work on his thesis. The other guys in the group are Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) whose family in Sweden is hosting the festival, and Mark (Will Poulter, THE REVENANT) who provides much of the comic relief thanks to his overall cluelessness about pretty much everything related to graceful societal interactions. And with that set-up comes one of the most deranged, unsettling and bizarre movie experiences this year (or most any year) is likely to bring. Try to picture a Folk Horror Comedy Fairy Tale Break-up Pagan Cult film, which at any given time reminds of MOTHER!, THE WICKER MAN, THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE VILLAGE, SUSPIRIA, and a handful of other cinematic oddities we've seen over the years. It is quite likely the sunniest horror film you've ever seen. And that's a literal description ... like the production could have been solar-powered. Most of it is filmed outside during Sweden's Midnight Sun - constant sunshine accompanied by mostly bright white skin and even brighter white cotton costumes (embroidered as if meant for Woodstock). The daylight messes with your senses and expectations. Bad things are supposed to happen in the dark, not in broad daylight enveloped by picturesque wonders of nature. Although the opening is cold, dark and punctuated with tragedy, the rest is so bright, it almost blinds you to the atrocities on screen. So without giving away anything, here's what we are in for: a welcome to Sweden mushroom trip, a Waco joke, a caged bear, a sacred tree, a Powerball game you hope to lose, and flowers and trees that seem to breathe. We also are reminded not to forget the birthday of our significant other, living to age 72 is not really rewarded in this commune, and no one should ever dance till they drop - even to be named the Queen of May. Of course, as with most horror films, it's easy to sit back as viewers and question the decision-making of the characters, but it's not like they realize they are in a horror film ... at least not until it's too late! Ms. Pugh (who reminds of another talented young actress, Haley Lu Richardson) is terrific here. Her character experiences shock, personal grief, a strained relationship, hallucinations, and a shot at revenge. The excellent music from Bobby Krlic, better known as The Haxan Cloak, is a mix of compositions and songs that create the mood for each character and scene. I was so shell-shocked at the end, that I'm unable to confirm that the version of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)"" is that of The Walker Brothers (Scott Walker died earlier this year) or that of another band. Director Aster's second film proves the exaggerated and diverse spectrum of what constitutes a horror film, and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski's disorienting camera work perfectly complements a rare cinematic blend of frightening and funny. The cheery faces and pastoral beauty very nearly distract us from what might be the ugliest break-up movie ever.",755,19,19,False

Most people who see this film will more than likely not understand what it's saying, which is fine. That's part of the beauty of cinema, it's subjective. And people are entitled to their own opinions. In my personal experience with this film, Midsommar effected me greatly. The first time I saw it I found it bizarre and grandiose, surreal and visceral. The kind of film that is saying something, but not so loudly that it overwhelms you with it's themes. In fact, it more so invites you to discover what it's saying. And it says a lot. I saw the film 3 times in theaters and I feel like I still haven't grasped entirely what the film means because much of it is very ambiguous. Ari Aster is smart in the regard that he knows what we don't see is much more terrifying than what we do. With that being said, I don't know if I would necessarily categorize this film as a horror movie. It's more of a psychological drama with elements of horror. But genre is merely a pigeonhole that we place films in based on how they make us feel. Regardless of genre, Mr. Aster has made a supremely effective look at a victim's complicated response to those who have hurt her. Visually, this film is a feast for the eyes. I don't think I've seen a better looking film in 2019 (besides The Lighthouse but in an entirely different fashion). It's use of color and lighting pretty much engulfs the viewer in this strange world that our protagonists have entered. It's some of the finest cinematography I've seen all year. The camerawork is very seamless and vast, as if painting a picture for us. Revealing things through use of imagery is no small task, but Aster and his cinematographer, Pawel Pogorzelski, pull this task off almost flawlessly (which is why I recommend multiple viewings of this film. It has a lot to say through its use of imagery. I'm sure there are some things I still haven't noticed and I've seen the film about 5 times now). This is awards-worthy work from this cinematographer, and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves. The costume and set design also thoroughly impress, with the small commune appearing to be a world uncorrupted by the outside. We're meant to be fascinated and fearful of this place and the design of the buildings and structures as well as the way they're presented evoke these responses effortlessly. It makes us wonder what's going on behind the walls of the sacred temples that appear so strange to us. The script for the film is also impressive, though I will say it is definitely not to the magnitude of what Aster did with Hereditary. But Hereditary is entirely different monster altogether. That film was what I would call claustrophobic. This film is vast and wide. Sparking our curiosity while also simultaneously alerting us that a certain danger lurks just beneath the bright exterior. One critic commented that this film is staged more like an opera than a horror film, and I wholeheartedly agree. This is a very well written film but instead of assaulting us with its themes it asks us to look for them ourselves. To interpret them in our own way, which is one of my favorite things about this film (though I can understand why some audiences will be turned off by this). Now let me get to my favorite aspect of any film: the acting. I'll start off first with the woman at the center of it all, Miss Florence Pugh. I've been watching her ever since I saw her impressive debut in 2016's Lady Macbeth, where she delivered one of the most unnerving performances I've ever seen given by an actress. Here she delivers one of the most vivid performances of the year. In every scene she's in in this film, she is open and vulnerable. As if she has no where that she can hide what she's feeling. And in a way, she doesn't. She's a fountain of emotion, sometimes bursting with an energy that fills the entire screen. It's a mesmerizing performance that allows her to put her full range on display. The supporting players are also very good, with Will Poulter in particular being a standout for providing much needed comic relief (making this film actually surprisingly hilarious at times). Jack Reynor also holds his own as the manipulative boyfriend who doesn't know when to leave well enough alone. Vilhelm Blomgren as their native Swedish friend, also impresses, his performance being sympathetic while also being entirely enigmatic. And William Jackson Harper (of Good Place fame) gives only what I can call a driven performance, advancing the plot towards the insane finale that we all know is coming. Some people have said that they have found the film tedious and with a few plot holes and I can see why. Some things are left ambiguous, but not outright unanswered. And I think that's the point. It's all part of what your interpretation is. Regardless of it's flaws, Midsommar is a complex study on grief and trauma. It will effect many viewers (some more than others), and will more than likely be a film that will be talked about years from now as a cinematic phenomenon that people will always be entranced by (similar to Kubrick's The Shining). And though it's not outright scary, it will unnerve you. Which is almost better than being scared.",937,40,30,False

When I saw the trailer, I thought ""This reminds me of The Wicker Man."" And I was right. If you are familiar with the original Wicker Man, this movie will not surprise you in the slightest. But is it any good? Well, it is beautifully photographed and there is some excellent sound design. There is a sense of creeping uneasiness, and some general nastiness here and there - it is a horror film, after all. The direction is sometimes very good, and sometimes a bit too much like showing off. And Florence Pugh is jaw-droppingly good. There is nothing by way of made-you-jump moments - not a bad thing, in my view. But there are a number of plot points which are inadequately dealt with which, to me, means they shouldn't have been there to start with - crass college pal Mark, for instance, whose attitude towards Dani has no payoff whatsoever. And this is particularly relevant given that this rather slight tale runs for 140 minutes. This tale unfolds at a pace which is a bit too leisurely. Losing half an hour would have improved the pace, losing an hour would have moved it along whip-fast. An excellent, and VERY disturbing final shot, though.",238,15,14,True

The psychedelic episodes were enough to give anyone who has experienced hallucinogenic drugs a flashback. Only criticism is, like most (if not all) films of this nature, it relies on characters making poor decisions in order to advance the plot.

In the film the shadows are very short, as corresponds to the sun being high-just one of many ""f... physics"" moments.

It's deep, detailed and a slow burn journey to a satisfying (yet haunting) finale. If, like me, you think the most horrifying thing in the world is mankind, then you'll love it! Midsommar draws its genre of a ""horror"" movie by highlighting the twisted, selfish, depravity of the human psyche. It depicts the absolute horrors we as mankind are capable of and not only choose, but religiously plan to execute for ""the greater good"". The most terrifying part? This type of story is based on historical fact! Ritualistic human sacrifices can be seen in ancient cultures all over the world from Pagan to Mayan. The script is limited, but I believe this is by choice. Sometimes actions speak louder than words; and sometimes the words left unspoken say the most.

imdb_midsommar_paulclaassen_20250613,Midsommar,IMDb,paulclaassen,2025-06-13,6,For a select audience.,"From the moment I started watching 'Midsommar' I kinda knew I would be dissatisfied with the ending. I just had a feeling. I was right. From the moment we meet our couple Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor) we sense something off in their relationship, and this is confirmed by Christian's friends Pelle, Josh and Mark wanting him to break up with her. But when Dani's sister gasses herself and her parents, Christian is there to comfort Dani. Without telling Dani, Christian and his friends planned to go to Sweden, but when she finds out, Christian invites her along, to the dismay of his friends. The uneasy feeling between Dani and the guys came across very strong, and effective. Pelle is member of a Pagan cult, and he wanted his friends to be part of a once in a lifetime experience: a 9-day midsummer feast that takes place once every 90 years. Arriving at Pelle's ancestral commune, it indeed seems like paradise at first, where one can be in harmony with nature. The film is very slow-paced as we explore the (weird) traditions of the cult, but I never found it boring. I believe the film is deliberately slow paced to create suspense. And just like that unexpected moment in 'Hereditary', director Ari Aster once again shocks us with a disturbing turn of events. There are a few graphic moments I never really expected. As the nature of the cult is slowly revealed, Dani and Christian's relationship is put to the test as their world becomes a living nightmare. (This is why I stay far away from any customs/traditions/rituals/cults...) I won't blame you for wanting to stop watching halfway through. I persevered purely out of curiosity, although in the back of my mind I had a feeling I wasn't going to like where this is going. Nope, I didn't. I was rooting for Dani almost throughout the movie, until I later rooted for Christian and ended up hating Dani. By the end I wished I'd never watched this. Still, 'Midsommar' is a very well made movie with good camerawork and an excellent performance by Florence Pugh as Dani. The film is atmospheric and foreboding, with a haunting score.

imdb_midsommar_cinemagoer77_20191124,Midsommar,IMDb,Cinemagoer77,2019-11-24,8,Excellent horror film about a cult,"This is generally a disturbing film. Some people say it was funny perhaps because they were uncomfortable with some scenes yet so many people were offended or hated it. So my guess is the movie made people uncomfortable. Again, it was a disturbing film which many horror films are not these days. I welcomed Ari's latest effort as horror is becoming non-horrific lately with so many tropes that the genre is lacking these days. The 1 star reviewers ignore the story telling, ignore any of the characters, ignore the symbolism that exists through the entire story, and ignore the creepiness of some of the sociopathic members. You should rewatch it just to see how evil their foreign friend actually is. It is atleast a 4 or 5 star minimum. I say this is a thinkers horror film because i had to rewatch twice. Although the movie is gory it doesn't glorify the actions of the cult members. You get the feeling the cults are indeed the abnormalities we know they are and it's a visceral feeling to see them carry out their rituals. Cults can be argued as the anti-thesis of progress/freedom and how they possess the means to attract people is just as baffling. Well Midsommar offered a glimpse into the cult via codependency and loss. Add in charming sociopathy who tell people what they like to hear and we have some poor people who get lead into horror and loss of freedom/love. As a cult film this is atleast 8. Also, The wicker man comparisons need to stop. How many posession movies are there and how many times need they be compared? Cult horror is a sub-genre like zombie films are also a sub-genre. This is an excellent film about the horrors of a cult for modern times. I really think Ari is becoming a true master of horror. He leaves many viewers disturbed but also with warnings and lessons about what evil really is. He does not glorify horror..rather he reveals consequences..8 out of 10 for me..",340,20,13,False

Unfortunately, by the end of the film it was a slog to get through. Let me also add that if you liked ""Mandy"" you will probably love this film. The start of the film was very promising, and in true fashion, the dialog, performances and camera work were exceptional. The opening lasts approximately 30 minutes and sets up the concept of the film, this is usually the hardest part for a horror (not really sure what category to put this film in as it is unique) film to do well, and I think Midsommar does a pretty good job. The mid-section is very slow and does a phenomenal job at building anticipation. Many will hate how slow it is, and others will appreciate it. There are sequences that show the hallucinogenic effects of drugs (imho) the most accurately to date. So why did I give this film a 6/10? Where do I think it went wrong? Well, I don't believe it did go ""wrong"" as such, rather it just stayed at the same level, and the ending felt like a disappointment. It was incredibly clear (intentionally) where the story was going, so the fact it took so long to get there, and only there was a let down. Best things about Midsommar. Camera work Authentic, immersive writing & acting (Florence Pugh was excellent) Accurate drug simulation. Cons. Slow pace without a crescendo. Lack of character development.

It's a movie going experience that is very difficult to describe. Ari Aster film delivers on being very disturbing and gruesome but suffers from major pacing issues. The good: the cinematography, acting, colors and music are nearly flawless. It is one of the most technically stunning films you will see. The music makes the film all the more unsettling at times and the camera shots can linger for so long it begins to make you nervous. The acting is solid specifically from Pugh. Will Poulter is funny at times and intentionally annoying as almost all his characters are. If you were expecting hereditary part 2, you may want to reconsider. While this film just gets crazier and crazier as it goes, it can be hard to forget that this story is Dani's and that's where you will find what this movie is truly about. It's about an unstable relationship that decays and eventually explodes and forces a new cycle of self-discovery. You will probably need to read articles or watch videos on this movie when you come out like I did. Now on to the issues. This movie is long. And I enjoy long movies. Hereditary was perfectly paced but there are numerous scenes in this movie that could be trimmed down or cut. People will say it adds to the movie as a whole but some don't. Also, there are supposed to be some genuinely unsettling scenes but almost everyone in the theater burst out laughing. Nudity can be a hard thing to take seriously when it's showed like this, but I understand that some pagan rituals actually do that, so i understand where it's coming from. While the climax is far from as unforgettable as hereditary, the story does come full circle and will leave you with an unsettling final shot. Overall, Aster's sophomore film doesn't reach the heights of hereditary, but still provides much of what people loved about that movie. You will most likely walk out of the theater thinking wtf did I just watch, but that's the point. It's a film that requires multiple viewings and some research to truly appreciate.

I love the theme of shared energy and/or the collective consciousness. The entire group caterwauling with the protagonist, conveying the emotions of an individual made perfect sense in a very unsettling way. The Wicker Man did most of this stuff better. The WTF elements are definitely an amplified version, throughout, but it still has that ""been done before"" vibe. It's like combining The Wicker Man and The Shining and adding some relatively intriguing variations and some decent effects. It's not 100% original in content, but the execution is superb. Well shot, (relatively) well acted (there are some moments that I didn't buy), well choreographed, dreadful, hard to watch; It runs the gamut, but, again, it's been done before... and better. I'm sorry. I am not discrediting the artistry of Ari Aster; he definitely knows what he wants to do, but I don't think he knows quite how to make it 100% unique. People can say what they want about Darren Aronofski, but that dude has been firing on all cylinders since jump street (Pi). Ari Aster is definitely someone to watch, but I think he needs to establish a better voice for himself.

imdb_midsommar_dwightlynn_20200113,Midsommar,IMDb,DwightLynn,2020-01-13,7,A Powerful and Bizarre Ride,"After the powerhouse that was Hereditary, I was eager to see how writer-director, Ari Aster, would follow up his amazing debut. Midsommar is an ambitious second film that carries over some of what worked with his initial film while having a different feel overall. Like Hereditary, this film is carried by a wonderful lead actress who goes through an entire cavalcade of emotion. Florence Pugh was an actress I was unaware of, but following this film I am definitely going to keep my eye out for her. She was jaw-dropping. She conveyed grief and sadness so vigorously it almost became hard to watch. One thing that was interesting about this film is that unlike Hereditary, which was unpredictable the entire way through, in this film the outcome is fairly apparent. It is a horror movie about a bunch of people visiting a strange place; you kinda know what is going to happen to them. But what kept my interest, aside from the great presentation, is how Aster presents his characters. They are believable. Especially the boyfriend character. They aren't over-the-top; they are real people. And that makes what happens to them all the more heartbreaking. Aster really likes to put his characters through the ringer emotionally. There are moments in this film where his characters are so emotionally-devastated part of you just wants to reach into the screen and put your hand on their shoulder. The presentation of the film is notable as well. What stuck out to me is the amazing cinematography, score, and lighting. Having a horror movie set during the day is a unique decision and it benefited the film greatly. There are so many breathtaking shots in this film that it almost becomes more mesmerizing than scary. Midsommar lures you in slowly and looks innocent at first, much like the cult of this film. If I had any complaints it would be about the last 20 minutes or so. As mentioned previously, the plot is somewhat predictable, and that is fine for a movie like this because if anything, this just increases the dread the audience feels for the characters. The problem I had with the last little chunk of the film is that the two remaining characters left were both rendered mute. This was a good way to get the audience to focus on the creepy visuals, but with completely silent protagonists it becomes kind of hard to relate to what is happening on screen. The characters are written so well that when they no longer speak I feel left in the dark. And since the plot is kind of predictable, the ending feels a little too slow for me. I think Aster could have achieved the same feeling in the end if the pacing was a bit quicker. This is another complaint I have: the movie may be a little too long for its own good. Hereditary had such a breakneck pace that this may be jarring to some. Still, what makes this film compelling is its characters and the journey they go on. Aster is a king at mixing relationship drama with disturbing ideas and images. His films really stick with you more than most horror films because of this, and I am very eager to see what messed up thing he cooks up next.

There are too many brilliant horror films that have pushed (or exceeded) that 2 hour mark so I can't say that's a wise barometer of a film's quality. However, Midsommar could stand a few trims here and there to tighten things up. The issue with Midsommar is this - we've all seen movies like this before. We know what's going to happen, yet the characters don't, so we spend an awfully long time waiting for the inevitable as we have to see ancient cult rituals carried out in real time. It can make for an exhausting watch. It's not the story that Midsommar is telling that's interesting, but the way that it's telling it. With its focus on a toxic relationship between Dani and Christian, it colors a familiar story with something altogether different and unique. When Midsommar really hits its stride, though, it's off and running and better than just about any other horror film in recent memory.

Ari Aster himself said it was an ""operatic break up movie"" and that is a perfect description. Through her personal tragedies, Dani finds meaning and community again - she finds people to hold her, to cry with her - things she should have had all along. The cult setting is clever - it's ritualistic shock and gore at every step, seeming to underline Dani's heightened sense of foreboding and horror and her struggle to process the tragedy with her family and with Christian. But by the end of the movie, Dani embraces the ritualized gore and sees it's necessary for moving on (in more than just one sense). The cult has shown her how to cope and given her a community to do so. Their tragedies are planned and measured; they have responsibility for their own traumas. It's pure art.

If anything, it showed that Ari Aster was a force on his directorial debut. We all wondered what as next. Midsommar quickly became my most hyped film of the summer and I vowed to see it as soon as it comes out. Midsommar is exactly what I wanted it to be and more. This will be a polarizing film, I feel but I already know that I want to rewatch it because it is truly a mesmerizing experience. The film is about a group of friends who travel to Sweden for a celebration that occurs every 90 years. The protagonist (played by Florence Pugh), recently experienced a traumatic loss and goes on this trip with her boyfriend in hopes of repairing their very distant relationship. Everything seems beautiful and serene at first but the group soon realize that this festival is not normal at all and the bizarre cult-like events are actually a lot more dangerous than they seem. Ari Aster shows that he is already an expert in filmmaking. This film is a very loose horror as a lot of it is comedic, abstract, visual, and more unsettling than scary. Its perfect that way and shows the range Aster has. The lighting, setting, and cinematography in this film are absolutely stellar. It is an absolutely beautiful looking picture. Someone else who really shows range is Florence Pugh. From playing Lady Macbeth, to a WWE wrestler, to a girl going through an absolutely traumatic experience. A lot of this film is humorous. Its hard not to burst out laughing at the uncomfortably bizarre sequence of events in this film. The pagan like rituals in this film are just so engorging to behold and you just want to know more and more at the mythos behind this cult. The film is so unique in its nature but the creativity and imagery flow through, much like with Hereditary. This is pure unhinged ambition from Aster. He takes the reigns off from what he did with Hereditary and explores a beautifully terrifying event with people who are darker than they seem. The film is a slow burn but its fun to just stare at every frame and behold the transpiring of absolute madness. Its an absolute psychedelic trip from start to finish.

Directed by Ari Aster, this horror film showcases a series of unsettling scenes as the characters navigate the unnerving events unfolding around them, making you constantly question yourself whether everything that is happening in the film is real or everyone's just high on drugs. The movie delves into the complex dynamics of a deteriorating relationship, with Christian being the absolute worst boyfriend that could ever exist while Dani having personal issues that hunts her every now and then. It becomes evident that Dani's efforts to salvage their relationship are in stark contrast to Christian's desire to escape. His true motivation for going to Sweden appears to be a means of distancing himself from their troubled relationship. This film effectively juxtaposes an aesthetically pleasing visual landscape with the terrifying depths that lie beneath. The movie presents itself as a fresh and invigorating experience, while simultaneously revealing the hidden horrors within the seemingly idyllic setting of a Swedish commune. Florence Pugh delivers an exceptional performance as Dani, skillfully portraying her complex range of emotions and the overall essence of her character. It is disheartening to witness Dani's struggle to process her feelings in a healthy manner, as she is surrounded by individuals who manipulate and gaslight her, convincing her that her emotions are a result of her family's tragic past rather than the eerie customs of the commune. At its core, Midsommar is a gore-infused movie masked by its visually pleasing scenery. The film explores the belief held by the commune that life follows a cyclical pattern, which ends at the age of 72 or, as the lady explains, when they ""end their Harga."" This concept adds an unsettling layer to the narrative, heightening the tension and fear experienced by the characters. Midsommar is a haunting and thought-provoking film that explores themes of manipulation, toxic relationships, and the dark underbelly of seemingly peaceful communities.

I recommend you watch ""The Wicker Man"" from 1973, Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""The Holy Mountain"" and Sergei Parajanov's ""The Color of Pomegranates"" before you watch this watered down, pretentious murk in order to get a sense of how movies can truly be mind-altering. The ""story"" is essentially every cliché of the slasher genre mashed together: a group of young people naively go into the wilderness (Sweden, very scary place lol) and encounter messed up stuff. They each die one by one and, SPOILER ALERT, there is a ""final girl"" who survives in the end. The rest of this cliché story is fluff. If you think, based on the trailer, that much of this film will mirror the original Wicker Man, you are exactly right. There is even a big fire at the end where a guy gets burned alive. There is a fine line between homage and rip-off and this may a great example of a film that slips over the edge into complete rip-off territory. I won't even go into all the logical loopholes in the story and the scenario, or point out that none of the customs line up at all with ancient Scandinavian rituals (thus making one wonder why this even takes place in Sweden to begin with, like, why couldn't this be a cult in upstate NY?) because there's no point. The script doesn't even attempt to be deep, the research here is sub-Wikepedia level, and the characters are cookie-cutter types you've seen before in a million other horror movies. One logical question I would ask, however, is how come all of these people are anthropology PhD students going to research Scandinavian paganism but none of them speak Swedish??!?!? Has the writer ever even talked to someone with a PhD??? All this said, Florence Pugh is a talented actress and does a great job with the shallow script. She transcends the material and shows that she can be a powerful dramatic actress. The cinematography is gorgeous too. The editing and sound are pitch perfect. I was especially taken by the set design, the use of furniture and quirky wall paintings to give the film a sense of intricate beauty to contrast with the horror. This is all really fabulous and the people who worked on these aspects of the film should be commended. It is all cosmetic, however. Without the mask of beautiful production and a gifted actress, the director/ writer Aster has absolutely nothing going on here. ""Hereditary"" was a very good, solid horror film and I wonder if Aster didn't rush into this sophomore effort too soon. This seems like a script he could have banged out in a night, especially since it feels like something made out of other films. It also seems that Aster repeats some of the same tricks from ""Hereditary""- using shocking, Gaspar Noé-like violence and relying on making his audience feel uncomfortable at the sight of incongruously naked people running around. These stock images are going to get old really fast for him, he needs to work on building up to scares that really pay off. There will be people who love this director, who are swept away by the cool style and photography of this film or who have simply never seen any of the hundreds of other movies out there with strange imagery and creepy paganism, and these people are going to think this movie is a mind-blower.

That gives the horror a base, a backstory that makes the overall story a little better than say, Hereditary, which just sort of dumped a supernatural explanation on the audience at the end. The psychopathic disregard for outsiders is the main horror feature. Real insular communities are said to bring in strangers for the DNA diversity for breeding so that part is realistic. The end of life ritual is interesting and not unrealistic considering cultures that starve out elders in times of hardship. This was just a step further. The rest of the treatment of outsiders wasn't really explained or of some obvious value to the community. The human vivisection in the chicken coop suggested the person was still alive and several visitors just disappeared with just a flimsy excuse to the remaining.

The film follows a group of friends who travel to a remote Swedish village to attend a midsummer festival, only to find themselves trapped in a nightmarish and increasingly violent ritual. One of the most striking aspects of ""Midsommar"" is its visual presentation. The film is beautifully shot, with lush cinematography that captures the eerie beauty of the Swedish countryside and the vivid rituals of the cult. The use of light and color is particularly effective, creating a sense of unease and otherworldliness that permeates the entire film. The performances in ""Midsommar"" are also exceptional. Florence Pugh delivers a standout performance as the grief-stricken protagonist, Dani, effectively conveying her character's complex emotions and inner turmoil. Jack Reynor also impresses as Dani's emotionally distant boyfriend, Christian, bringing depth to a character who could easily have been one-dimensional. Another positive aspect of ""Midsommar"" is its exploration of complex themes such as grief, trauma, and the nature of relationships. The film delves into the darker aspects of human nature, challenging the audience to confront uncomfortable truths about themselves and society as a whole. However, ""Midsommar"" is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find the film's slow pacing and deliberate, almost dreamlike narrative style off-putting.

If you prefer horror that spoon-feeds you an abundance of the unnatural and grotesque, then you'll be better served by other films. Midsommar is a powerhouse of unsettling storytelling. In a genre that relies on pitch black rooms and camera angles that obscure the jump scare coming around the corner, it instead thrusts the entire movie into bright sunlight. It doesn't need an unending stream of unexpected scares, because seeing them coming from a mile away actually works *better* and forces the viewer to sit helpless as they know (at least part of) what's coming. In a movie so intentionally contradictory, the moments lacking ambiguity feel obviously deceitful and put us on edge for the fate of the characters. As others have mentioned, the cinematography is outstanding. Dialogue feels very grounded, and the performances of the leads, especially Florence Pugh, are excellent. In addition, MY GOD the soundtrack - The Haxan Cloak (Bobby Krlic) deserves all the praise for his mix of atmospheric pieces mixed with bright, cheerful pieces when appropriate. This is not an obvious film. It treats its audience with respect and puts things in plain view while hiding its lies in plain sight.

It's pretty much a rip off of The Wicker Man but has it's Ari Aster signature look and camera movements. The negatives: The film could've been cut down alot. None of the characters are likable. The opening is a gimmick to try and side with Pugh. Pugh just mopes around crying the entire film. The ending is beyond predictable. Most of the graphic content is there for pure shock value. The boyfriend runs around naked for a while near the end just to put male nudity in it. The boyfriend character you're supposed to hate immediately, you end up rooting for him at the end because of how absurd everyone and the cult is and he is not at all even close to absurd and crazy as the cult. What Aster preaches in the movie is shoved down your throat. The fact these 'kids' go to this weird place and then stay when they see what they are walking into doesn't make any sense at all. Positives: The Wicker Man had a very interesting concept and story and it follows in this film but not nearly as good as The Wicker Man. It's alot flashier. The cinematography is really good. The set and art direction is really good. The gore is good if you're into that. It's colorful. Keeps the trend of A24 style horror films. I don't want to be preached to and Aster does it in all his films. He tries messing with taboo subjects and then shoves it down your throat. But overall this is a decent weird horror film.

Having watched this film, I find myself caught between admiration for its craft and discomfort from its thematic explorations. The movie follows a young American couple, Dani and Christian, whose relationship is on the brink of collapse. They, along with their friends, are invited to a midsummer festival in a remote Swedish village, which at first appears to be a peaceful and idyllic retreat. However, as the festival progresses, the community's ancient traditions reveal themselves to be disturbing and violently perverse. One of the film's strongest points is its use of broad daylight to evoke horror. Unlike traditional horror films that rely on darkness to create suspense, ""Midsommar"" proves that the light of day can be equally, if not more, terrifying. The cinematography is breathtaking, offering visuals that are both dreamlike and nightmarish. The juxtaposition of the film's beautiful scenery with its horrifying events enhances the sense of unease and dread. The performances, particularly Florence Pugh's portrayal of Dani, are exceptional. Pugh captures the complexity of her character's emotional journey with profound depth, making the audience's investment in her fate all the more intense. The film's exploration of grief, relationships, and the human desire for belonging is compelling and thought-provoking. However, ""Midsommar"" is not without its weaknesses. Its deliberate pacing and lengthy runtime may test the patience of some viewers, particularly those accustomed to more conventional horror fare. Additionally, while the film's climax is visually spectacular and thematically fitting, some may find it over-the-top or even absurd, detracting from the otherwise meticulously built tension. Ari Aster's willingness to subvert genre expectations and explore horror through a unique lens is admirable, making ""Midsommar"" a standout film. It's a divisive piece of cinema-some may find it a masterpiece of modern horror, while others might see it as pretentious or unnecessarily grotesque. Regardless, ""Midsommar"" is an unforgettable experience that pushes the boundaries of the horror genre, inviting viewers to bask in its daylight nightmare. In conclusion, ""Midsommar"" is a film that excels in its visual storytelling, strong performances, and its audacious reimagining of horror. Its slow burn and thematic density might not cater to everyone's tastes, but for those willing to embrace its peculiarities, it offers a richly rewarding cinematic experience.",405,3,1,False

I like almost any movie, even the ones that are not really great... But this is the kind of nonsense movie where everything is absurd, from the script to the characters, situations... Nothing left to like. It's sopposed to be a 'psicological terryfing thriller' or something like that, but it's more like psicological nonsense, high on drugs and cults or something like that without telling any story. Characters didn't have a motivation for anything, so what the hell, let's strech it to 2 and a half hours. Come on! All of the people who enjoy the film praise it for the cinematography, which was uninspired, for it's breaching of multiple genres, which was done but rather poorly, and for being about the breakup, not just the horror, which, it was, but had a ridiculous stance on the break up. The positives in the film were the acting and the FX department. I wish I could give credit to the production designer but putting the tune for sacrifice on the sacrificial character's costume isn't clever, it's tacky. It's like having a name tag saying ""Hi, my name is Murderer"" in a slasher film. The lighting decision to have a horror film be in broad daylight is neither original (Wicker Man) nor well done (it is very straightforward camera angles other than a singular upside down windshield shot). The breaching of multiple genres is a good thing and could be praised, if it was done in a way that complimented the strengths of the genres involved and conveyed the message. Neither of these happened. Instead, random lines of humor were included interspersed between gratuitously graphic on screen killings. Then there were completley purposeless orgy sequences with explicit nudity that I have read were included as comic relief according to the director. How is disgusting nudity of about 15 elderly women for a full minute on screen funny? Are you trying to shock us into laughter because we have no other way to respond to something so depraved? And if it wasn't meant for comedy (even though Aster publicly said it was) then what could have been the purpose when the same plot point could have been covered by them being clothed onlookers? The perversion and level of gratuitous filth in this movie were terrible, but the fact that they didn't even progress the story or theme was what was the most disturbing part. It wasn't even for something valuable to the production. Lastly, this whole 'its really a break up movie' gimmick could have been okay, if you weren't asking us to side with the girl who murdered her partner of 3 and a half years instead of a cult member who has killed all of her friends. And what was the boyfriend's crime? Wanting out of a relationship that was toxic, but waiting to break up because the girls entire family just died? I get that he is a jerk about the thesis thing, but in terms of the relationship, he was beyond supportive. She was the one who cheated with the swedish friend first and who accused him of forgetting her birthday, which, he actually didn't do. So what exactly is Aster wanting us to enjoy about his take on the break up where the 'heroine' murdered the one person who didn't think he should break up with her right after she lost three family members? Beyond all of that, the movie was underwhelming in terms of scares or terror. It was neither a thriller nor a collection of jump scares or chase scenes. Now those have been done to death (pun intended) by the horror genre, but what was scary in this movie? The people killing themselves of their own volition? The off screen disappearances? I was disgusted by the depravity of this film and entirely disappointed in it's lack of any statement about the views or choices of the characters or situation. It was a movie with plot points and then it ended. Worst movie!!",675,31,14,True

But extreme wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for truly different. Truly scary. This movie wasn't scary it was just disturbing. There were ugly nude bodies, some gore, and overall disturbing ceremonies but it was still a pagan ritual movie. But it was also slow. Exasperatingly slow. Slower than a constipated sloth. There were too many silent mood-setting shots. I've been programmed to know that silent shots in scary movies are for build-up. It's upon the movie maker to deliver on that build up. I can't count how many slow-moving shots in this movie were building up to nothing. I get it. You can't have something ghastly happen every time or it will become mundane. But not at all? When these five friends went to Sweden for a getaway and decided to stop off in some remote village for their nine-day festival you knew something was gonna go down.

The film presents a problem, its script, which does not know where to focus or even what to tell, with a course of the lost plot, not knowing where to walk and poor plot and rhythm choices, a completely unnecessary first act that could have solved in 5 minutes, leaving for the ""main plot"", although this does not seem to exist here, a attention deficit counted on not knowing where to focus and diverse are the characters without narrative function, not to mention the various arcs and cores that are open and never completed, this may even be purposeful and work in many movies, but it doesn't work here. If the script presents problems, technically the film is exquisite, with a contrast to the usual horror photography, very clear and beautiful, an amazing scenery composition and great costumes, the art direction deserves merit here, from the make-up. even the choreography is spectacular in many ways, even the sound mixing is great, just like the soundtrack that blends a modern and classic rhythm. Ari Aster has a meritorious direction, the director directs his film well, he knows how to create the mood and the tension well, with a camera that can be caustrophobic even with open angles and great cuts, dry and vicerais, besides the already commenting and wonderful scenery composition, but the script's attention deficit slips a little in the direction as well, as the director gets lost in his own created world and gets very excited with the camera in hand, there are many unnecessary contemplations and techniques that do not In keeping with the rest of the film, Ari had some great ideas for his second film, but he had a lot of execution problems, it is undeniable that the young director has talent, but his excitement in wanting to demonstrate this ends up damaging his film. The Cast is very good, although some characters have no narrative function, the actors play their roles, even Will Poulter as comic relief is fine, not to mention all the scary and great members of the Swedish village, but the big highlight really stands for Florence, the little-known British actress gives a show of her own and gives herself completely to her role, ranging from despair to drama, to fear and acceptance. Ari's second film has several merits, but it also has problems, mainly of execution and lack of clarity in its focus, sometimes in the direction, but mainly in the script, with an unnecessary first act and a script that cannot decide which story tell, but we have a dazzling art direction and a direction that, despite the detours, is extremely uncomfortable, often causing nuisance, which is good for a horror movie. The goal of being daunting in daylight works primarily at the beginning, once we get used to it it loses strength. ""Midssomar"" is being loved or hated, I think it's a good movie, nothing more than that, but if I had to choose between loving and hating, I'd rather love. It is also important for the viewer to embark on the long wave to feel its tension and despair, otherwise it will be a long, boring and tiring trip. Rating: 7.5",572,6,5,False

Visual Brilliance: ""Midsommar"" is a visual feast that immerses the audience in the surreal and otherworldly atmosphere of a Swedish midsummer festival. The film's cinematography, led by Pawel Pogorzelski, is nothing short of spectacular. The breathtaking shots of the idyllic Scandinavian landscapes, coupled with the meticulous attention to detail in the festival rituals, create a hauntingly beautiful and immersive world that is both alluring and disconcerting. Intricate Sequence Plans: Aster demonstrates a keen eye for detail in the film's sequence plans, utilizing long takes to build tension and capture the unfolding horror.

Aster skillfully weaves a tale that is both horrifying and thought-provoking, employing symbolism and allegory to enhance the layers of the story. The gradual unraveling of the characters and the escalating tension create an unsettling atmosphere that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats until the final frame.

imdb_midsommar_mike_devine_20200131,Midsommar,IMDb,Mike_Devine,2020-01-31,7,The kind of horror that gives your mind a workout,"On the heels of the deeply disturbing 'Hereditary,' Ari Aster returns with the equally unsettling Nordic nightmare that is 2019's 'Midsommar.' Graphic. Gruesome. Trippy. Twisted. All adjectives that can be used to describe this film. The events that unfold throughout can be interpreted in many different ways, but at the center of everything is a fractured relationship between the two young American twentysomethings - Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor). Unfortunately, the fragile bond that ties them together is not much of a match for the centuries-old barbaric rituals that take place during their summer adventure in a remote village in northern Sweden. Seeing how the relationship between Dani and Christian weathers the storm during their stay on this compound is something that doesn't really register until after the credits roll. 'Midsommar' messes with your mind and makes you question how things got to the way they end up. How much of the storyline is impacted by outside factors, and how much of it originates from within? This is a question that is up for much debate. But among the drug-fueled highs and the depressing lows of 'Midsommar' is the frighteningly beautiful fantasyland in which the film is set. The natural wonder of the Swedish (or Utahan) landscape sets an incredibly stark contrast from the horrors carried out by those who inhabit the area, and the incredible cinematography warps things even further. Maybe it's the midnight sun, maybe it's the use of color. Perhaps it's the use of sound (or lack thereof). Whatever it is, it reaches out and grabs you, and doesn't let go. Before you are finally able to move on from the final 15 minutes of 'Midsommar,' you wonder why you just sat through it. But the more you think about it, the more you recognize the metaphors and themes woven into the script, the use of foreshadowing and visual cues. The film is heavy, yes, but in a weird way it's like abstract art. Some love it, many hate it, and others are still trying to figure it out.",344,6,5,False

They're almost all worth watching if in the mood, but the lack of stillness in the camera, the constant cuts, quick quips, punchathons and artificial visuals get tiring after a while. Midsommar is a fine antidote: the camera is beautifully still or slow. Editing-cuts are far less frequent, allowing more time to sink into an image. The compositioning of images is masterful: photography-like. Indeed, Kubrick-like (who was initially a photographer). We also get an impactful soundtrack, excellent acting especially from the lead, good script & screenplay with plenty of quality dialogue-free sections, effectively spare FX with realistic psychedelic 'breathing' visuals, and a riveting foreboding atmosphere. There's also very weird humour, which actually made me & my lady laugh out loud a few times....tho' I imagine others might just find it weird. The film slightly drags in the final third (I watched the theatrical cut) and some of the character reactions will have you questioning its realism. The plot itself is fairly predictable...we've seen such films before. These are nitpicks as we also get a handful of strong memorable scenes.

If it's a story that needs to be told in over 2 hours, I'm all for it. Unfortunately, Midsommar is under the impression that it has a bigger, deeper story to tell that it really does and that hurts the film. The odds are, if you've seen more than a handful of horror movies in your day, you'll know where Midsommar is going within the first 30 minutes of the movie. Granted, this isn't always a bad thing. Entire franchises (such as the Friday the 13th series) have been founded on the principal of ""let's give them what they expect with a little something different."" The difference is - these movies know they're not exactly high art and keep things short and sweet before the audience has the chance to catch on that what they're offering up isn't anything terribly new or interesting. Midsommar starts off well with a solid 1st act in which Dani (a terrific Florence Pugh) still grieving over an incident that robbed her of her entire family. She weasels her way into a Sweden trip with her boyfriend, Christian, and his friends so that they can check out a strange cult-y commune. Once they arrive, they start to get the feeling that things aren't quite right with the people there. Well, I shouldn't say it happens immediately. In Midsommar's most drawn out act, the audience catches on that this cult is iffy as the lead characters take another 40/50 minutes to figure it out. That said, once the film really gets going, it's great, but it seems like so much time is wasted on silly things (who cares if two friends are trying to do a thesis on the same subject and why do we need to see every single cult ritual in full?) Ari Aster still has a knack for creating unbearably dark, depressing, and dread-filled horror out of thin air and it's a genuine gift. Hereditary at least had it's old dark house to generate tension, but Midsommar is perhaps the brightest film of the year, so there's nowhere for the terror to hide. In some ways, it's an even greater feat that he managed to create so much apprehension out of otherwise beautiful, scenic views. All in all, it's an interesting, if frustrating viewing experience.

imdb_midsommar_horst_in_translation_20200619,Midsommar,IMDb,Horst_In_Translation,2020-06-19,6,"Pretty strange film, but this is exactly what made it worth watching","After about five very prolific years of making short films, writer and director Ari Aster made his first full feature film not too long ago and ""Hereditary"" was a huge success. Now here we have his second full feature movie and while the first had major supernatural horror elements, this one here does not. Or well, it does in the minds of many characters and their deeds to serve their highers, but this is of course just theoretical. It is a horror film, however, there is no denying. Even when we are not yet in Sweden, the circumstances of the female protagonist's sister's death are as dubious as it gets and there is also a shockingly graphic image of that. But the vast majority of the film is set in Sweden, so it should be no surprise to anybody that this is a Swedish co-production and that there are many Swedish cast members, especially with this title. It's probably most effective to watch this film on a really hot summer day outside, but I only got half of that last night when I watched it as my second post-Corona movie at a(n outdoor) cinema. The weather was not so nice the way it was a few days earlier. But it's alright. By the way, this is a really, really long film at almost 2.5 hours and the one big name attached to this project is Florence Pugh. Well, the biggest name I should say. 2019 was an amazing year for her scoring her first Oscar nomination for ""Little Women"" and actually I am a bit surprised to see her in this film here. I would have imagined Alicia Vikander or so. Anyway, I think she does a fine job and she is also pretty stunning fur sure. I am growing into a bit of a fan I think. Also really liked her on ""Little Women"" and she was maybe the best thing there. But back to this film: The only other cast member I am familiar with here is Will Poulter and he is always easy to identify. I remember him very well from Bigelow's ""Detroit"" and he was amazing there, so I hope his career will rise in the coming years. His character here feels almost a bit too small given the actor's talent. He is mostly in it for comedic reasons. Be it his comments when everybody is stoned, how he regrets having missed some of the action, how he is delighted to be led away by the Swedish girl (while he has no clue what's waiting for him) or of course how he pees against that ancient tree trunk. His normal simple man character you could say went very much against conventions, especially in that secret society there. He was a riot at times. I must say nonetheless that I had no clue what eventually happened to him. It was him smacking down the Black dude when the latter went for the bible right? Was he also under some special drug? He was alive still in any case. Well, somewhat alive. These drugs are a big thing in this movie and the joints the group is smoking early on are definitely as harmless as it gets with what else is waiting for them later on. Just take a look at the protagonist's boyfriend near the end and the drink he is offered and reluctantly drinks and then this sex orgy starts. Now that was maybe the most bizarre moment of the entire movie. Not the act per se as you could see that coming with how the ginger girl is mentioned several times (although I did not think that it could be her pube there), but all the other women in this specific scene and how they interact with the girl (the weird singing next to her head) and also how the old lady slaps the dude's butt. What the heck? And of course, how ginger girl says right away she can feel the baby. So yeah, like I said it's all the awkward, bizarre and weird elements from this movie that turn it into something slightly fascinating. Not always fascinating as you can see from my rating. Another example would be the comment about how all the tribe's (let's call them that) oracles are the result of inbreeding. Very messed up. This specific scene shows nonetheless that while they try to seem harmless to others, it is all part of a plan. At the exact same time, we have a member of the tribe tell the American characters that there is no coordinated big-scale inbreeding. So things are clearly not even close to what they seem here. It reminded me a bit of ""Get Out"" in terms of the overall scenario. And the characters here sure needed to get out as well. Also how two characters have the intention to write their thesis on this tribe and the elders reluctantly agree under certain conditions, but they only did so to keep the guys there because they knew they will probably never get out to release their thesis or tell anybody about this tribe. As for Christian (played by Jack Reynor), Pugh's character's boyfriend, I always somehow felt he could also be in on the entire project that there is something evil going on, especially how he reacted to the double suicide ritual (man, some nasty shots there from Aster, definitely nothing for young audiences), but looking at what happened to him at the end, he probably wasn't in at all. The only one really in on everything was the Swedish buddy who led them there and his talking to Pugh's character especially already implied that maybe he appreciated her more than he should have. It's alright though. I still wonder why. I mean he could not know that she would become the new May Queen. Probably he was just very keen on having outsiders there, so the tribe can do with them whatever they want. Okay, what else can I say about this movie. It is horrifying at times, funny during other sequences, very dark humor, but maybe the area where it delivers the most is the visual side. The costumes (especially the queen's massive flower dress we see at the end, she basically becomes a flower herself) are as spectacular as the cinematography and you could feel the burning light and heat very well through the screen here, almost like a knife cutting through and blinding you if we go with metaphors. This was very well done. And of course the make-up and sets as well. Nothing wrong there at all. So the only aspect where it did come a bit short (just a bit, not too much) is the script. I think they could have cut 30-45 minutes here and it still would have been a decent film for sure, even if it definitely did not drag too much. But there are scenes and sequences that feel like filler material. As I am approaching the end of my review, I also want to talk about the end of the movie, especially the scene when Pugh's character is really having her meltdown and the others there are screaming with her, basically following their new queen. Joining in with her. I also felt somehow that maybe she could get sacrificed, but she did not. She will have to wait till she gets 72 for that I suppose. Long way to go. That cut-throat gesture when the Swedish buddy was asked was also pretty good, pretty creepy too. And with Pugh in the end, her smile somewhat implied that her sanity was gone now too completely, even if the fact that she agreed that her boyfriend should be killed still felt more like an act of mercy than an act of cruelty or insanity with what they had done to him. This killing scene also explains the bear we see early on and that one was also very random and, as a consequence, very comedic. So yeah, I think I am in the minority here, but I liked this film more than ""Hereditary"", so this shows you that I am not as much of a fan when it comes to the latter as everybody else. I am still curious what Aster has coming up next. And in the future. The talent is undeniable. I hope he can continue this positive trend and make more good films. This one here is by no means perfect, but I give it a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. Never in doubt, but like I said: Don't watch it with kids or people who can't deal with graphic violence.",1446,15,20,True

imdb_midsommar_bertaut_20190724,Midsommar,IMDb,Bertaut,2019-07-24,7,NULL,"Very poorly advertised as something it isn't; will be sure to frustrate and impress in equal measure Much like his feature debut, Hereditary (2018), as well as such recent films as The Witch (2015) and It Comes at Night (2017), writer/director Ari Aster's Midsommar has been well received by critics but not so much by audiences. And, really, it's not hard to see why; all four films were promoted as horrors when they weren't, drawing in audiences who were disappointed that they didn't get what they were expecting. Midsommar is, at best, a thriller, and even that's pushing it. Whereas Hereditary was a study of grief, it undeniably had horror elements, but in Midsommar, apart from one brief moment involving somebody wearing somebody else's skin (don't ask), there's little resembling a horror trope. What it does have in abundance, however, is dread, and as with Hereditary, it's primarily an allegory built on a foundation of generic tropes. Whereas Hereditary dealt with the lengths one may go to shut off emotional pain, Midsommar is more interested in what happens when the initial pain of bereavement starts to wear off, especially when the only person one feels one can turn to isn't exactly sympathetic to one's situation. Aster himself has called it a ""breakup movie"", and it's hard to argue against this. And whilst the characters are underwritten, and the film is painfully predictable (especially if you're familiar with The Wicker Man (1973)), it's beautifully crafted, brilliantly shot almost entirely in glaring sunlight, and vastly ambitious. And much like Us (2019), it avoids the sophomore slump without necessarily knocking it out of the park. The film begins as Dani (a superb Florence Pugh) learns her bipolar sister has killed their parents and subsequently committed suicide. Already emotionally fragile and prone to anxiety attacks even before their deaths, Dani turns for support to her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor), an anthropology student struggling to find a topic for his PhD. Christian has wanted to break things off with Dani for some time, as he finds her overly needy, and had been trying to work up to ending the relationship prior to her family dying. The following summer, Dani learns that Christian and fellow students Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter) have been invited by Swedish student Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) to his ancestral pagan commune in Hårga, where a midsummer celebration that only occurs once every ninety years will be taking place. Dani is upset that Christian didn't tell her about the trip, and to placate her, he invites her to come, never imagining she will say yes. But she does. And it doesn't take long, for the visitors to learn that something isn't right in the commune. As Aster has said, Midsommar is really a breakup movie, with Christian as a classic manipulator. For example, after Dani learns about the trip, she's understandably upset that he didn't tell her, but in the space of a couple of minutes he manipulates her into apologising to him. The core of the story is her slowly coming to realise that he isn't the man she thought he was, and in a weird way, it's a variation on the female revenge genre. In this sense, it's primarily an allegory for the process of a young woman's emotional/spiritual awakening. Indeed, one could take this even further if one reads the character names as symbolic; Dani's surname is Ardor, but she's denied love, and in the paganism of the commune, she's offered something she can't get from a self-serving Christian(ity). Aesthetically, the film looks terrific. Whereas the US scenes are dark and confined, taking place in small poorly lit rooms with the characters wearing drab costumes, once the film shifts to Sweden, the visual design changes completely. Henrik Svensson's production design emphasises an open-plan vastness with unlimited space to move, but few places to hide; Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography drenches everything in glaring sunlight; and Andrea Flesch's costume design focuses on brilliant white. Indeed, the attention to detail in the presentation of the commune is immensely impressive; the long middle act doesn't really feature much in the way of narrative incident, but it does a fine job of creating a milieu that feels authentic and lived-in. There are also some nice individual moments. For example, the choral singing with which the film begins is harshly interrupted by a telephone ringing, suggesting the clash between tradition and modernity; Dani's hysterical crying upon learning of her family's deaths blends with Bobby Krlic's discordant music; a superb single-take shot takes Dani from heading to her apartment bathroom to entering the bathroom of an airplane; a high altitude shot showing a car travelling along a country road is imbued with malevolent undercurrent as the car passes under the camera, but rather than turning around to pick the vehicle up on the reverse angle, the camera follows the car by turning downwards, ending up upside-down. In terms of the narrative design, somewhat unusually, the film wears its predictability on its sleeve, with many of the major narrative beats not only foreshadowed but literally shown to the audience prior to occurring in the story, whether it be the mural that opens the film or the illustrations seen on the walls all over the commune. With that in mind, anyone who has seen any folk horror will be able to predict much of what happens. Even if you're only familiar with The Wicker Man, you'll still be able to take a decent stab at how things turn out. As for the acting, much as Hereditary was Toni Collette's, Midsommar belongs entirely to Florence Pugh. For most of the film, she's on the precipice of a nervous breakdown, with her performance redolent of Shelley Duvall in The Shining (1980). This is easily her best and most layered performance thus far, especially the gamut of contradictory emotions she runs in the insane last 20 minutes. Elsewhere, the performances are all fine, but the actors aren't helped by the script. As Christian, Jack Reynor is the least convincing academic ever put on screen, although he does do a decent job of getting the audience to loathe his passive-aggressive persona. Will Poulter plays Mark as the kind of ignorant sex-crazed loudmouth that seems to only exist in the movies. As Josh, William Jackson Harper barely registers, whilst Vilhelm Blomgren's Pelle is so obviously untrustworthy that it pushes suspension of disbelief to breaking point. As this might suggest, one of the biggest problems with the film is the underwritten characters. Additionally, Dani and Christian's relationship is demarcated along stereotypical lines - the emotional female whose need for support becomes overwhelming and the thoughtless bro who is more interested in hanging out with the boys. Another issue is that even aside from the character of Pelle, the film pushes suspension of disbelief too far. There are multiple moments when the goings-on should prompt the visitors to leave immediately, but they repeatedly accept the most ridiculous of situations based upon the most tenuous of explanations. Indeed, in a lot of ways, they're no different from the idiots who get picked off one-by-one in so many cheap slasher films. Additionally, as already mentioned, there are few surprises here. Aster is obviously a big fan of folk horror, but he allows reverence to the tropes supersede narrative inventiveness, leading to predictability. Also, as in Hereditary, the explanation for what's going on isn't anywhere near as interesting as the ambiguity preceding it. That said, however, I did enjoy Midsommar. Aesthetically impressive, and built on a terrific central performance, it could be cited as an example of a filmmaker whose ambitions outweigh his abilities, but ultimately, Aster's mastery of tone sees him through. The script could use some work, no doubt, but the ominous sense of dread is palpable throughout and is brilliantly handled, whilst the depiction of the death throes of a toxic relationship is as penetrating and emotionally honest as any ostensible relationship drama. Unnerving and audacious, Midsommar is an exceptionally confident piece of filmmaking, if not necessarily an exceptional piece of filmmaking.",1348,16,22,False

imdb_midsommar_zkonedog_20200202,Midsommar,IMDb,zkonedog,2020-02-02,7,Perhaps The Strangest Movie Of 2019,"When the credits rolled on my ""Midsommar"" watching experience, my first thought was ""that was the strangest movie I've seen in quite some time"". I probably should not have been surprised, seeing as how this was director Ari Aster's next project after the equally quirky ""Hereditary"". While I can't go so far as to say that the strangeness of ""Midsommar"" made it one of my favorite films, I did--aside from one fatal flaw--enjoy the overall experience. For a very basic overview, ""Midsommar"" sees young adult Dani (Florence Pugh) going through a hard time. Her entire family is destroyed by an incredibly traumatic event, and to top things off boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is waffling within the relationship. Somewhat reluctantly, Christian and his fellow dissertation-searching friends invite Dani on their trip to Sweden to study Midsommar festivals. What they all find is an experience unlike anything that has ever been witnessed. The setup in this film is generally very solid. The whole process sort of reminds me of films like ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", where the filmmakers do a great job of creating authentic characters while surrounding them with an air of mystery. In the journey to the actual festival, all the characters here seem like they could be playing out a very believable scenario, and that makes them ultra-relatable. Once at the crazy Swedish festival, the film is sort of a combination of ""The Village"" and ""The Wicker Man"". While the proceedings start off as fairly innocuous, the bizarreness of the whole thing slowly unveils itself. Very well-paced in terms of not getting too crazy too fast, while also getting in enough scares/thrills to satisfy the audience. A lot of praise so far, so why the seven-star rating? Because ""Midsommar"" suffers from one fatal flaw: (Warning: Heavy spoilers ahead!) This is very much a metaphor film. If taken literally, the events make very little sense. Only after looking at it from a certain lens do the pieces begin to fall into place. Essentially, the entire movie is Dani's grief experience of losing her family and then not being supported by her boyfriend. In order for that to ""work"", though, the film needed to make it more clear that Christian was indeed a dead-beat, lame partner. In all honesty, the down-to-earth quality of the character writing might have actually hurt the film in this regard, as I never got the sense that Christian was an out-and-out villain. As the film itself expressly states, ""maybe Dani is being too clingy/needy?"". While surely not ultra-supportive, I just never got that sense that Christian was the ""big bad"" here, and without that the overall metaphor (especially the ending) falls a bit flat. Overall, though, ""Midsommar"" fascinated me enough for me to give it solid marks. The major misstep described above prevented me personally from totally buying in, but I can easily see others not having that problem (provided they recognize it for the metaphor journey that it is, of course).",496,9,10,True

My gut reaction was negative, but by putting together different plot points and comparing the attention to detail that was a highlight of his 2018 film Hereditary, I am more than satisfied with the end result. For example, the painting above Dani's bed features a bear and a young girl with some sort of tiara or crown on her head, foreshadowing the gruesome end for her boyfriend. If you are looking for a summer horror film, you will be disappointed with Midsommar's lack of true evil horror, but will likely come out of the theater feeling satisfied with the substance of the bizarre and wicked coming full circle to create a narrative which, similar to Hereditary, has a more abstract and impactful meaning than simply shock value horror (yet, this aspect is not at all ignored in the movie). Hereditary and Midsommar share a very exclusive genre which bonds intense thrillers with creepy paganism, yet also touches the familial nerve, and illustrates both healthy and unhealthy ways to process grief and relationships, whether they be familial or not. All in all, the movie was definitely worth the watch for those who are into experimentalist horror films (such as The Wicker Man), but one needs to keep an eye open for important allusions and foreshadowing motifs for over two hours, which can get tiring after a while.",243,16,13,True

There is one scene where you could hear her reaction without seeing her face, and I could feel what she was feeling deep in my bones. I'm so impressed.

Midsommer gives the feel of an unending trip gone terribly bad. I honestly haven't felt so anxious watching a movie since I saw Requiem for a Dream.

This one is like a boiling over teapot, it just railroads through to the end. It is not chocked full of action, but has just enough to propel the story forward. In fact, the longer passages, in a 2:20 run time, add to your feeling of being immersed in the characters situation.

The film takes a bright paintout of sunlight throughout, which creates a stark contrast to the dark and unsettling events that unfold. The detailing in the set design and costumes further immerses the audience in the unique unsettling atmosphere of the village. Florence Pugh delivers a captivating portrayal of Dani, capturing the character's vulnerability and gradual descent into madness.

The pacing of the film is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully absorb the disturbing events as they unfold. The use of symbolism and foreshadowing adds depth to the narrative, making MIDSOMMAR a thought-provoking and unsettling experience. The horror elements of MIDSOMMAR are not reliant on jump scares or gore. Instead, the film relies on psychological terror and a constant sense of unease.

In general, the whole thing lacks a lot of spice and soul, but some of the imagery is striking, the director having chosen to film everything from a distance in a very picturesque way, which maximizes the more deliberately mystical portions, thanks in large part to the surrounding nature more than anything else. The cast is pretty good, but not memorable. A nice minor film, which perhaps has the main drawback of looking like something other than what it really is, like an exuberant butterfly with intricately patterned wings that make it seem more dangerous than it truly is.",260,3,2,True

imdb_midsommar_niels2765_20200208,Midsommar,IMDb,niels2765,2020-02-08,10,Perfect in every single way.,"Midsommar is a 2019 horror film directed by Ari Aster (Hereditary) and stars Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor as a dysfunctional couple who travel to Sweden to visit the Midsommar festival. This festival, located in a quaint Swedish village quickly turns into an unsettling and violent holiday, hosted by a pagan cult. It's very hard to achieve a perfect 10/10 score from me. The film has to be perfect in every aspect, both technically, and story-wise. Midsommar is a perfect film. Every single act, every single scene, every single shot... is perfect. I watched this film for my second time last night, yet this time I watched the director's cut, still perfect. But just what makes this film so good? The film stays clear of horror cliches. No lazy jump scares and no stupid exposition to keep the plot going, just a genuine film, that is written brilliantly by Ari Aster. The film has clear inspiration from other horror films, which seems to be a common criticism among the audience members, but why should that be a criticism? The film is still original, yes it takes some plot devices from other films, and yes some shots/scenes may be inspired, but why does that matter? Every film has inspirations, every film will have occasions where it may not be original. Besides the point, Midsommar takes these inspirations and just improves on them. Florence Pugh's performance is the best of this year. No argument. She is stunning. One of the best modern actresses today. She is outstanding in what may be the greatest horror film performance of all time. The rest of the class is just phenomenal. Will Poulter manages to bring humour into such a horrific, eerie story, and Jack Reynor really makes his and Florence Pugh's character's relationship so alive. The film's cinematography was also, the best of this year. So gorgeous, and how almost this whole film is shot in natural light, and during day time, is genius. The film leaves me in dismay and shock, despite it being a horror film, shot in the daytime. I loved the use of natural light, and the cinematography again is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Each shot gives me a sense of discomfort and manages to unsettle me. So damn creative as well. Goddamnit just thinking about the cinematography makes me want to cry of happiness. The score is the best of this year easily. Bobby Krlic creates a score that incorporates elements of Swedish folk music that proves to be horrifically hopeless. The score somehow stands out to the already unbelievable film. Take a listen to the score. Please. The score is so soothing, so delightful, yet behind such a disgustingly gory and disturbing film. The film's story is fantastic. A great narrative, with deeper meaning. I loved watching this film a second time. I could interpret the film any way I wanted to. The movie is a slow burn, much like Ari Aster's previous work Hereditary (2018). I slowly watched everything go to crap, and I loved it. The film is a perfect cult movie. Watch it.

imdb_midsommar_ironhorse_iv_20200519,Midsommar,IMDb,ironhorse_iv,2020-05-19,6,This movie may become a cult classic. It's a Smörgåsbord of weirdness.,"Originally pitch as a straightforward slasher film about a group of American tourists being killed off by a surreal but vicious pagan cult during their midsummer festival in a remote Swedish village. The film directed by Ari Aster added elements to the concept about deteriorating relationship between the emotional trouble main character college student Dani Arbor (Florence Pugh) and her emotionally distant cultural anthropologist boyfriend Christian Hughes (Jack Reynor). This was done in order for Aster to cope after he just experienced a difficult breakup. For the most part, this extra subplot was fine for most audience. After all it somewhat works as a semi metaphor for the rapid decline of Abrahamic religions within the western society. The phone calls in the beginning is one such example. Much like a prayer I like how the film is shot set squarely on the character's face implying that she's talking to somebody who isn't fully there to help her. Nobody home. Even with people in her presence, the movie views those discussions through reflections of glass. In spirituality, mirror is said to reflect the act of continual self-evaluation regarding the consequences of thoughts and actions. It shows how detachment she is in this somewhat cold alienating world only wanting to egocentric procreate. That's why it makes sense that Dani would eventually fell seduced by the warmth of Harga community after first rejecting them after the public Ättestupa senicides. She slowly sees that the villagers repeatedly appear to share feeling including pain and pleasure. They're also seem supported and only produced what seem good for the community rather than selfish means. Being more in line with nature's circle of life than it seems. The metaphor of the grass growing on her, represented Dani's rebirth as a seed rooting herself back into the society after burying herself with haunting guilt of a past tragedy. The more she spends in the bright light of the community, the more she becomes willing to pollinated through Harga own means. By the end, she has become the new definition of the flower generation to the point of absurdity. She found free love and peace in an unusual way. As for the other characters, their wiliness to stay after the senicides seem a little more baffling than Dani. Especially when it comes to their very lack of reaction to death. Even with the amounts of drugs in their system, the brainwashing of both Josh (William Jackson Harper) & Christian are really not well established. I get that Josh is an apolitical scholar just looking for fame and Christian is an unsympathetic opportunist what a be savior. Nevertheless, fighting over a thesis is not a great justified for them staying at Harga after witnessing people getting killed. There has to be something more which the film fails to mention. Then there is Mark (Will Poulter) whom impulsive dumb character seems really out of place and not needed as much of his story about wanting to score could had gone to Christian. After all, there was no good exposition dump on why he wasn't around the cliff to witness the senicides. Also, to add onto that, what happen to the rest of the tourists that came to the village on the first day? They all seem to disappear along with the baby. I doubt that the cult killed all of them for no good reason. There is no way the villagers will be able to get away with all that death rituals in the cellular age without a family member finding out. Since we on the topic of the ceremonies. The film is a bit unclear about the rituals and how often they do it. The 90 years exposition seem to be a bit muddled. I didn't know it meant the barn burning until I listen to the director's commentary much later. It's that confusing. Still it does still beg the question how Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren)'s parents died in a house fire if that wasn't it. To add onto that weird mess, it seems like some of the rituals could had cut out as many of them didn't really add much to the main story like the subplot with the cult's inbred oracle. They did truly come across as unrealistic drawn out sensory overload surrealism that was somewhat funny than frightening. Despite that I felt that cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski did a great job with most of the shots. While super long, the whole establishment opening was a masterpiece. It was super creepy & disturbing. Very scary. There was also a lot of foreshadowing Easter eggs like the 1939's 'Wizard of Oz' references, bear artwork and the bouquet behind the photo of Dani. Even the very first shot of the film shows a full frame medieval folk pagan mural detailing roughly the entire sequence of events that will unfold. I also like how the film communicates the near constant hallucinogenic induced state by distorting and warping the scenery. For example, seeing Dani's family haunting her & turning the camera view upside-down on the Highway to Halsingland scene. Lots of rewatch value. I would love to one day watch all of the director's cut of the film. It's just over a half hour longer and contains more looks at both the American characters' dynamics, some cut rituals like the drowning kid and overtly supernatural elements like feet levitating off the ground. It might be interesting to look at and listen to, along with the full dark ambient eerie soundtrack composed by musician the Haxan Cloak. Overall: While the costumes might look nothing like Swedish culture & nobody really speaks with the region appropriate accent. I still said it's worth watching despite some people finding the film depiction of an iconic good nature Swedish holiday offensive and racist. It was still well shot, had fine performances even with the goofy memeable faces and downright entertaining for the most part. It's one trippy movie.",989,5,6,True

If you are a horror fan or even just read the synopsis you can see where the film is going from about 15 minutes in, that's ok if the plot has some twist or unpredictable elements but unfortunately it basically plays out like you expect. The film has some good moments and starts off with similar themes of grief and loss that Hereditary had which was expertly done again here. There is also quite a lot of humour (mainly from Will Poulter) which was done well. When the group goes to Sweden there are a few moments of horror and definitely a feeling that something is not right (which you expect from reading the synopsis) but way too much of the ceremonies, chanting and communal wailing which I ended up getting a bit bored with and wanting more to happen. I have no problem with long films building an atmosphere of dread but they honestly could have shaved 30 minutes off the run time and the film would have been no different. As the film progresses towards the end there is one bizarre elongated sex scene that had people laughing out loud in the cinema I was in. Although there is lots of general weirdness and strange cult practices which does convey a sense of uneasiness I don't think there was enough of a feeling of genuine dread or horror. I kept thinking the slow build up would lead to some really horrendous scenes towards the end and some unpredictable ending but for me there was nothing particularly shocking or scary towards the end.

And despite the sometimes gory shots, as a horror movie it actually doesn't really fit in the genre. Which is refreshing. The movie delivers in the acting, as has been said many times before. And it is a psychedelic trip on one level. On the other hand, this movie is all about belonging somewhere. Having an environment that is caring and loving and healthy. And that's what's so good about this movie to me. If your environment is toxic, uncaring and unhealthy, like Dani's is, it is actually a lot better to be included in a society that has it's brutal rituals but definitely is loving and caring. At the end of this movie i was rooting for the Swedish commune instead of Dani's friends. What did help in this proces was the fact that the horror scene's weren't really scary, and, as a critical note, the special effects / grime wasn't that convincing and sometimes a bit laughable.

imdb_the_witch_movie_muse_reviews_20170115,The Witch,IMDb,Movie_Muse_Reviews,2017-01-15,8,"""The Witch"" is horror for cinephiles, not as much horror genre fans","There's another version of ""The Witch"" that could've existed. A Puritan family in New England gets terrified by a witch living in the woods, who torments them with supernatural Satanism. If you're saying to yourself, ""wait, isn't that exactly what this movie is?"" then you've come to the right review. I'm not what you'd call a fan of horror movies. I don't gravitate toward the genre and I almost never seek horror movies out in theaters. That said, any movie that garners critical acclaim or positive buzz piques my interest as a fan of cinema on the whole. ""The Witch"" lives in that territory as a horror movie for cinephiles, not for audiences who love the thrill of a good scare. That's not to say ""The Witch"" isn't scary; it is. It's just not scary in the modern trend-driven, formulaic, ""movie trailer that ends with a jump-scare"" kind of way. Writer and director Robert Eggers, who makes his feature film debut, builds his terror with tension drama and mystery, not by creating the pervasive sense that some creepy thing will pop into the frame at any moment. Eggers, a production designer first and foremost, builds his ""Puritan nightmare"" from the ground up, starting with all the tiniest era-appropriate details in the set, costumes and even dialogue. It doesn't take a historian to notice the immaculate craftsmanship and consideration of time and place. Eggers' devotion to this realism pays off in that the ""The Witch"" never loses its footing in reality even as more supernatural elements creep into the story. Well, until the end, but let's not go there except to say that by then, the realism matters much less. The story follows a Puritan family that leaves its plantation and village over religious differences and goes off to build a home near the edge of the woods. Suddenly, the family infant, Sam, disappears under the watch of the eldest child, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). The incident devastates the mother (Kate Dickie) and father (Ralph Ineson), who convince everyone it was a wolf that took Sam, but the tragedy trickles down to the four children, Thomasin, pre-teen Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) and young twins Jonas and Mercy. Of course, the audience is privy to what actually happened to Sam, and we know things will only get worse for the family. Considering the legitimate Puritan fear of Satan and witches, the subsequent events begin to tear into the family dynamics, which adds to the tension that already exists over what unnerving thing might happen next. The story could definitely have gone deeper into distrust and paranoia, but then it might have become too much of a ""witch trial"" movie. The way the movie ends will draw no shortage of opinions, but without a doubt, Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke have made an and utterly engrossing film that would be just as effective had it just been a period drama instead of a horror film - from a visual standpoint. Blaschke works almost exclusively with available natural light, which in addition to bolstering Eggers' emphasis on realism, keeps the specter of darkness and evil hanging over the family. In fact, had the film not marketed itself so overtly as a horror film, it might have been given more awards consideration. Regardless, Eggers delivers a remarkable feature debut that's a definite breakthrough candidate; he will certainly have a lot of eyes on his future projects. His focus on detail and strong cinematic instincts could work wonders on a more mainstream project, but if he opts for more small-budget genre films, no complaints here. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

The film is a loving and accurate recreation of Puritan New England in the 1600s with everything from the language to the sets being authentic to the period. That in and of itself makes it fascinating to watch. Having lived in Virginia, where the Jamestown Settlement and the 1600s sometimes can seem like they happened the day before yesterday, I especially enjoyed the film. The location, in Ontario, reminded me of rural Virginia in winter, which made me quite homesick. So the film might have affected me more than some other audience members. The Witch is a fascinating glimpse into Christianity as practiced by 17th century Puritans. Satan and Evil are almost tangible presences in the woods and wilderness of the New World, while God is a distant, cold, and demanding being who must be constantly begged for forgiveness and mercy, since all human thoughts, words, and deeds seem to be gravely sinful and offensive to his eyes. A family of seven (parents, four children, and an infant) are exiled from their plantation community for not adhering to the accepted interpretation of scripture. They build a farm at a distance from the plantation near a frightening wood. The farm is failing (the family won't have food to last the winter). Meanwhile, the infant has been snatched from the oldest daughter while in her care at the edge of the wood. From this point on the family either descends into madness or is destroyed by Satan in the form of a witch who lives nearby in the woods.

Young fellow here, didn't watch any 'classics' horror movies but I do enjoy horror movies in general as long as they are not just gore type of movies. I'd say my favorite horror movies are The Ring and The Conjuring. So, past that to The Witch. I'd start by saying the movie was not what the trailer lead me to believe. This is not as much about scary moments or jump scare and more about a family coping with a lost child, and the movie trying to build suspense and just make the viewer feel uncomfortable. Because of this, I can see why some people will see it as really really slow with not much happening. Some PLUSES for me: - Anya Taylor-Joy (the older daughter) is amazing in this movie and I also think Ralph Ineson (the father) did a good job. - the score is really really good, there are periods of intense silence and periods of creepy music at just the right times to build tension - the cinematography with nice wide shots combined with the score works really well in most moments For the MINUSES: - I felt like the other child's acting was pretty bad and over the top and just took me out of the movie in most scenes where they are the focus (thankfully there were not THAT many) - a bit too slow of a pacing during the first half even for my taste So, just like I said in the title, KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. If you go and expect your typical horror movie with jump scares and a hidden 'baddie' slowly revealing itself along the movie in scary scenes, THIS IS NOT IT. This is mostly a family drama that tries to build suspense and make the viewer feel uneasy. On a side note, I caught this on a premiere showing with a theatre half full and the occasional comments, coughs and even laughter from some 'individuals' took me out of some moments. If you do want to watch this in the cinemas, I would recommend waiting and going way past premieres and on a awkward day / time so you have the cinema close to empty.

I recommend you not to believe the hype and watch the movie with an open mind. Otherwise you risk being disappointed like I was. The source material for this movie is amazing. Folktales are a horror goldmine and it's a shame you don't see it being used so often. The movie draws you in with it's original concept and stetting. The approach to horror itself is very unorthodox in the sense that most horror movies nowadays rely on obscurity or grotesque visuals. This movie shows horror in broad daylight, the camera is steady, there are no monsters, no gore. So what good is it? - Realism. Especially in the supernatural scenes. The rawness of theses scenes is the best part. You're always asking yourself 'is this superstition or is this real?' and 'who is the real villain?'. Of course that's until the charm is ruined by the bullshit ending where those questions are answered in the worst way possible. If they left room for speculation and stuck to the subtle approach I would've given this film a 6 or a 7. 'The Witch' had some good ideas but it's far from perfect. I feel sorry for people who claim that this movie is some 'masterpiece'. Apparently they've been watching only shitty movies this whole time. The cinematography was dry and even felt effortless. I liked the composition in only one shot: the dinner prayer. The picture lacks tonal contrast to compensate the lack of color. It just fails at grasping your attention. Only parts where the dryness benefits the movie are the horror scenes, all the other shots are just tedious and repetitive. Sorry, but it needs to have style or at least some visual value before it can qualify as a 'masterpiece'. The actors did a great job. My favorite was Kate Dickie as Katherine who I think came off as more threatening then the actual witch. You can tell that 'The Witch' was heavily inspired by Stanley Kubrick's work (sadly Eggers doesn't take notes from his shot composition though). Not only has it similar motives to 'The Shining' but also a soundtrack that resembles Ligeti's 'Requiem' form '2001 Space Odyssey'.",380,110,78,False

Lately I've been seeing more and more movies like this one. Good atmosphere with zero plot. The storyline is just plain boring. The entire movie is built on religious babbling and paranoia. Old time superstitions and no real substance. You get the idea really fast and after that there's nothing. No story, no characters development, nothing. It took me two days to finish watching the movie because I was bored. I even considered stop watching it but I wanted to know if there was a point. Something I didn't see. Well, there wasn't. Now, just to be clear, I understand the premise of the movie. It basically shows the hardships of the period. The struggles, the faith, the superstitions etc. There's a lot of symbolism in the film. They are trying to show us what it was like and how people thought back then but that said, the bottom line is this: if a horror movie is boring then it's just not doing its job. Maybe as a creepy historical drama it could have worked somehow but I'm not even sure how. Truthfully, reading about the movie was more interesting than actually watching it. It's a real missed opportunity imho. So while it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's also not a great one. I actually think that with more work on the script this movie could have easily been a great one but because there's no real substance, real storyline it just misses the mark.

It has the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary (softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told at the time. The characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial town. They also have period Calvinist attitudes, and the storytelling doesn't present an outsider's view of this or offer a modern commentary, but instead it just displays these attitudes and tells a story from the characters' standpoint. Their reliance on period folklore means that it doesn't strictly follow modern horror movie tropes, either. It has the slow build of a modern psychological horror/thriller as well as the standard formula where tragedies start from tragic flaws, but the traditions it's drawing on depend on a Calvinist's conception of flaws, and treat witchcraft as a horrible, well-understood occurrence rather than a shocking supernatural surprise. This story applies these perspectives. It's very well done in terms of writing, acting, and other aspects of execution, so it might have cross-over appeal to fans of horror, folklore, or straight period drama from colonial America.",245,263,135,False

The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters this year, and it's easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film's brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score. It's hard for an audience of this day and age to get into a period piece set in the 17th century without any big name actors or action elements. And I have to admit that I wasn't sure I wanted to see a film like this, especially with its horror elements. But my eyes were pealed from beginning to end. I wouldn't say anything about the story shocked me or had me confused, but the imagery, score, and uncompromising nature to Robert Egger's direction left me breathless. Within 10 minutes I was looking at the screen and whispering to myself ""why would you go there?"", ""Don't do that!"", or ""come on, really?"". Not because I thought it was poor story- telling, but because I was so invested as to what these characters were doing. With that said, I don't think this film is for everyone. It's brutal, harshly relentless, and utterly disturbing. The characters use all 17th century dialogue and the cinematography sets this grey and ominous tone. The imagery from beginning to end will stick in your head as it has done with me. But that's the way horror films should be. I wouldn't say it's more a psychological thriller because there are plenty of terrifying moments, but it is more for the 'Under the Skin' crowd than it is for people who love 'The Conjuring'. Even in its harsh moments, I was always invested and I can't deny the quality of the writing, directing, and acting all around.

Instead of the safety of being around others, now he and his brood have to live within the forest. One day, when the oldest daughter Thomasin is playing with the youngest, Samuel, the baby disappears, stolen by a witch and devoured. William insists that a wolf stole the child while his wife is decimated for the rest of the film. William's lies move the story further in motion - he takes Caleb hunting deep in the wood when he has promised his wife he would not and he sells her father's cup for hunting supplies. Meanwhile, Mercy and Jonas, the twin children of the family, insist that they speak to the goal named Black Phillip while contending with Thomasin that they are also witches. The next morning, son Caleb leaves to see if he can get food for his family, thereby keeping them from selling Thomasin into servitude. She goes along with him, but their dog chases a hare and their horse throws Thomasin as Caleb is lost in the woods, eventually being seduced by yet another witch. Soon, all Hell is literally breaking loose. Caleb returns, near death, and throws up an apple before his violent death. The twins forget how to pray and go into a trance. And the mother is convinced that Thomasin is behind it all. Up until this point, the film moves at an incredibly slow pace. Get ready. I don't want to spoil anything, but it gets more and more demented, paying off everything you've been waiting for. The first film for Robert Eggers, this shot in natural light film is something to behold. It seems much more confident than a first film would suggest. There is also a lot of attention paid to supernatural detail, such as the Enochian language used throughout for the witches. I've debated the end of this film so many times. Is it about Thomasin's escape from teen to full womanhood? Is it the sin of William's pride destroying his entire family? Is it about the fact that evil actually exists and that it may claim even the most pious? Or is the issue that William only sees the hellfire and brimstone of the Gospel when he should be preaching the literal Good News, the celebration of Christ conquering death?

The atmosphere Eggers creates alone is enough to wrench serious dread from scenes other directors would be otherwise unable to make even remarkable. The score, too, helps cull this dark tone and adds life to a film that can be borderline tedious. That being said, ""The Witch"" is not for everyone. It is strange, slow but steady, gruesome at points, and almost un-watchable at others. There are two sides to this film; one which I had hoped the director would stick to concerning the family and their struggle with religion and isolation; and another which plays as an undercurrent to most of the film and then takes charge in the end. Sadly, it is this second side which keeps me from giving the film a better score, and that ultimately hurts the film in the very final scene. Overall, I enjoyed ""The Witch"" and its originality. Eggers has achieved a film that, for all its low-budget and independent film background, feels richer and better made than many horror entries of late. Should you decide to see it, a word of caution: do not expect a fast-paced movie full of jump scares and creepy crawlies emerging left and right.

When the infant child of the family disappears inexplicably, a chain of increasingly bizarre events lead to claims of witchcraft and sorcery that implode the family. Based on the plot summary, much about ""The Witch"" seems fairly predictable, and that's because it is. Robert Eggers makes no bones about reality or superstition here; this is, as it is branded, a ""New England folktale"" through and through. It's also allegorical on some levels, and is about an English family's failure to conquer the vast American frontier. Regardless of how it is read, the film's surface plays out like classic accounts of witchcraft and superstition that pervaded Puritan Calvinism in the seventeenth century. What director Eggers does here is weave a taut and unsettling narrative through a series of meditative visuals and haunting encounters with evil--some have said not much happens in the film, and they're right--but is that the point of such a tale? The story is mediated through phenomenal performances that are the real emotional center of the film, while rare but fantastical occurrences with the supernatural jar the audience as much they do the family. Eggers' direction is remarkable, and the cinematography consistently captures the gloom of a New England winter; close-ups show the younger children engaging with their ominous farm goat, while pans of characters venturing into the woods create a legitimate sense of danger--and that is another of the film's prevailing themes. In the film, the threat of danger lurks in all matter, be it in the natural environment, in doctrine, or the horrifying corporeal locus where the two meet. Overall, ""The Witch"" is a surprising and moody entry in the horror genre for 2016; it is not only recalling classicism in its period setting and narrative, but also in its cinematic approach to storytelling. It is old-fashioned in just about every way, but is no less masterful at creeping into the skin as insidiously as evil does within the family. We feel their terror, their desperation, and their yearning for absolution; and that is what makes the film such an effective mood piece. 9/10.",374,224,156,True

They build a small house and a barn and meanwhile Katherine delivers the baby Samuel. One day, Thomasin is playing with Samuel near the forest and the baby mysteriously vanishes. The family unsuccessfully seeks Sam out and Katherine becomes insane, praying all the time and mistreating and blaming her daughter for everything wrong in their lives. However, Sam was abducted and slaughtered by a witch that lives in the woods that used his blood to paint her body. William goes to the forest to hunt since the crop has failed and he confides to his son that he sold Katherine's silver goblet to buy supplies. However he is a bad hunter and misses his target. In the farm, the twins tell Thomasin that they speak to the goat Black Phillip. While having dinner, Katherine accuses Thomasin of losing her cup and William does not tell the truth. During the night, Thomasin and the children overhear her mother telling William to deliver Thomasin to work for another family. Early in the morning, Caleb, Thomasin, their dog and the family horse go to hunt in the woods.

""The Witch: A New-England Folktale"" is an American/British/Canadian/Brazilian production by Robert Eggers that shows a scary view of religious fanaticism, ignorance and madness in the Seventeenth Century, in New England. The horror is psychological and explores the primal fear of a family oriented by orthodox religious principles and their fear of God. There are creepy moments most of them without gore.

It is strange, there are probably some themes of sexism of female power that can be derived from it, but at least from the perspective of someone wanting to watch a horror film, this fell far short. The problem in my eyes lies with the question of who the villain is and the role that they play. Is it the witch, the devil, or someone in the family? I'm not sure we ever know. This was likely done intentionally to leave horror in the mystery of it, but it failed to be scary because whereas the cause was unknown the danger they face was predictable and weak. As a result, I was left bored and unsurprised when bad things happened. In addition, it felt as if there was nothing the family could have done to prevent it. I think hopelessness has an important role in many films, but hopelessness on top of anything else just makes it even harder to watch. They tried to do too much with this film. The Witches Cabin, the horny son, the black goat, any one characteristic could've been expanded on into a meaningful plot point, but instead they all bleed and get lost into each other, confusing both the plot and the other characteristics.

imdb_the_witch_tomsuthblack_20160515,The Witch,IMDb,tomsuthblack,2016-05-15,10,How to drive people insane with guilt and fear? (A detailed manual),"((Disclaimer: Contains all sorts of spoilers)) Ever wondered where all those wretched creatures who lived solitary lives centuries ago at the edge of towns or deep in the woods came from? All the lonely (and dangerously insane) people known as witches and wizards, were nothing but the stray teenagers, or the stray housewives, driven totally insane by the accumulating sensations of guilt and fear encouraged by the morbid interpretations of the ""Gospel of Love"" which were common only a few centuries ago. Or so claims this wonderful marvel of psychoanalysis. social criticism, and cinematic excellence. Witch is neither your average boogieman flick, nor the latest trick in survival horror, where the beast (in this case dear Ol'Georgie himself) hunts the hapless victims one by one. It is a much bigger offering than that; an art movie that mastered all the commercial tricks of survival horror, and hid within them a potent social message. The movie's controlling idea is simple: The prevailing human desire to seek reassurance from a higher power can easily be twisted by ignorance, superstition, psychological insecurities and a horrendous misinterpretation of religion into a culture of self-flogging that nurtures guilt and fear until they become invincible beasts, then lets them lose on the mind to devour it whole. The result of this scary process is a flock of pariahs, known by the fancy, superstitious name of ""witches"" who live on the peripheries of society, devoid of any means of compassion, stripped of all sanity and civility, living in a world of morbid fantasies and diseased hallucinations in which they are left defenseless to their auto-cannibalistic minds that devour their sanity. The movie camera never assumes, for a second, that the supernatural aspect of the story (AKA the devil and his incarnations) doesn't exist except in the disintegrating minds of the story characters. The devil does show up on the screen, and so does the ""familiars"" (animal incarnation of witches). A witch does transform herself into a pretty maiden for our horrified entertainment purposes, and all that is candy for the eyes of the cinema goers. Yet, it is all clear that what you see is but the truth as seen from the diseased minds of the characters, and not the truth as it is. We are given a glimpse of what goes inside those guilty and ignorant superstitious minds, how the truth is perceived from their eyes. Through the hungry eyes of a depraved teenager who craves any female form(not excluding his sister's), we see how an ugly old hag could seem like a beauty, and her promise of a kiss (his very first kiss!) could be both irresistibly sweet, and revoltingly disgusting. And how the whole sexual experience afterwards (his very first) can be enough to drive him insane with joys he couldn't understand (and she kissed me, and went down, and then my bowels..oh, sweet Jesus take me in your lap, HAHAHA!) can drive him insane, feverish and howling until his little heart bursts. We see the old and dry wife on the verge of menopause, unable to contain the effects of her grief for her lost son, her alienation from her homeland, her suffering in a new unforgiving world, and her fear of competition from her blossoming daughter who had just seen the first signs of puberty. How she ends up a victim of self-mutilating thoughts and actions (the suckling craw scene is a masterpiece) We see the pious father, scared like hell from life (aka sin) and avoiding it whenever he can, escaping society whenever possible, flogging himself all the time and feeding his torturous, well-hidden feelings of unworthiness, xenophobia, and fear of a world much more powerful than he is, a world waiting for him, with its horrible evils, at every corner. No matter how hard he tries to vent off his anger on the farm animals or the logs of wood, no matter how far he tries to escape, no matter how he prays and cries and stuffs sand into his mouth to atone for his real and imaginary sins, his guilt and fear won't let him be, until he drives himself, and everyone around him(including the family goat), totally insane. And above all, we have the most rational of all, the young girl who is trying , patiently , to keep her rationality, and save her innocence in a family that had gone completely bonkers. They are always accusing her and themselves of being worthless products of sin, frightening incarnates of evil, and fuel-to-be for everlasting hell. She watches them descend to madness, one by one, losing a little part of her mind every time; until she gradually and very believably, reaches the inevitable moment where she sheds off the last shred of civility and rationality, and runs amok into the woods, welcoming her ascent into the dizzy heights of absolute insanity. We all know what she would look like in a few decades. We have seen one just like her who had spend her life in the woods, nurturing her insane thoughts, becoming diseased, disfigured, ill fed, turning into a frightening form of serial-killer and baby snatcher. The movie has shown us her life, and her face. We have seen, and fully known, the witch. We have also , through the movie , seen and known evil, which is a form of insanity whose seeds are sown by ignorance and watered by guilt and fear. A great movie. It had done exactly what another movie, ""The Village"" has failed to do more than 10 years ago. It had delivered a very touching message about ignorance, about how guilt, fear and xenophobia have the power to corrupt and destroy the mind and the heart,especially under the effect of misinterpreted religion.

They have 6 mouths to feed, most of their crops are inedible, the father can't hunt worth sh*t, and they have recently lost a baby to either a wolf or a witch. The aging mother holds a grudge against her youthful daughter, Thomasina- if only using her as someone to take her anger out on for being stuck desolate in this god forsaken new land. So, she seeks to have her sent away to become someone else's problem. After overhearing this, the two older siblings set off to do something that is never specifically said. And, while they are out, their horse gets spooked, Thomasina falls off and is knocked unconscious. She wakes up alone, and makes her way back to the farm. Caleb, it seems, has gone to a house in the woods...the house of a witch...and become bewitched through lust. He returns naked, in the rain, pecked in the face. The Twins (two younger siblings) blame Thomasina, because she had jokingly told them she was a witch to scare them when they were being brats. But they took it seriously...and blame her. Even though it really seems like they (the twins) are the ones doing the bewitching, considering they are the ones talking to their creepy goat Black Phillip. Either way, Caleb has a demon in him. And they attempt to perform a farmhouse exorcism on him as best they can...during which he coughs up an apple and dies. To appease his terrified wife, the father locks the rest of the children away with the goats. Hoping that will contain the problem till morning. At which point he will take his daughter to the local plantation. But sh*t hits the fan, before morning has a chance to roll around. The twins are stolen by some nasty naked witch, and Black Phillip gets loose...goring their father to death. Now, only the mother is left, and she immediately attacks her daughter...ignoring her own godly premonition...turning against the only one who is left...the only one who is truthful, and good. And there is only one thing you can do when you're getting choked to death... This film is very atmospheric, and does a great job of putting you in a position of empathy with Thomasina- who we are, sort of, experiencing events through. But what really stands out, are the performances. For a period piece, with lots of Olde English (I had to watch with subtitles), everyone does a spectacular job. Ralph Ineson probably does the best job, as the father- it's like he stepped right out of the 1700's. The twins are both creepy as all hell- their unison responses send chills down your spine. Harvey Scrimshaw's portrayal of a bewitched and possessed Caleb is simply mindblowing, coming from such a young dude. And Anya Taylor-Joy's portrayal of Thomasina is absolutely genuine, on a purely human level. The ending, however, is very abrupt. And left me wanting more. I felt they could have stretched the film a bit longer, and used that to develop her initiation more. But it's not my film, so who am I to complain.

imdb_the_witch_leonardooliva69_20250117,The Witch,IMDb,LeonardoOliva69,2025-01-17,9,A very good debut in a rather hackneyed genre.,"You have to be very good in every sense for your first film to be a work of art. In just 89 minutes Robert Eggers makes a dream debut: his first film becomes a cult film. Pagan and psychological terror in a closed location and with only a handful of actors. That and much more is ""The Witch"". Perhaps on a first viewing many things will be overlooked, but on repeat viewing and thinking about the film over and over again things start to emerge. Is what happens from the beginning real? Is it really a plot involving witches? Or is it the product of a delusional psychosis of a family that only eats bread, is hungry and is at the mercy of a patriarch with delusions of grandeur and mystics? I think the vast majority of us agree on the first. And if so, it is a well-rounded story. The whole plot leads to one point: Black Phillip and his intention to recruit Thomasin for his coven of witches, making her succumb to desperation and desire. On the other hand, we have the main issue of the seven deadly sins, which clearly allude to Catholic doctrine, and that is how the Puritans considered it, and which is so well expressed throughout the film. The Puritans were reformed Protestants because they opposed the Church of England becoming so ""Catholic."" And it is in this conceptual simplicity that the entire main plot is handled. It is really understandable how Robert Eggers' career has several films that can be considered works of art under his belt. For now, ""The Witch"" is a more than recommendable option to see a different type of cinema that is so highly appreciated in these years.",289,10,3,True

You're sort of left wondering what the point of the last 92 minutes was. The main problem with this movie was that they tried (and failed) to write it in an older dialect of English and failed miserably, because, despite being filmed in Toronto which has at least 2 universities offering a linguistics program, they failed to ask a linguist how to speak the English properly. They used the word ""thou/thee/thy/thine"" as opposed to ""you/your/yours"" throughout the movie. The first problem with this is that this movie is happening after the Brits invading North America. The term ""thou"" died before this. The second problem with this is that they used the term incorrectly. The word ""thou"" is the singular second person pronoun, whereas ""you"" was the plural second person pronoun, or the singular polite second person. If you speak French, the word ""thou"" is the equivalent of the word ""tu"" and the word ""you"" is the equivalent of the word ""vous"". At one point, William says to his children, ""All of thee stop that!"" and even a week later I am still cringing. Other wrong parts, is that for some reason, we assume the first settlers must have spoken present-day British English (even though there is no ""one"" British English), when in reality, North American English, specifically Canadian English is, is more like Old English than any dialect of British English. One major part of this was the the characters took part in the deletion of h's and coda r's. Do you know how we know the first Brits to come to North America pronounced all the r's and h's? Because we in North America still pronounce all our r's and h's. What, did these people think Brits had stopped pronouncing r's and h's long before they came to North America and that somehow the sounds reappeared in North American English? The other problem is they went all Shakespearean style in their talking. Shakespeare not only happened 200 years before the time of this movie, but it was written in poetic prose meant to be like candy to the ears and did not reflect how people actually spoke. How would you feel if people 500 years from now looked at our poetry and assumed we all talked in ridiculous rhymes like that? The whole movie was an ear sore.

Horror films don't normally have an effect on me, much less scare me, but this one was unnerving in a very palpable way. It's about a Puritan family who are banished from their village for an unspecified religious offense, and subsequently move to a location bordering a forest. While there, repeated misfortune and isolation create the perfect storm of religious paranoia over whether one or more of them are possessed by the devil. What THE WITCH masterfully does is to create this tense atmosphere and maintain it over nearly the entire length of the film. Whether it be odd/surreal imagery, slow and deliberate camera-work, or an eerie score reminiscent of Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (used in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), all of it is used to brilliant effect and should be capable of rattling even the most seasoned viewer, especially if they have a religious background/upbringing (as I did). In fact, I sensed a lot of Kubrick here; not just 2001, but also THE SHINING. Not surprisingly, they share some thematic elements. The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation.

There are also a few jump scares, unlike what others have claimed by here. What went we out into this movie to find? We travailed a vast horror. For what? For what? If you went in to this movie knowing nothing, within the first 4 minutes you could tell it was a horror movie by the soundtrack alone. I don't really like this approach, because the soundtrack spoils the mood. In fact, the soundtrack precedes the actual mood of the film. You could argue it is creating the mood, sure, but I would rather let the story organically form to create the mood. From the start of the movie, the woods are the central horror of the unknown. After all, the family is being banished into the woods. There are several long shots of the woods with droning violin music. (Usually when naked babies appear in a film, they are male for some reason. I'm too afraid to google ""naked babies in film"" but it's for sure a trend. Draw your own conclusions.) The effects of isolation are immediately shown on the banished, isolated family. A young boy, Caleb, takes a peek of his sister's (Thomasin's) breasts as the camera zooms in because she is the most fertile female. He peeks at her many times. Thomasin exhibits motherly behavior toward Caleb. The mother brings up this fact. She is jealous that she is growing old. And she notices Caleb looking and blames the girl as tempting him. But can you blame Caleb really? The dialect is quite good in this movie. But since it's authentic, it also might require subtitles for one to understand easier. The setting of this movie is always overcast. Many horror movies just lower the contrast and hope that it will seem scarier. To me, this seems a bit overdone. I suspect that that rabbit is possessed by the Witch of the forest. You can tell this because of the rabbit's eyes. The goat also has peculiar eyes at one point. The ending to this is unsatisfying.

Eggers previous movie roles really shines through as the whole production is on point, especially the sets and the costumes. The film is often dark, even during the daylight hours giving an enormous sense of bleakness throughout. Ralph Ineson leads his devout Christian family with his wife and five children, who struggle to keep the farmstead going and there's possibly something working against them other than the elements. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the eldest of the children and is usually shackled with the responsibility of tending to her younger siblings while father and boy go off to hunt. But they soon fall prey to the Witch who lives in the nearby woods, but not how you might expect. Ineson is amazing and truly deserves much larger roles than the ones he's played previously. Taylor-Joy already appears to getting noticed as quite the star with Morgan and soon to be released Split. But the whole cast here perform amazingly well, and the script is quite astonishing with impressive diction. Mark Korven does quite the eerie score which probably makes up for a lot of the atmosphere, it resonates right through you immersing the viewer deeper in the film and I strongly suggest not listening to it in isolation alone. Unfortunately with all these key elements, the story, the script, the haunting score and the production as a whole, it's not at all scary and is more of a drama than horror. It certainly has that feel of the classic horrors like the original Wicker Man, but it just didn't get to me like it maybe should have. Having said that, this film is definitely split into two camps.

The film could be looked at as two separate stories heavily intertwined: the supernatural horror of the woods vs the very real terror of violence erupting within the family, and amazingly this is all done seamlessly, missing no beats and never seeming to give up one for the other. In that way, The Witch has the elegance of a clever children's story (A New England Folk Tale to be precise) with the intensity of a melodrama. This would never have worked if the cast didn't kill every role, but luckily for us they did; they murdered those roles. I don't think I've ever actually seen a movie during which people, in the middle of a crowd, screamed. The Witch did that. The Witch made people scream and gasp so loud the whole room heard and it did other things too: it told an engrossing, intelligent story. There are minor ""complaints"" I may have that keep it from being 10/10 (the shots don't carry the film as much as the writing,) but really this is a horror film that could easily make a top ten list.

The Witch is nothing special. It's nothing enjoyable, nothing memorable, and nothing that's worth revisiting at any point in the future. What began as a promising movie missed the mark entirely. It's in the same vein as the 2020 film The Turning: it set up a concept that had potential, and completely blew it with the execution. This movie was so painfully boring that every passing minute felt like torture. This story could've been engaging and truly suspenseful but, by the time the movie decides to actually do something with itself, it's too late. An audience will lose investment in a film's plot and characters if nothing happens for an extended period of time, and this movie excelled at that, offering a story that, even in its non-horror-centric plot points, couldn't be even mildly entertaining enough to hold interest. This movie is best served as background noise, because ultimately it's not worth much else. To pick positives to point out about this film would be the beautiful cinematography, the decent acting and the costuming.

And being someone who hates jump scares, that was refreshing. The Witch is about a Puritan family in the 1600s that is banished from their village, and then moves far away to a secluded area near a forest. In the forest, of course, resides a witch that kidnaps the family's youngest infant, and continuously messes around with the family throughout the movie. A lot of people say this film can be too slowly-paced at times, which I agree with. But I thought the slow-burn and subtlty worked really well. There were never any big moments with reveals, the way most horror/mysteries are. Little things would keep going wrong, and the suspense just kept building very slowly and painfully. But the ending definitely could've been played out a better...there were a few plot holes. If the goat was supposed to be the antagonist all along, what was the point of having the witch terrorize the family too? Also, who's responsible for kidnapping the twins, the witch or the goat? It was all too much to swallow at once, especially since the rest of the film was so much more subtle. And of course, Thomasin ends up killing her mother, and then joining the witch's side, which was a bit shocking but expected in a way. I guess she had no choice, since her whole family was dead. And the opening voice-over of her confessing her sins to God could've been an overshadowing of the ending--that she desired evil all along, as much as she tried to go against it. Another theory I have is that she (ironically) sacrificed herself to evil in order to pay for her family's death...since Thomasin told her mother ""I love you"" after killing her. These are just my ideas though; I have no idea what the director intended to say there. The cinematography, acting, dialogue, and score were solid. I'm amazed at how the actors were able to speak in character using such old dialogue, and I think it really contributed to how real the whole movie felt. A lot of people seem bothered by the filter, but I liked it. Imagining the movie with any more color makes me cringe...the filter fits the setting and mood perfectly enough. The score was subtle, like the film itself. It popped out when necessary and wasn't over dramatic. Almost nothing in this film was over-the-top except for the young kids' acting in some scenes. Overall I'd say this is a quality film that's definitely worth watching. It's a different kind of horror though, so know what to expect before you watch it.",457,13,15,True

This film is not only very good, but crafts an entire world -- a Salem-ish environment where it is not hysteria but reality.

This is easily one of the greatest psychological horror films of all time. It's going to stand tall in history along with titles such as The Shining, Alien, Psycho, and Nosferatu. Eggers creates such a realistically haunting portrayal of Puritan New England that I'm sure if someone from the 1630s were to have seen it (aside from calling me a witch for capturing souls on moving pictures or what have you) they might assume it was a literal portrayal of events. Genuinely disturbing and provocative, the VVitch is an absolutely masterful historically accurate story of an outcast zealot puritan family forced to live off the land near a dense forest far outside the settlement from which they were banished. But evil lurks in the forest, ever watching and waiting for an opportunity to prey on the helpless family as they prepare for winter. After the youngest, an infant named Samuel, mysteriously vanished during a game of peekaboo with the eldest daughter, Thomasin, the family slowly descends into madness.

imdb_the_witch_maatmouse_1_20160813,The Witch,IMDb,maatmouse-1,2016-08-13,7,Superstition and abandonment mar family's lives,"Saw The Witch on Blu Ray rather than cinema as felt that the cinema's public setting would ruin a film which relied heavily on the right atmosphere in order to effectively tell the story. I was right. For this film, you need silence. It is silence which lends this film its menace, rather than showy special effects. The Witch is set in the New World of the Puritan fathers. The main family of this film are mother and father, eldest daughter, younger brother, twins and a baby, newly born. Having been cast out of their puritan community for going against the community's teachings, in some way, the father takes his family to leave on the edge of a dark wood. He builds enclosures for goats and sets about growing corn to feed his family. His family pray regularly and look to God for forgiveness of their sins regularly. They are in all senses of the phrase, God Fearing people. Within this close and claustrophobic environment, tensions start to mount. The youngest member of the family disappears and is thought to be stolen by a creature in the woods who is seen as using the child for its nefarious ends. The baby is not seen again and with no idea of what happened to him. All this leads to the mother of the family (Katie Dickie, fresh from Game of Thrones) crying and accusing family members, mostly the eldest girl (Thomasina - played by Anya Taylor-Joy) of theft of a silver cup. Then there is the eldest boy, Caleb and his father going hunting in the woods looking for venison. They find a hare which is not killed and lose their dog in the process. More lies to the mother about the nature of their trip. Thomasina is ordered to clean her brother's clothes at the river on the edge of the wood. She does this and notices her younger brother taking a interest in her body. The twins join them and start joking about there being a witch in the woods. Thomsina holds the little girl down stating that she is the witch and she has made a pact with the devil etc. More upset and shouting. Naturally, things go from bad to worse. Caleb goes into the forest with his sister to find the family dog and she loses the only horse they have and Caleb finds the family dog dead with its entrails hanging out. He also discovers the woodland house of the 'witch', a seemingly young, beautiful woman who kisses him and 'bewitches' him. Thomasina discovers him after a terrible night and he is naked and feverish. He babbles deliriously, then dies. In that moment, Thomasina is accused of being a witch by the twins, however, she also tells them that the family's black billy-goat - called Black Philip has been talking to the twins. Their father locks all of them in the goat shed whilst he buries his son and considers going back to the plantation /community for help. It is at this point, after much slow burn and build up that the film gains a greater pace. The mother 'sees' her precious dead children returned to her and 'breastfeeds' her lost baby. Unbeknown to her, a raven pecks at her breast, leaving it bloodied. The father then wakes up and goes to see how the children in the goat shed are. He finds the goat shed destroyed and the black goat running wild. The black goat then goads him repeatedly and painfully and he dies. Then the mother accuses Thomasina of sin and tries to kill her. Thomasina then kills her mother by stabbing. There is nothing left in the farm for Thomasina. Her father is dead, her mother dead, her brother has died of fever (presumably) and its not known what has happened to the twins. It is at this point, that it is likely that Thomasina will die too of hunger, exposure or madness. Thomasina withdraws to the goat shed following Black Philip. She asks Black Philip to speak to her as he did to the twins. Almost at the point of giving up, Black Philip answers and tells her how to get the things she wants - in this case the taste of butter (being properly fed) and a pretty dress (being a Puritan, wearing pretty dresses was considered vain and sinful). Black Philip tells her to remove her clothing (a bit of a cliché) and sign the book offered (presumably, offering her soul to the devil in exchange for a better life - again a cliché). He also helps her to sign it. This is at the point where the film enters superstitious nonsense territory. I shall not disclose any more of that as it belongs to the realms of nonsense in the vein of Denis Wheatley Hammer House of Horror film. It is the only part of the film which let it down, unfortunately. If you watch this film as an attempt to portray witchcraft in a realistic light, I wouldn't bother. You ain't going to find that here. As a fictional account in which superstition, isolation and religious mania can play havoc with the mind, it excels in that nicely. Lots of symbolism abounds in this film, from ravens, goats, hares and the use of colour within the forest (the 'witch' has a red cloak). Much of the symbolism is about suppressed lust having no outlet within a religious household. The presence of the 'witch' as an older woman naked and milking one of the goats is loaded with metaphor and symbolism. It is not a particularly horrific film. There are some shocks and surprises but nothing really jumpy, just a slow burn.",954,9,9,True

Basically set in the 17th century (the 1630s), a New England family: William (Ralph Ineson), his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Morgan's Anya Taylor-Joy), young son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), are banished from a Puritan plantation over a religious dispute. Near a large, secluded forest, the family build a farm, there Katherine gives birth to a son, Samuel (twins Axtun Henry and Athan Conrad Dube). One day, Thomasin is playing peekaboo with Samuel, during which the baby suddenly vanishes without trace. It is revealed that a red-cloaked Witch (Bathsheba Garnett) has stolen the unbaptized Samuel, that night she kills him and uses his blood and fat to make a flying ointment. A devastated Katherine spends the next few days crying and praying, while William insists it was a wolf that took the baby away. Katherine forbids the children from going into the forest, but William takes Caleb into the woods to lay a trap to catch an animal for food. Caleb asks his father if Samuel's soul will go to Heaven, William disciplines Caleb for asking this question and later reveals to his son that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the missing cup, and implies that Thomasin was responsible for Samuel's vanishing. After the children go to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family. Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check the trap in the forest, she threatens to wake up their parents unless she goes with him. While walking in the woods, they spot a rabbit near the trap, suddenly the horse Bert panics and the dog Fowler promptly chases the rabbit, Caleb runs after them, while Thomasin is thrown off the horse and knocked unconscious. Caleb gets lost in the woods and stumbles upon the dog's disembowelled corpse, going deeper into the wood he comes across a hovel, a beautiful young woman (Sarah Stephens) emerges from it and seduces him. William finds Thomasin and takes her home, Katherine is angry at Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods, while William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's silver cup to save Thomasin. Caleb is found outside in the rain that night, naked and delirious from an unknown illness, when he wakes up next day, he vomits a bloody apple, Katherine believes this to be witchcraft, Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft, their older sister had previously teased them pretending she is a witch, so she retaliates and tells the parents that the twins were having conversations with Black Phillip, the black goat. In rage, William puts both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house, boarding it up, he plans to return to the plantation the next day. That night, the elderly and hideous witch enters naked into the stable and drinks milk from the goats, the twins and Thomasin are terrified. Katherine has a haunting vision Caleb holding Samuel, in it she takes the baby and breastfeeds him, this is fact a dream, it is a black raven pecking at her bare and bloody breast. William wakes up the next day to find the stable destroyed, the goat mutilated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin with blood on her hands. As Thomasin wakes up, the black goat starts charging at William, impaling him with one of his horns. The commotion wakes Katherine, she is unhinged and blames Thomasin for all the recent tragedies that have beset the family and tries to strangle her, in self-defence Thomasin kills her with a billhook. Alone, Thomasin enters the stable and urges Black Phillip to speak to her, the goat appears to ask her if she would like to ""live deliciously"", then transforms into a tall dark man. The figure orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears, she says she does not know how to sign her name so Black Phillip helps her to do so. Now naked, Thomasin follows Black Phillip, back in goat-form, into the forest, she sees a coven of witches holding a Witches' Sabbath around a bonfire. She joins the coven as they begin to levitate, laughing and convulsing, Thomasin goes catatonic, and ascends above the trees, disappearing into the darkness. Also starring Julian Richings as Governor and Daniel Chaudhry as the voice of Black Phillip. Taylor-Joy gives a terrific performance as the adolescent going through many emotions brought on by horrific incidents, Ineson often does TV voiceovers and is impressive as the put-upon father, and Dickie does well also. This is not necessarily a terrifying watch, there are no real jump scares, it is certainly tense, with some darkly strange moments, while the use of drab colouring, and the choral score by Mark Korven add to the atmosphere, and the themes of grief, suspicion and hysteria work well, it is a most interesting alternative kind of period supernatural horror.

The Witch is being touted as a movie with pure, unrelenting dread. While that is the case at times, the atmosphere dwindles during the many times the characters repent. And they repent an awful, awful lot. I understand that the movie is about a family's faith being torn apart from within, but the movie's 'entertainment value' dips during some of those scenes. The tension is killed the moment they start bickering and doubting one another. It's just as one might expect, however, the Devil (evil) is a whisper in your ear which creates doubt with one's faith. And that is just what The Witch is, it's a whisper of evil. There are swift, small build ups that tease there is evil afoot, but just when you expect something sinister to occur, nothing. The hare, the goat, the raven (all heavy symbolism of Satanism) are all present.

The rookie director makes one huge mistake after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie when he shows that the witch is indeed real.

But the major flaw of this movie is that it simply isn't scary, the one defining characteristic of a horror movie. The pacing is glacial. And a slow horror movie is fine if you're building to some payoff. But no, the movie sort of trundles along without any real excitement. When we do get nearer to the end there are two climactic moments that weren't scary, but funny, I assume unintentionally so. The main character's little brother has what seems like an epiphany on his death bed which was so over the top it almost felt campy.

""The Witch"" is a painstaking recreation of Puritan life in New England. The lifestyle is mimicked. The clothes are period-accurate. The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It's as if Mel Gibson decided to update ""The Passion of the Christ"" by 1600 years. As mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until... okay, no spoilers. See the movie. This is a dark and effective movie. I can't remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to ""get"" me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won't lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster's ""Hereditary,"" if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end. That being said, the film isn't perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it's perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It's kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are. ""The Witch"" is quite an achievement and I'm glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking ""The Lighthouse.""

They all look, talk and act in a far distant culture, that sets you really in other world of possibilities, knowing for true that the forces involved in the development of the movie were just undisputed.

There hasn't been a horror film like this in a very long time. Any horror buff will agree that this film is a valuable gem in an underestimated genre. I had very high expectations on this film before seeing it, and it bargains much more than I expected, in which is highly rare nowadays. The film takes place many years before the Salem Witch trials and it starts off with a Puritan family leaving a plantation, due to disagreement beliefs. They find good size piece of land that is outside of a dark forest and built themselves a cabin and a farm. Once their newborn baby disappeared under the care of the post- adolescent daughter named Thomasin, things go downhill from there for the family. Crops of corn go bad, no luck on hunting food, and an ongoing grudge between Thomasin and her mother Katherine. Things get much worse when they sense evil is coming from the forest and the only thing that can save them are prayers and faith. But, for how long? The first thing that brought to my attention is the dialogue. It is an awesome idea that director and writer, Robert Eggers,had wrote it and execute it this way. It feels like we're seeing a prequel of the Crucible (I never saw the movie, but I've read the book. Unsure if the Winona Ryder film followed the original writing). Next, the atmosphere felt very authentic. You can sense absolute no civilization around the family and the cool, damp, New England weather, even though it was filmed in Canada. Third, the acting is tremendous! Nothing was campy, cheesy, or off. They felt like legit pilgrims on the screen. The father, played by Ralph Ineson, is my personal favorite character in the movie. It felt like I was watching a young Donald Sutherland. And last, but not least, the fear factor. It's intense. This film shows no mercy to the victims and to the viewers. There aren't that many casual jump-scares like in your everyday horror flicks, but just gives you a psychological fear that makes you highly uncomfortable. The fear just gradually builds up throughout the plot rather than spurts of scares here and there. It feels like a nightmare that you can't wake up from. After watching the movie, it makes you just speechless. If you a huge horror fan that wants something completely fresh without the cliché, The Witch is for you. After you watch it, you can't stop talking about it. It's that good. Robert Eggers did such a fantastic job and will be a household name of horror such as Stephen King, George A. Romero, Guillermo del Toro and Sam Raimi. this maybe too soon say this because we're in February, but I believe that this is the best horror movie of the year.

It wants to make a horror movie that is slow and creepy with vague illusions to things without having to hammer them home to the audience. On the flip side of that it can be too slow. Sometimes it feels like there is too much dead air in between the plot. It doesn't really work to build tension it just shows them preforming normal tasks. It's a marvel to look at and really has a amazing fee while watching it. It's creepy and weird. It does sort of get a little tangled up in its self by the end and becomes a little bit isolating because it is known back and forward by the writer but the audience doesn't have that privilege which is why I think it would benefit from more than one watch.,143,5,4,False

imdb_the_witch_dcarsonhagy_20160516,The Witch,IMDb,dcarsonhagy,2016-05-16,7,Religious Madness,"I finally was able to catch this film On-Demand last evening. Since it did not play in my town--as most types of these films NEVER do--I waited patiently for its availability. ""The Witch"" is a tale set in New England around 1630. A Puritan family has been banished from their local town because it seems the father was teaching religion that was in direct conflict with what was widely believed in this area. The family ventures out into the wilderness to restart their lives. Little do they know of the horror that waits. I have read many other IMDb reviews and I can see how this film can be loved AND how it can be hated. Several scenes seemed incomplete. There are incidences that just do not make sense, i.e. the abduction of the baby by the Witch. Why did they not search for the child? Who was the Witch? Did she really exist? It is only until much later in the film that (I think) someone references the baby was taken by a wolf. I am still puzzled over the final scene, which I will not reveal. I thought the acting was superb; however, I will say (again) that when you do a period piece with heavy British brogue, I just wish closed captioning was available. I had so much trouble understanding what was being said that it actually took my attention away from what was happening on screen. Anya Taylor-Joy is remarkable in her portrayal of the oldest daughter, Thomasin. Ralph Ineson plays the father, William very effectively, while Kate Dickie (who plays the mother, Katherine) proves she can wail with the best of them. The music and cinematography were both exceptional. Director Robert Eggers seems to know his way about the camera! While this movie was billed as ""horror,"" to me it is simply a tale about what religion and all its trappings can do to even the strongest of minds. There is some real tension here, and it was very refreshing to see a horror movie that was actually character driven. Rated ""R"" for violence and nudity--and NONE of it graphic--""The Witch"" is definitely a cut above most movies of its kind. However, I will caution any potential viewer to be aware of the pace and the accents. The movie is a little slow, and I've already stated what I felt about the heavy British brogues.

I have been very disappointed in the majority of new horror releases for a while now. I had really high hopes for this film and it did not disappoint. Now, this film is not for everyone. Either you will love it or hate it. I feel there is no in between. The complaint most had with the film was the dialect. This is a little jarring at first but you will get used to it. It's a period piece set during 1630 in New England and I can appreciate the authenticity. A lot of research was done in making this film including reviewing documents of this period in time. It really shows and you will transported to this place and time. Also, you get a real sense of the consequences of religious fanaticism. You understand how difficult it must have been for someone who had been labeled as evil and how easily it could have happened. Every difficulty and hardship was instantly blamed on an evil presence which in itself is scary. At first, I was unsure if what was happening was real or imagined by the film's characters and this was very effective. The acting was spot on and some of the best I've seen in a horror film since I don't know when. You can feel each characters struggle and in the end their utter hopelessness. The whole atmosphere of the film was of desperation and despair. It does build slowly increasing the tension and suspense which a good horror film should do. The score was excellent and added to the suspense. The film overall had a disturbing and unsettling vibe to it that I found hard to shake even after leaving the theater. I immediately was reminded of The Shining in the overall feel and look of the movie. It also felt somewhat like a dark fairy tale. If your easily bored this is not the film for you. It will require your full attention. There were people actually leaving in the middle of the showing when I saw it. But I was transfixed and memorized in a way I haven't been in a long time. It was as if I was watching something I shouldn't be but could not make myself look away. There are no jump scares, tons of gore, or typical horror clichés. And if your're not a fan of period pieces this might not be your thing either. I think if a person is open and willing to tolerate the dialect, you will see it for the masterpiece it is. This was storytelling at it's absolute best. It's dark and disturbing, just what I like my horror to be. BTW, if someone plans to write a negative review on this film or any other for that matter, please do not say ""I want this period of time in my life back"". That's not original nor clever and completely overused. It should be banned from anyone's review IMO. This is even put in the title at times so please just stop.",523,14,12,False
imdb_the_witch_sddavis63_20181021,The Witch,IMDb,sddavis63,2018-10-21,6,This Would Have Been A Better Horror Movie Without The Supernatural Angle,"At first, I thought this was going to be a kind of a rehash of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village."" It does sound very similar: a group of people living at the edge of a forest in primitive conditions start to believe that there's something in the woods out to get them. In this case, they believe there's a witch, or even the devil. But, although this has more of a supernatural element than Shyamalan's movie, in some respects it also has a more authentic feeling. This movie really is set in the 17th century. An apparently strict Puritan family, recently arrived at a plantation colony in the New World from England, is banished from the colony because of their religious beliefs. They take up residence in a clearing, with only themselves for company and without the protection of the colony, and with the dark and mysterious forest right beside them, and tragedies start to befall them almost immediately - beginning with the death of the infant son. The family seems divided into various alliances, for lack of a better word: mother and father, older brother and sister, and younger brother and sister. All of them are impacted by the baby's death in a variety of ways, but it's the eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) who becomes the target. She had been caring for the baby when it disappeared. Gradually, as things continue to spiral downhill for the family, Thomasin is suspected of having made a deal with the devil; of being a witch - with results that are ultimately tragic. There is an authentic feel to this. There were fears of witches in the early-mid 17th century, and especially in New England. There were isolated families, in a strange new land, not knowing for sure what lurked in the forests that weren't very far away. Many were hyper-religious. They were inclined to see Satan at work when hardship befell them. They did turn on each other - many of the ""witch"" accusations that were made in the era were started by children making up stories that got out of hand because the adults took them seriously. So I actually could buy into this story. I actually could feel sympathy for poor Thomasin as the accusations against her from her own family spiralled out of control. And the performances in this from everyone really were very good. In addition to the sympathy I felt for Thomasin, I was intrigued by the character of William, the father (played by Ralph Ineson.) Yes, he was a strict and hyper-religious Puritan, obsessed with sin and fearful (or at least uncertain about) his eternal fate. But there was also a strangely compassionate nature about William. He did love his family - often very tenderly, kind of turning the traditional stereotype of the strict Puritan father on its head. It was a very good performance. I thought that director Robert Eggers also did a very good job. The movie was filmed in a very isolated location in northern Ontario, and Eggers used the location to great advantage, right down to using only natural lighting, which added to the atmosphere of the movie. He also insisted on using English actors, supposedly so that the accents would be authentic - notwithstanding the fact that the English of the early 17th century probably had a different sound than a modern English accent. And yet, ultimately this disappointed me. The story does, in fact, go for a supernatural ending, as Thomasin, who emerges as the last survivor of the family after killing her own mother while her mother was trying to kill her, does in fact make a deal with the devil (who's represented in the movie by a black goat the family has named Black Phillip.) Ultimately, she ends up joining a coven of witches deep in the forest, with the last scene showing all of them levitating. Perhaps this may seem strange, but I thought that last scene weakened the worth of this as a horror movie. For me, the actions and thoughts of real human beings are far more chilling than supernatural silliness, and the horror of this movie was really the slow buildup of paranoia as we watched the family turn on each other, blaming each other for things that could well have just been natural tragedies. No devil or witches needed, in other words. The ending came across as just silly to me, and detracted from rather than summing up everything that had come before. But that last scene aside, I can't deny that I enjoyed this movie. It was a reasonable look (the ending notwithstanding) at something that could very well have happened in that era and in that context. (6/10)",788,8,9,True

While the cinematography and atmosphere are well done, they don't make up for the lack of engagement in the story. The film tries to build tension through unsettling music and old English dialogue, but it only makes things feel even slower. The horror elements are minimal, and the ending, while eerie, doesn't feel satisfying after such a long buildup. I kept waiting for something intense to happen, but it never did.

If one disregards supernatural elements at work, the picture offers a study of a 1630's era family about to experience dysfunction at a most catastrophic level. By holding a faith in God as their only rationale to exist, virtually every moment in the life of William (Ralph Ineson) and wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) offers an occasion for sin. Their concern for their children is claustrophobic, which eventually leads the siblings to turn on each other via accusations of conspiring with the devil and witches. What catapults the story into the realm of horror is the sudden, and I would consider, almost impossible disappearance of baby Samuel, who's departure from sister Thomasin's ( Anya Taylor-Joy) watchful gaze occurs so instantaneously that one would have to question what mechanism could have been so responsible. The story builds from there as events spiral into a frenzy of grievous misunderstandings and accusations, until Thomasin becomes the only survivor of a demonic evil that alternately takes form in that of a red haired witch, a hideous old hag and a bad tempered goat named Black Phillip. Alternatively, one might, by virtue of the film's closing moments, determine that the destruction perpetrated on the banished wilderness family was caused by a demonic cult practicing their black magic in the deep cover of the family farm's neighboring woods.

Set in colonial times in America, the story is one of a family that is exiled from a village. The family chooses to settle near the woods in which many strange things occur, the first being the disappearance of the baby of the family. The eldest daughter of the family is cautious when it comes to the woods, but that doesn't mean she can't get good fun out of teasing her little sister that she is the infamous witch of the woods. This little sister and her twin brother take this jest too seriously, and eventually inform their parents of this incident. That being said, supernatural forces are at play among the family at the core of the movie, and tensions are raised and the family members are against each other as possible demons. Some may find trouble keeping up with the Old English used in the film, but it seems easy enough to understand when you compare it to Shakespeare's works (even with modern adaptations such as Whedon's ""Much Ado About Nothing""). The person who uses this type of the language the most is the father, William, played by Ralph Ineson. Ineson steals the show even when the audience cannot fully comprehend what he is saying (it is easy to get the general idea though). His performance is probably one of the best aspects of this film, other than the lack of great color variety that truly sets the mood for this film. In terms of ""horror"" films, this movie does not produce many jump scares, and is instead just disturbing in content, making it comparable to films like The Shining or perhaps Rosemary's Baby. With the family accusing each other, elements of The Thing also come into play.

As a horror veteran, tired of the same generic haunted house garbage we get month after month, year after year, I am so happy to write that Robert Eggings brings us a film that transcends all expectations and clichés. The Witch is a palpable breath of fresh air for horror; or rather, a forced serving of black bile poured down your throat to churn inside your stomach and send shivers down to your soul. Even if, and I am certain of it, nothing here will be noticed by such a sanitized society like the Academy or an immature audience seeking cheap thrills, the fact remains that everything on display in The Witch is of master-class craftsmanship. The choice of 1.66 : 1 aspect ratio, a highly subtle effect, is most likely responsible for much of the film's highlights and weaves a strongly claustrophobic environment. Many of the shots are close-ups on characters' faces or characters' backs, a technique that seems to be gaining popularity as shown by last year's phenomenal Son of Saul. The camera rarely expands beyond the intimacy of our characters' personal spaces and this creates a sense of attachment and empathy wherein the viewer experiences a feeling of active participation rather than safe and casual outside observance. The gray and murky autumnal environment is succinctly rich in flavor which accentuates on the film's aesthetic of a ""folk tale"". The sky is ever overcast, and the trees in the woods are all stripped of leaves, remaining tall imposing husks that are easy to get lost in. The aesthetic and environment are almost like characters themselves in The Witch, hearkening back to Eastern European tales of the macabre, the Grimm Brothers, or Nikolai Gogol. And like a classical folk tale, subtlety is key here; you will find no obnoxious jump- scares or cheap gore here. The heavy immersion power of The Witch is pulled along by the small cast of characters who luckily, are mostly unknown. I personally recognized no one besides Kate Dickie from Game of Thrones but this was nothing distracting. It is easier to sympathize with people whose faces you aren't familiar with, rather than thinking to yourself, ""wow, Leo is doing great work here"". This holds immersion for the viewer, and because the cast was enormously talented, nothing broke that immersion or tension. The 17th century script the cast works with is written with great care and effort and remains understandable and relatable, creating no barriers between the film and the audience. There is a lot more I can comment on, but this is a spoiler-free review. For any comment in regards to story, I can say that the way the story is presented is an extremely tense family drama, punctuated by brain-searing sequences of horror. Robert Eggers, for a debut film, shows total command and mastery of the genre he presents, and plays all the cards right. The sensation of horror is crafted through just enough lingering on certain imagery, and just enough glimpses of the horrific and supernatural to make a world of difference between a competent period piece horror, and one of the most disturbing films of the 21st century.",548,6,6,False

This is a work of love, and a product of years of very elaborate and tedious research into the historical context and origins of the concept, and the frame of mind of Puritans that made their primitive prejudices possible. The movie also skillfully touches on the related widespread folklore, that gave rise to the stories from brothers Grim to contemporary Disney rendering of the witches universe. But though there are many layers of interpretation of the movie, it is really in essence an exploration of the primitive Puritan imagination, that made supernatural interpretation out of even the most mundane occurrences, let alone the unexpected ones. This is the place filled with ominous witches, where sin is rampant, where Puritan oppression - sexual and otherwise - can find outlet in fantasy, leading to atrocities and abuse of all sorts. And this is the true horror, the truly scary thing about the whole thing. For, the medieval puritan mindset of New England and their folk tales of witches might be things of the past, but bigotry and close minded stupidity and prejudice are alive and well, especially in America. Salem witch trials and executions are long gone, but bigotry still gives rise to savage acts in the name of ""spreading democracy"", ""fighting terrorism"" or ""communism"", and to the unchecked USA atrocities all over the world. The origins of this horrifying, bigoted mindset are well explored in this movie. It is not supernatural elements that are appalling, but the palpable reality of human stupidity and wickedness of the nature of humans and their ""righteousness"", that is really the root of truly sublime horror.",326,15,14,False

There's no gore, jumpscares, or set formula of cast or events. It is, however, a work of art well-cared for by its creators. The setting, costumes, acting, writing, and directing make for a film firmly set in our very real history, with people's very real fears and anxieties manifest beautifully in a tense, dark atmosphere. This film hit me a certain way that others may or may not experience. I'm an avid amature historian, with an upbringing with both devout Christianity and a mentally unstable (sometimes abusive) parent, so relating to the characters' plights, especially Thomasin's, came easily. The characters were well written and shaped, and all of them seemed to have an important place in the story. Except maybe Jonas. He didn't have much screentime or development, but whatever. The writing is excellent, with perfect period dialogue and well-paced scenes, though the overall story did seem a little rushed, and the last scene was just a bit too out there to mesh well with the rest of the film. The costumes were perfect, and the monochrome motif of the film didn't feel forced or exaggerated. None of the film did, really. It just flowed it's own way, not worrying about being too action-heavy or scary. Certain scenes were disturbing, but didn't overstay their welcome, and things weren't spelled out for you at any point. It makes you think, it makes you wonder why, how, and what. There's not a lot wrong with this film, except for it's misbranding as a horror movie. Yes, technically it is horror, but it's a calm type of horror that you often don't see anymore.

It is not a traditional horror film, and really, the only apt comparison I can come up with is Eggers' other major film, The Lighthouse, mixed with a bit of Midsommar. Regardless, it is an awesome film. Eggers' writing and direction, combined with perfect acting and an immersive set design, create a chilling tale that stands out among modern horror. First off, the acting. Wow. Each actor in this film is incredible, despite half of the cast being child actors. And I don't mean good acting, when you are watching and think, ""that actor is doing great right now"". I was not even registering that they were actors at all, I was so immersed. And their colonial dialect was authentic yet understandable, and seemed to be spoken completely naturally, which is often difficult to pull off. Each character became paranoid or corrupted throughout the film, creating a suspenseful tone that lasted the whole movie. I would like to specifically recognize Ralph Ineson, as the tormented, prideful, authoritative, and increasingly uncontrolled father. His performance stood out among an impressive cast as one of the best I've seen in horror. Of course, this acting would be nothing without the writing that make this so convincing. Using writings from the period, Eggers makes the dialogue feel real, not like our interpretation of how they sounded. And the progression of the film makes it feel like a ""slow burn"" movie, yet so many events are put into the 92 minute film, that it is constantly entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. The exploration of the themes of paranoia, corruption, and religion are obvious, but not thrown in your face. The viewer will ""get it"", but not feel like it's just been entirely handed to them. The set design and direction compliment the other factors in making a complete atmosphere for this film. The farm is shabby and poor, and in seemingly every shot, you can see the weak, unappealing crops, a subtle reminder of the coming desperation of the family. The woods loom over them ominously, never easing the feeling of dread and mystery. The movie is mostly lit by candlelight and features many close up shots of the characters, which outside of showcasing their acting chops, also keeps the viewer in the same position as the characters: wondering what will happen next. All in all, The Witch is a stunningly suspenseful film, immersive in all aspects. Much like other A24 horror films, it is not something you can shake off right after viewing.

For me the VVitch was about temptation and evil. All of these stories strongly connect with good acting by your characters, especially the character you begin to relate to. In the VVitch the eldest daughter Thomason is the focus. As the story progresses we can relate to her. The puritan lifestyle pretty much sucks. It's a hard life riddled with guilt and tedium. As she begins to realize the evil out in the woods she is drawn to it. The director gives us very shocking glimpses of this evil to let us know it is real but the witches are not the focus of the story.

imdb_the_witch_williamotyler_20160228,The Witch,IMDb,WilliamOTyler,2016-02-28,10,Horrifically Enchanting,"The Witch, following a family upon their move into the wilderness of 1630s New England, is the debut feature film from director Robert Eggers who embeds the project with an essence of horror not often seen. While many audiences are busy looking for, or even lazily just waiting for, big jumps and stingers for their scares like most modern movies of the genre, they are missing the creepy details that truly push a slow burn like this film into horror. It's so realistically done that you worry that it shouldn't be happening, and are likewise worried of the consequences for the family. The ensemble cast is first and foremost in bringing this story to life. The acting is just incredible. You can see heavy breath leaving the body. You can see the confusion in their eyes. You can see evil determination and quiet despair. Each actor has a moment of triumph where their talent alone is on display, and these scenes hit like a goat to the gut. What makes it even more impressive is that more than half of the main cast is made up of child actors that pull these feats from who knows where. They are eerily effective in a way that, at one point, I questioned whether one of the children was actually an adult acting through motion capture. It was not the case. The acting is just that intense and believable. Other points and aspects of the film also make you question everything you're seeing. Has any of this story been real? Is what is happening in this story being imagined? There's a sense of ambiguity that, instead of making things more comfortable because it's probably just an old-timey urban legend, actually makes you more hesitant to step further into darkness because it could very well be real. While those horrific voices help make up a vivid and powerful score by Mark Koven, could these chants actually be coming from nearby evil as well? The forest, already a naturally dangerous place, is left open to become a supernatural place of folklore where any animal you encounter could be something more and the tall trees creep in close to overcome you. It's a masterful choice to shoot this film in more of a full frame aspect ration, which makes its presentation alone feel old and classic, purposefully dated to a time long since experienced. At the same time, it subconsciously makes the film about a tight-knit family go completely claustrophobic and uncomfortable, even when outdoors. It's isolating. The camera is used like a lullaby, going back and forth between sweeps across plains and utter stillness until it trances you into the unknown. There is depth and uneasiness in every frame, and bewilderment after every turn. Takes that last longer than expected leave you to breathe during these down times, but there really is no downtime when you're numbed into a sense of wonder. All of this culminates into a film that floats into a state of euphoria, capturing an emotion that you may not have known was even there before. It's a witch film unlike any witch film you've seen, taken seriously and realistically, but with a climate of dread. It's a slice of life film, really, albeit a slice of an alternative life. As familiar in storybooks as it might be today, these were the absolute thoughts and stories passed around by those who lived during the time, the stories that many thought to be real.

Plenty of films claim historic accuracy, but you rarely see it. Mel Gibson is notorious for his pseudo historical (but highly entertaining) historical fiction movies. The Witch, though a semi-low budget horror film, puts those to shame. Listen to what the director says about his attention to detail. ""I am positive it is the most accurate portrayal of this period in American history on screen. We went to such lengths to make it so,"" writer-director Robert Eggers told the LA Times earlier this year. ""Everything with the farmstead that we built, everything that you see on-screen is made from the correct building materials that would have been used at the time. Most often we used the traditional tools and techniques to create these objects. And the clothing is hand stitched based on extant clothing."" OK, except the nails, which are round and not square like they would have been in the seventeenth century. Nitpickers have also gone after the filmmaker's stylized title. Cinema Sins' claim that the digraph ""VV"" fell out of use after the sixteenth century (The Witch is set in the seventeenth century), and therefore the stylized use of VV in the title is inaccurate, is only partly true. The Wonders of the Invisible World by Cotton Mather, published in 1693, clearly shows witch spelled with a digraph. However, it is a ""double U,"" or UU. Several other pamphlets, shown here, from 1643 and 1645, both show witch spelled ""V Vitch,"" just like the film title. Printing at the time was more art than science, and printers chose when to use the modern W or the older VV or UU. Even the witch lore is highly accurate to the seventeenth century, from using baby's blood as flying ointment, to enchanted animals cursing weapons in order to slip away unharmed. And, of course, writing one's name in blood in the Devil's book, creepily portrayed by a black goat. Witches were believed to cause their victims to vomit foreign objects, shown when the family's son, Caleb is being tormented and spits up an apple. There are no magic wands, pointy hats, or broomsticks here. Witches represented a malevolent force in the natural and social order, destroying relationships between neighbors and family members. In The Witch, tragedies and minor transgressions gradually unravel the family and undermine the trust that held them together. The tension is palpable as they slowly turn on each other, all while apparently under supernatural assault. The terror comes from knowing this threat destroys from within as well as from without. In many ways The Witch reminds me of Eyes of Fire (1983), in which a group of religious dissenters flee to the wilderness only to face assault by supernatural forces in colonial New England. There's something primordial about the hostility of nature, survival, and the union of wood and spirit. The idea that nature is foreign and hostile to man appeals to our basest instincts. I'm not sure I'd agree with Jay from RedLetterMedia that The Witch is the best film to hit theaters in 2016, but it's definitely the best horror movie to come out for a while. It's an incredible first film for writer-director Robert Eggers. I just hope he isn't another M.

There is an elegance in the simplicity of the tale however and in that simple elegance it does find its place. This is much more of an insidious, psychological thriller rather than any sort of in your face horror film. Set in the time of Puritans in New England we initially see a man William being banished from a village because their religious beliefs aren't, for lack of a better word, puritanical enough. His family and him find a place to build a farm and build a life worshiping God the way they see fit. The family is William, the Father, Katherine, the Mother and five children the oldest of which is Thomasin, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. Thomasin is our defacto protagonist and most of the action is framed through her perspective. Taylor-Joy in her first major role really captivates when she is on the screen and is the true revelation of the picture. When the youngest child goes missing things at the household steadily start to unravel. Are there evil entities in the woods that would do them harm? Is Thomasin the real threat? Soon the whole family is turning on one another as secrets reveal themselves, and through it all a paranormal threat looms. We as the audience are treated to snippets of this supernatural threat.

The low score on this movie and equally horrifying reviews is a great injustice for this exquisite piece of art. The movie takes place in 1630's New England the family gets banished from the plantation and have to fend for themselves in the harsh conditions of this brave new world. The story of this film is nothing new, it's mainly based off of folklore that is told during that era. Where the story intentionally lacks from, the characters more than make up for it. The character interactions, their desires and their perceived flaws are absolutely on point. And anyone who studied and learned about Puritans to some degree would enjoy its authenticity. They come alive with their mannerism and their way of thinking. Their relationship with god, religion, and family really help drive it home that these are real human beings. People who would consider this movie to be bad, would say the same thing about Lovecraft stories. They would scoff at Twin Peaks for not being scary enough. In a world with endless, low brow horror sequels, this movie exceeds every expectation and delivers the much needed fresh air that horror fans were suffocating for. It is disturbing, uncomfortable, even grotesque at times with its subject matter and imagery. It manages to keep the tension up throughout the movie with its incredible score and cinematography. It's a rare thing to be impressed by a movie this much, and I'm so glad I had the privilege to experience this awe and respect I had for the movie, even hours after viewing it. I gave this movie 10/10 because the current score is an insult to everyone who appreciates good cinema, and according to the masses an experience is either worth one star, or ten starts.

The Witch has good ideas running through it but they are poorly executed. The majority of the time I felt like I was waiting for something to actually happen. People explain this as being tension, I explain it as being boring and underwhelming. Not once was I scared or felt tense. When something did actually happen it just wan't done very well. The acting wasn't as bad as in Babadook but it was certainly questionable. There were moments where I had to cringe at how bad the acting was.

I actually feel this is an ""important"" film for Christians and just about anyone else to see ... and I don't say that about most movies. The movie was extremely realistic, and just fascinating. It was also beautifully filmed, had a great score, and the casting was spot-on as well. The family was a typical ""Calvinist (aka Reformed Christian)"" family and if one understands Calvinism before watching the film, one will get a great deal more out of it I believe. Please note, I am NOT a Calvinist and consider Calvinism to be almost entirely unBiblical. I even asked my own children to watch this movie and afterwards we had a wonderful discussion and Bible study as the film deals with a great many spiritual issues and is a perfect film to discuss afterwards. One of the things that has always bugged me about many so-called ""spiritual"" movies is that they show Christians getting ""possessed"" when such is literally impossible. This movie did not do that and I truly appreciated such. Instead it showed devilish attacks and the like, but not actual ""possession"", at least not until and unless a character actually desired such, which is Biblically accurate.

This film was intense and very disturbing but in in my opinion it could have been a little better. I wanted this film to be straight up scary but it wasn't. I think the writer/director wanted to focus more on how the family was breaking apart due to the evil that was surrounding them instead of focusing more on the evil itself, which I'm not mad at because it made this film different and a little more interesting.

A slow-burning, subtle and reserved experience that lets you resonate with the characters and really experience the unraveling of their family unit. What really makes this film special is that there's so many things that it could've very easily done wrong, but handled every aspect with class, tact and respect. The term 'Scary' means something different for everybody, so deeming this film as ""un-scary"" does not mean a thing, I will say though that this film goes beyond just 'being scary', it's not that kind of film. It's much more unsettling and unnerving, getting under your skin rather than being overtly frightening or gory. Frights last a moment, but the ability to not only get under you skin, but linger there is a mark of a truly great horror film. It's a story about losing faith, it's a story about guilt and how those things can tear a family apart. For those wanting a 'fire and brimstone' monster feature, you'll be sorely disappointed. This film is much more in the vein of masters like Stanley Kubrick, Ingmar Bergman with even a touch of Andrei Tarkovsky. It's amazingly and intimately well crafted and shot, scored, acted and researched. It takes its time to tell the characters' stories, but does so with a strange, otherworldly and totally supernatural feel. It's just as effective as an intense drama as it is a horror film. This is the kind of horror film that will be discussed for years to come, and only comes around once in a blue moon. I don't want to give away anything in this review, but I will say this: For those that really enjoy the art of film, storytelling, character building and the craft in general, believe the hype. It's excellent. But for those expecting a gory and fun, cartoonishly-satanist and jump-scare littered monster flick, stay away and don't ruin it for the others trying to enjoy their theater-going experience. You'll end up not enjoying it or will find it to be a tedious and boring watch. Even though at a trim 90 minutes, if you find it boring, you have no attention span whatsoever, but that's besides the point. To cap it off, this is the kind of Horror film I'm always waiting for, especially considering the droves of wanton garbage that flood the theaters week after week, and after looking forward to the film for nearly a year and a half, I'm glad to say that it delivered on all fronts.

The movie is about a family of outcasts who try to maintain a living on their own, when natural elements are threatening their life (food, animals), but also their faith in God. Their faith is such a strong foundation and source of love, that when their faith is seemingly threatened, life and sanity start falling apart. And that is what this movie is about. A pretty natural reenactment of how life was in that period. The surrounding, the clothing, the acting, the lines are a very loyal representation of life and values in those times. That alone makes that the movie can feel like a thriller.

Above average period chiller with a vivid sense of place and time where a family is trapped on all sides by the elements. Not terribly accessible with its Jacobean dialogue (apparently its very authentic but I wouldn't know) and it almost gives the movie a comic tone but the substance shines through very disquietingly. On that note, the only language that really survives the test of time is recorded language so these characters are speaking in a way that people at the time mostly just wrote in so as admirable as the attempt at authentic speech is, it's probably a bad move both in theory and practice. If they had spoken more candidly and then I could have taken this a lot more seriously. Otherwise, there's none of the cheesiness or obnoxiousness that you might get in movies like The Conjuring, where sudden blasts of strings ruin what might have been a good reveal. We just gradually find in god's country forces that appear to be unholy (see what I did there?), captured in an unrushed, flavorsome, culturally rich fashion.

There is excruciating dread imbibed in his way of storytelling that makes it one of a kind. Eggers maintains a regular pace throughout the flick to milk our fears without going into the shoddy territory. We feast on some high quality filmmaking. The topic of witches has rarely ever touched such a tangible and lucid style of direction. You haven't experienced a disquiet quite like this before, and gore that throws you into fits of anxiety! Acts of witchcraft create a metaphor which is quite clamorous if you really pay heed. You cannot help but feel helpless, cannot stop feeling sorry for the characters entailed, by silently wishing them goodwill. But alas! this is one of the darkest movies ever made. So, if you have a feeble heart just be prepared mentally and you can bear the imminent. The Witch isn't exactly your average horror flick that tries to scare you with disappearing-appearing acts, or by messing around with the cameras, or via zooming in or zooming out effects. Au contraire, it is one of those purest forms of horror that is allowed to gradually develop in you, as you scale its frames right from the very beginning. Very engaging stuff that will leave you traumatized with abominable witch acts! You cannot help but marvel at the way Eggers captures his gorgeous frames. The serenity of the woods that he arrests in his frames icing it with a harrowing music in the background is beyond comparison. Captivating landscapes and natural shots that he takes make the movie a visual entertainer. You can almost read the tranquility of the woods through his endearing screens. The casting has been done brilliantly. Screenplay is smitten with Shakespearean English which some might find hard to understand. Music is very grim but just about perfect for a horror movie.

The setting/visuals. The time it was set, and the location on the edge of the woods makes for a great horror movie. One of the only problems with this movie is that it shouldn't really have been labeled a horror... although I'm not quite sure what would be a more accurate genre. Something psychological. Like ""The Shining"", but with much less of the scary/creepy visuals. (there are still some) It's more about a family's mental breakdown. The other problem I had was that yes, it is a little hard to understand the characters sometimes. The dad is the worst. I had trouble in the beginning but if you devote a little more of your attention to what they're saying it should help. My advice is, don't go in to it thinking you're seeing a run of the mill horror movie where your heart is pounding, wondering when the next jump scare is going to be. There's few, if any. (depending on how easily startled you are). Go in thinking you're going to see a well put together movie, with some psychological elements to it.

He dismisses those around him as false Christians, and the others claim that he speaks ill of the word of God. William's family includes his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), and baby Samuel. Having been banished from their New England plantation, they start a small farm in the wilderness. William and Katherine attempt to lead a devout Christian life, homesteading on the edge of an impassible wilderness, with five children. There the family is submitted to witchcraft, black magic and weird happenings. A New-England Folktale! . Evil Takes Many Forms !. It is told from the point of view of the teenager Thomasin, well played by the also debutant Anya Taylor-Joy, along with her other stars in the film: Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Grangier. It is Robert Eggers' first work as a director and writer of films, recreating the time before the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, a few years in which the fear of God reigned over New England, driving religious convictions to hysteria collective. In this terrifying film, the eternal concepts of witchcraft, black magic, and possession come together to tell the disintegration of a family settled in the New England countryside in the 18th century. When William's family is forced to settle in the countryside, strange things begin to happen: one of the children disappears, the crop fails, and the animals become aggressive. Suspicion and paranoia increase and the family accuses one of their members of witchcraft. Then circumstances worsen and the faith, loyalty, and affection of family members are put to the test in an inimitable way. To create the story and the characters, Eggers turned to his own memories, as he states: ¨I grew up in New England and since my early childhood, the past of the area has been part of my consciousness, witches have populated my nightmares. I wanted to create a story from horror to archetypal for New England, a bad dream that arises from the past, a film that transports the nightmare through a Puritan family, and at the same time, takes the viewer to the place where the witches are real and terrifying¨. The script is based on documents and court records from the 18th century, which allows Eggers to proceed an exhaustive reconstruction of the era, which took years to carry out research on the documentation about the daily life of the first English settlers, showing the traditions agricultural practices of the time in England and the changes they suffered upon arriving in North America. Everything that appears in the film was built with the materials and techniques available to a Puritan family at the time. Although mechanical saws and other modern tools were used to save time, what you see: the planks, roofs, nails are those that would have been used then. ¨The VVitch: A New-England Folktale (2015)¨ was highly applauded at its premiere at the 2015 Sundance Festival, where it won the prize for best director. The motion picture was professionally written and directed by Robert Houston Eggers and using his ordinary trademarks, such as : frequent use of longtakes, characters that live in some form of isolation, Christian noticeable roles with magical powers and pagan themes/symbolisms. Eggers is an American filmmaker and production designer. He is best known for writing and directing the historical horror films ¨The Witch¨ (2015) and ¨The Lighthouse¨ (2019), as well as directing and co-writing the historical fiction epic film ¨The Northman¨ (2022). His films are noted for its authenticity and for its adequacy to real facts with period pieces inspired by folklore from the locations the story is set in, as director Robert Eggers usually works with historians and doing meticulous research into the historical period.

It also wasn't the most complete experience for me because it does feel like there were moments where I felt like Eggers wanted to do more but because of the budget he couldn't. I do think his later films feel more filled to the brim. But I do think on rewatch there probably are new things to pick up on here and there.",197,2,1,False
imdb_the_witch_justynschwoegler_20160529,The Witch,IMDb,justynschwoegler,2016-05-29,10,The Best Horror Movie Since The Shining!,"Well some movies are a bit more haunting than others. The Witch is a Period Piece set in 1630's New England, American. It centers around family who moves out into the woods and suspects that there is a Witch that wants to hurt them. I'm just coming out honest that this movie is a 2016 Masterpiece in Psychological Horror. Let's start off with the acting. The Acting is amazing and each character fits their roles very well. There is also a lot of character development between the characters. The Mother played by Kate Dickie is the more sad character and you feel for her in her scenes. The two children played by Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger do very well for what they are given and are not that annoying as some other children in other horror movies. The Other Male Child played by Harvey Scrimshaw is amazing also for what he is given and really becomes his character later in the movie. Finally the two best characters were the father played by Ralph Ineson and the Oldest Child played by Anya Taylor-Joy are both fantastic characters and please watch out for them I bet there gonna be in some major titles soon (Anya Taylor-Joy is gonna be 2016's ""Morgan""). The Cinematography is top notch! Easily each and every shot in the film could be in a Art Museum. That's because there is a lot colors and depth to each and every shot which something we don't see in most films today. There are a lot of color schemes of Gray which work for what it is and is likable. Now the best part of the film is how scary it is? Umm... This Movie may just be the scariest movie ever made! There are tons of scenes with tension and lots of disturbing scenes (which I will not spoiler) throughout the film's run time. It also gives some time to think in between the disturbing scenes. Surprise! There is absolutely no Jump Scares in the film, the Film uses horrifying sounds, and disturbing images to scare the viewer to the bone. Also the Film oozes Atmosphere and tone which the tone feels like we really are watching something real and we shouldn't be watching it! In Conclusion, The Witch is a 21th Century Masterpiece and is my Favorite Film of the year. So do yourself a favor and go out, rent (or better yet buy) this Movie, Watch the movie with some friends, and live deliciously.",417,7,5,False

One expects some resolution of all this, some way to place the scattered parts in an overall pattern. Instead the drama intensifies but never with any real explanation of why, not even in the ending which is more the revelation of a secret than a satisying resolution to all the questions raised.

Cast - 10/10 pros: Anya Taylor-Joy is mesmerizing. Without her I think this film could have fallen apart. Ineson and Dickie provide some truly disturbing performances along side her. cons: nothing to list here, this is one of the major strengths of this film Direction - 8/10 pros: Eggers captures an unbelievable feel of despair and solitaire, reminiscence to Kubrick's work in the Shining. He is not afraid to take his time to create this sense of feeling. cons: possible he relied on superior filmmaking and didn't focus on story as much. Pace - 6/10 pros/cons: this is a tough one so listing pros and cons together here. This is a slow moving movie, a very slow moving movie, it can be tough to sit through, but at the same time that is one of it's major strengths; it's ability to make the audience squirm.

imdb_the_witch_genti27_20160913,The Witch,IMDb,Genti27,2016-09-13,10,Masterpiece of a film,"The Witch is a historical period horror movie written and directed by Robert Eggers in his directorial debut. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson. The movie's based on English folktales about a strictly religious family that encounters forces of evil in the woods near the place where they live. I personally believe that this film is a total masterpiece in every single aspect. From the great haunting visuals to the genius story told, this film is absolutely incredible. All the actors do a great job, especially Anya Taylor-Joy who is so talented and certainly has a bright future ahead of her. The tone of the film is brilliant and really scary to think about. The family was religious and had ""faith"" in God, but what they did not realize is that they did not have faith in one another and so that creates conflict and from conflict comes sin. Something which they are strongly against, and yet it consumes them entirely, sin is there deep down in their hearts and they could never escape it. The Witch is riddled with ideas that make you think and are chilling that will undeniably stick with you for quite a while after. It is such a well made film, from the smart lighting that reflects upon the characters to the suspenseful score composed by Mark Korven. My only issue is that it is a bit slow at times, but once you get into the characters and the story that is being told, it is a thrill ride from then on. The ending is also insane and frankly really scary too. I loved this film and I would recommend any horror and movie fan in general who just wants to see a masterpiece, to watch it now.",302,22,27,False

He highly recommended The Exorcist, but I've already seen that classic at least a few times. He also talked about The Witch and it made me curious, so I went to read a few reviews on IMDb or actually to skim-read them and focus mostly on review titles and the like-to-dislike ratio to the reviews that I considered are well-written by intelligent people. Many of the reviews that were glowing were hammered down by its readers. This made me very curious indeed. It's not often well-written reviews that are positive about a movie get trashed. I watched the movie yesterday (July 2, 2021), at night. No one around. It started off well, and what I noticed was a very good eye to detail, atmosphere, language, and storytelling. I was hooked. It wasn't exactly scary, but I'm rarely scared in life and certainly not by a movie. I'd like to be disturbed, though. This movie didn't do that, I'll be honest, but I appreciated the effort put into this work. It always managed to hold my eyes to the screen. I scratched my head a few times near the ending, which doesn't work for me, but still interesting. Well, it had to end some way. It's not a masterwork. I normally don't bother with recent movies, and 2015 is recent in my book. I usually watch movies decades old. Horror classics are also decades old, or at least those I would recommend.

A common criticism of many horror movies is that they use cheap pop-up scares to scare the viewers, something Eggers avoids in this movie.

imdb_the_witch_tedstixonakamaximummadness_20161028,The Witch,IMDb,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,2016-10-28,10,"""The Witch""- A haunting and complex fable.","One of the most complex and haunting films to emerge within the past decade, writer/director Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" is a troubling fable of religion and fanaticism expertly combined with the trappings of a classic horror story of witchcraft and savagery. Though perhaps misrepresented by a marketing campaign billing it is a straight- forward creepshow for the masses, the truth is that this is a hard-hitting and expertly crafted art-film, and is a rewarding and startling experience that will leave the open minded breathless. It is without doubt not a film for everyone, and its appeal will be limited... but this cannot detract from the fact that it is a masterpiece from a brilliant new voice in film. New England. The 17th Century. A family is excommunicated from their Puritanical plantation home due to their extreme and fanatical religious views that conflict with the establishment of their peers. Father William (Ralph Ineson) helps his flock to build and craft a new home on the edge of a vast forest, where he hopes to create a new life for his family- wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), twins Mercy and Jones (Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson) and infant son Samuel. However, not all is well. The disappearance of Samuel while playing with Thomasin causes an emotional rift within the family, tensions begin to run high due to the circumstances of their situation, mistrusts and deceits are slowly born and will push their limits of their devotion to one another and to god... and it soon becomes apparent that an otherworldly force may be at play... that a witch of the woods may be silently stalking the family. The film is Kubrickian in nature, relying on the slow and methodical establishment of character and atmosphere combined with complex metaphors and symbols to create a masterwork of terror and drama. It is a finely tuned experience, relying on the subtle and the suggestive as opposed to the overt and blatant. Rewarding the analytical and open among audiences, Eggers excels in his craft, building the narrative slowly and with great deliberation while constantly developing and evolving his characters. And while it may seem counter-intuitive, the film is oddly enough at its strongest not when delivering the plethora of chilling sequences and scares that are abundant. But rather, the film is at its strongest when it places its focus on the collapsing nature of the family unit, torn apart by their own doubt and devotion to their obsessive beliefs... even at the expense of logic, reason and safety. Though don't be fooled... this is still very much a frightening film, with many terrifying moments thanks to the disturbing portrayal of witchcraft and savagery. It just also happens to be a very thoughtful, contemplative and complicated film that does great work with its themes, and can be interpreted in a number of ways. The performances are just marvelous and are the other main contributing factor to the film's great success when combined with Eggers' masterful writing and direction. Anya Taylor-Joy stands tall in a breakout performance in the role of Thomasin, who becomes our main focus early on. Taylor-Joy is a revelation and despite her relatively young age, injects complexity, doubt and pathos into the role in a way that is beyond her years. Incredible work. Ralph Ineson is the other stand- out here, as the increasingly troubled William. Ineson plays the character as hopeful but increasingly haunted by his own faith, and it's a stirring and emotional performance. Dickie makes for another great character as Katherine, and she is the perfect compliment to Thomasin and William within the story. I also will give high markings to child-actor Harvey Scrimshaw as the young Caleb. Child actors are a tough sell much of the time, but Scrimshaw (similar to Taylor-Joy) seems to possess a talent that far exceeds expectation and does the role justice. To be honest, I cannot say a single thing to the detriment of the film. But I do feel the need to stress something I touched upon in the beginning. This is not a standard horror flick, and many have felt let-down and deceived by the admittedly poor marketing created for the film's release. The film was touted as ""scary"" and ""creepy"" and ""something we should not be seeing"" in a trailer filled with loud music stingers and many of the film's scares, suggesting a more straight-forward experience. This is not a horror film for the masses. This is not the sort-of movie a group of 17-year-olds will go to on a Friday night and feel fulfilled by. This is very much an art- picture. A movie that encourages thought and personal interpretation. And I think that far too many have dismissed it unfairly for failing to adhere to its poor marketing, as opposed to embracing it for what it actually is. To an extent, I understand feeling duped. And I'm not even a pretentious art-type. I love the ""Saw"" movies more than most. I get kicks out of brainless schlock like Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" and screwball comedies like ""Brain Donors."" And I think ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" isn't nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But you know what? I also appreciate true art. I adore it and embrace it and celebrate it. And ""The Witch"" is art at its purest. And I firmly believe it is unfair to condemn the film because the trailer wasn't the best representation of it. I give ""The Witch"" a perfect 10. It is not only amongst the best horror films of the decade. It is simply amongst the best films of the decade, regardless of genre.",951,26,34,False

A crafted and deliberate film which reflects on themes and tonal attributes clearly important to its filmmaker: writer-director Eggers; this directness of vision benefits 'The Witch' greatly. Technical credits and production standards are of a commendably high and effective standard. The period portrayal, whilst necessarily dramatically formulated, is immensely interesting: the language and accents, including the ""vocabulary of ideas"" of the protagonists is a particular high point in this historical horror. On the flip side most of the best moments of the film are clustered towards the first half with a diminution of highlights as the film progresses. The climax is perhaps rather modern in its sensibilities which I found to be really jarring after a film that is constrained to its depicted environment so rigorously by the writing and directing almost all through the prior runtime. Some of the character scenes between family members could have been more energetically staged and frame compositions are sometimes unable to make use of all the potential of the environment. For a considerable contribution to the historical horror/folk horror genres, and from a first time director, 'The Witch' is a strong announcement of a filmmaker with vision and purpose; in itself there is much to commend. I rate 'The Witch' a 7/10 and I would particularly recommend to fans of psychological horror/thrillers, historical films, folk horror and witchcraft/black magic horror.....it is far from perfect but with allowances made for a first time director this is a really good if not quite a very best or great standard film.",274,2,1,False

There's no apt way to describe the feeling this film is going to give you. It's a festering feeling that sits in the pit of your stomach that only gets more agitated as the images of the film sit in the sub-conscious. The Witch is truly unique in that regard; it's a new breed of horror never before seen by the genre. If you're expecting jump-scared and quick-cuts, prepare to be disappointed. This is a film which takes its time and demonstrates mastery of several technical elements of filmmaking. The cinematography is beautifully framed, well-lit and really adds to the uneasiness 'The Witch' aims to evoke. The performances across the board are brilliant, even among the child actors (though, be warned, the entire film is in Old English so pay attention to the dialogue). The direction and production design is especially impressive considering this a first-time director and long-time production designer. Eggers really hit the nail on the head with this horror masterpiece, which will certainly root itself in Horror film history. Do yourself a favor and watch this film whenever you can.

Prioritizing a clear establishment of family dynamics and religious ideas over plot machinations, Eggers creates a movie that is challenging both to watch and stop thinking about. Taylor-Joy is as excellent in the lead as I would hope, and the cinematography and music really put the audience in a creepy, anything can happen mental space fitting for the witch-fearing setting. The primary focus is on Thomasin's development, as she is used or mistrusted by all of her family. The fear of witches does make it clear how people are eager to find a scapegoat and how the family falls apart so quickly as bad things start to happen. The ending where the goat talks and she goes to join the witches was extremely well done - she had played her part as a proper daughter and everything went wrong, so when she is finally free of obligations with her parents dead, she decides to see what lies on the other side. It's a dark movie and leaves plenty of questions unanswered and open to interpretation - what exactly happened to Caleb? Did the mom or the twins do anything wrong? Are the Satan people/creatures real, imagined, or inhabited by his spirit? As a story of Thomasin's development and family struggles in the time period, it's a good one, but so much of the evil is uncertain. That may be an intentional choice - nobody knew anything or had more than suspicions and fears in the 17th century, so this is a folktale playing off those ideas. It succeeds in its main focuses and brings that dark, heavy atmosphere in spades.",305,3,3,False

imdb_the_witch_cody_phillipsphotography_20160228,The Witch,IMDb,cody-phillipsphotography,2016-02-28,10,A completely new experience in the horror genre,"Horror has been having it's highs and lows as of recent. There have been some fantastic film, like It Follows and some duds, such as last year's Dark Summer. Luckily, out of the dark waters of big budget horror comes spectacular indie horror films that defy the genre. The Witch defies what horror has been and what it will be. The Witch is one of the only films to rattle me to the core. I found myself alone in the theater, luckily being the only one to watch this film. I had nobody else there to watch with, feeling just as isolated as the characters in the film. I had to tell myself that this was just a movie several times throughout, as I became so invested in the film that I forgot it wasn't real. Being alone, I was fully able to immerse myself into The Witch, a feeling that I never will forget. This film is beautiful. Not only is the script perfect, the score is absolutely beautiful. It is absolutely haunting, creating the perfect atmosphere for the film. The score was perfect, coming in at the right times, causing so much more tension when there could have been some just from the film alone. This film, as many others films could have been, relies heavily on its soundtrack, as it puts forth even more dread than presented in the film. Without the soundtrack, this film would have felt extremely empty. But, the score needs a great movie to work efficiently. And Robert Eggers directing the film makes the film worthy of such a fantastic score. His camera work seems like he has had years of experience, while this is his debut feature. He had control over all aspects, as well as a clear goal that he wanted to achieve. His choice of color palate also was fantastic, as the cool blue tones had the feeling of dread, which is constantly present throughout the film. There were some scenes that were extremely dark and hard to watch, but this makes the film even more mysterious and it makes you even more uncomfortable than you were before. If this film were directed by another person (many other horror films are like this), the film could have been an absolute trainwreck. But in Eggers' hands, The Witch is able to prosper and become the film that achieves its full potential. The acting was superb as well. These performances felt extremely pure, since it seemed as if I were watching something filmed during the time the movie was set in. The standout, of course, was Anya Taylor-Joy. Her performance was the most genuine, where Ralph Ineson gives the most powerful performance. Both actors together had fantastic chemistry, creating the tension and bond needed for the film to succeed. Katie Dickie also was fantastic, being able to completely become a grieving mother. This cast was honestly just stunning. I can say that The Witch is not for everybody. I've read countless reviews claiming that this is the worst movie that they have seen. I feel that this film should not have had a wide release, as the general public won't, and hasn't, enjoyed the movie at all. If this film was released in independent theaters, I think that there would be a whole other reception from the public, as not everyone would be going and seeing it. Nonetheless, The Witch is absolutely an amazing film. While 2016 doesn't seem like it will be the year where many quality horror films are released, The Witch absolutely makes up for the movies that won't be coming out. While this film may not be for everyone, it should be taken with a grain of rice and should be at least considered, as it is a fantastic film. I can say that this may be one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the greatest horror movies to be released.",659,8,7,False

Once there, supernatural forces intensify their paranoia of witchcraft. The story is sparse but compact. While its ending is too mysterious and leaves many holes, it is still fascinating in its own special way. The greatest flaw in the film is that much of the dialogue is incomprehensible. It has the right intention in using old English and an older dialect. However, as some important lines are muddled, much gets lost. Despite this flaw, the acting is quite good as are the production values. There is a suitably bleak mood that rightly surrounds a family falling apart in facing great difficulty. Their dour, paranoid views of God, Satan, and witchcraft don't help matters. One wonders if their belief systems are at least as horrific as the outside forces. Overall, the pluses outweigh the minuses.",162,3,3,False
imdb_the_witch_wuchakk_20161112,The Witch,IMDb,Wuchakk,2016-11-12,5,Unsettling slow burn to hopeless perdition,"Released in 2015 and written/directed by Robert Eggers, ""The Witch"" (aka ""The VVitch: A New-England Folktale"") involves a devout family in the 17th century who leave a Puritan plantation due to theological differences and build a farm house in the New England wilderness. A string of tragedies offers evidence of a diabolical witch dwelling in the mysterious woods as the family descends into madness. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie play the parents, William and Katherine, while Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw play the oldest of the five kids, Thomasin and Caleb. The film is based on Eggers' childhood fascination with witches. Much research was done, extensively working from records in English and American museums, as well as consulting 17th century agricultural experts. The labors of Eggers & his team can be observed in the film because it's thoroughly convincing, as far as sets, dialogue and acting go. Speaking of dialogue, I encourage you to utilize the subtitles because you'll only understand half of the Old English verbiage. ""The Witch"" is a mix of family drama, folktale and horror, coming across as a combo of four films: ""The Crucible"" (1996), ""The Village"" (2004), ""Blood on Satan's Claw"" (1971) and the satanic ritual sequence of ""The Devil Rides Out"" (ake ""The Devil's Bride) (1968). It's more supernatural and creepy than the first two, but if you like these four films you'll probably appreciate it. ""The Witch"" brilliantly captures the paranoia & superstition of Puritan communities in New England around the time of the Salem witch trials of 1692-1693 and melds it with supernatural horror. Everything is interwoven into a macabre ode of a time & place where people imagined witches and devils dwelling in the dark woods except here they're for real. The family is a good loving family, but they're bound by the legalism of the strain of Calvinism they embrace. The father's proud, non-sectarian spirit cuts them off from the support of the only accessible community. By themselves in the black forest, they're open prey to the devil & his denizens. While the movie's admirable in so many ways, including the fact that it's ambiguous enough to be open to interpretation, it's also generally dull and too unpleasant for my tastes (yes, I realize it's SUPPOSED to be 'unpleasant' to a degree since it's a horror flick, but the third act just gets too ugly and leaves a bad taste). But Anya Taylor-Joy is magnificent and Ralph Ineson is excellent. The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Kiosk, Ontario, Canada. Costing only $3.5 million, it made $40.5 million worldwide with $25 million from North America. GRADE: C+ ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (***SPOILER ALERT***) Some commentators absurdly suggest that Thomasin is better off at the end than living within the religious confines of her family or the Puritan community. Really? She now gets to slaughter babies in the woods and eventually face eternal damnation; yeah, that's just so incredibly liberating. Would she really be happy joining a bunch of murderous beasts, a couple of which just slaughtered her family? Interestingly, grinding babies to death is presumably female emancipation in this ""folktale"" and that's not too far from reality in modern Western culture. Other commentators suggest that we don't know if what's going on is real or the result of mental illness due to extreme religiosity or a perhaps even a nightmare. ANSWER: Yes, we do know. From almost the very beginning we KNOW there's an actual diabolical witch in the area, which we SEE stole the baby and bathes in his blood. Shortly later we observe that this satanic ritual brings back her youth (or, at least, the appearance of youth); and she seduces Caleb, showing that she's a friggin' pedophile. The only thing we don't know is if there is more than one witch or what the devil's place in the events is or isn't, both of which are revealed literally in the final act. Furthermore, if the witch is a delusion of one or more of the family members then that means that Thomasin or one of the others took the baby; of perhaps an animal. So where's the body or remains and why weren't William & Caleb able to find it during their thorough searches? If one of them or an animal, like a wolf, took and killed the infant where's the evidence, where's the blood? We see zero evidence to draw this conclusion. Also keep in mind that the movie is subtitled a 'folktale' and is based on actual documents from the 17th century. In other words, the movie doesn't depict reality, but is exactly what it says it is -- a folk TALE where ugly, evil witches who bathe in infants' blood and devils who masquerade as goats really lurk in the dark woods and are to be feared. So the surmounting tragedies the family experiences aren't a product of hyper-religious paranoia or a nightmare, but rather the result of confrontation with sinister beings, both physical and spiritual, which exist in the 'world' of the movie. Lastly, the message of the film is obvious: Don't leave the strength and protection of the community of believers due to arrogance or you'll be picked off one by one by the Enemy; or, at least, seduced into joining the dark side.",882,28,26,False

Instead of uniting them, religion, more often than not, did exactly the opposite - that is the product of humanity's lack of truly understanding what religion is about and how to live in agreeance with its nature and God. Seven members of the family each represent one of the seven deadly sins, and it's fitting that they all end up accordingly to them. This film shows that believing in God and praying each night is not what religion is about - it's about being honest with yourself and others around you, and working your way to build strong relationships, both with yourself and others, which each character in this film failed to do - instead, they kept it inside and ended up severing the bonds between each other, all in their own unique way.

imdb_the_witch_jtindahouse_20160429,The Witch,IMDb,jtindahouse,2016-04-29,6,Had hoped for more,"Since the beginning of filmmaking Hollywood has struggled to deal with the subject of witches. In recent decades they have mostly just been used as a source for light humour and even children's films. Films like 'Practical Magic' and of course the 'Harry Potter' series have taken a mostly harmless attitude towards the subject, and the audiences have seemed satisfied. I am currently watching season three of 'American Horror Story' titled 'Coven'. Going into it I had pictured (and hoped for) quite a dark overall theme. Unfortunately what I have found is again a lighter approach, and I would have to say I'm not overly enjoying it. So when I heard there was a film coming out titled 'The Witch', which seemed from the trailers to have a very dark approach taken, I was excited. Did it live up to my expectations? Sort of. I left 'The Witch' with a sort of ""Meh"" feeling, despite having enjoyed it for the most part. Frankly, I had hoped for more. I was aware this wasn't going to be your standard type of horror film with jump scares left, right and centre. An atmospheric horror is fine by me and something I often enjoy more than the alternative. But for me the atmosphere wasn't really having an affect either. It didn't help the dialogue was nothing short of exhausting to listen to and take meaning from. For me that element unfortunately took away from what the film was trying to achieve. It had to be there, it's simply unfortunate. There was a little bit of a mystery element surrounding things, which was probably the aspect I enjoyed most about the film. That may have lead a little to the ""Meh"" feeling I got too though, as I felt the mystery never really came to much. The acting was superb, it would have to be said, and that side of things did a terrific job in covering up what could otherwise be considered a very slow-burning story at times. After the film I was left to ask myself a question. Are witches a potentially scary film subject? I'm yet to be convinced they are.",360,7,13,False

It's certainly a great-looking movie with an authentic period feel. The performances are all excellent. Two of the biggest complaints I've read are that (a) it's boring and (b) the witch is real and not just a metaphor or something like some would prefer. To the first complaint I would say that those people should stick with their found footage garbage. To the second complaint, which is coming primarily from certain types of critics, I say I'm glad the witch is real. I understand the power of suggestion and I value psychological horror as much as the next person, but it seems like the majority of movies made about witches, particularly about them during this period, have been unsubtle studies of persecution and superstition. That's all well and good, and interesting in its own way, but this is scary because the threat is real and you know it's real the whole film. Yes the family is at each other's throats and the bulk of the tension and drama comes from that, but the witch and who she serves are also a big part of the film and provide some of the most terrifying scenes.

The movie knew what it was and if you like jump-scares and gore. Avoid this or make up your mindset to watch this. After all that, you might be wondering why the 7 star rating, because I didn't enjoy it entirely. I am not saying it is not good but probably, I wanted more. Let's discuss pros and cons, keep in mind, it is from my personal view-point. PROS- Acting wise, Anya was on point. She was very believable as the helpless girl in a strange time. Ralph Ineson, I loved his voice. I loved how he played a father with flaws. Dickie as the weeping mother with high superstitions and always irritated with Thomasin was nice. The cinematography was awesome. It completely captured the darkness of a time fueled by superstitions. I will give kudos to the director for choosing to make a horror film which is extremely difficult considering how horror movies are made nowadays. CONS- The child actors playing Caleb and the twins didn't have the acting to pull off their characters. Probably they should have been given lesser screen time. I wanted more of the witch or at-least a back story as to how the lore of the witch had started. Not an origin story but a 15-minute intro couldn't have hurt. The goat totally put me off. I tried to be serious when I saw the goat but I accept it. Goats are my weakness. All in all. It is a fresh inclusion to the horror genre and other horror movie directors can take notes from it.

Albeit, this was a very unusual film, and one that I grappled with for a little while to reach a conclusive idea of my final thoughts towards it. As the directorial debut of Robert Eggers, The VVitch (as it is stylised in the promotional material) is a film that germinates in your mind and leaves a stronger lasting impression days after watching more than it leaves an immediate one. There is a great deal of subtlety that is utilised in this movie, and it is from the age-old concept of the 'fear of the unknown' that the film finds its niche. However, where the film has and will likely continue to divide some audiences is in its presentation. This was a remarkably bleak looking film, full of greys and darker tones; with not a skerric of any real colour to be found. By design, it is a washed-out looking movie. Set in the 17th century with a recently banished lone Puritan family at its centre, the movie is meant to present the hardships and blandness of that era and it does so by its choice of colour palette. The use of Early Modern English in the dialogue is another talking point. The use of this style of language will be jarring to some but it works effectively enough in the context of the film's setting, and apparently, at times was plucked word-for-word from local journals recovered from that period. While each member of the cast does a great job making it feel genuine, there are moments where it feels as if the archaic dialogue gets in the way of plot and character progression. This movie is the definition of a slow burn, having more in common with The Babadook than The Conjuring. Anya Taylor-Joy turns out a wonderful performance and is convincing in her role as the family's eldest child, who questions her existence as the family question their faith. This is a difficult film to recommend and is an atypical horror film, designed to creep under your skin than to shock outright. It is one more in line with those from the turn of the century.",376,2,2,False

It takes an understanding of the time period and classic witchcraft to follow this epic film. That being said, this movie was spectacular, it has a feel of what could or would have happened. It's not some cheesy jump scare or gory Hollywood slasher, it is a true art form horror. This movie had me on the edge from the beginning. I've watched a lot of artistic horror films and this one is a real masterpiece. I am honored to know that films like this are still being made. I would have added more nudity and gore, but it holds its own and doesn't really need my suggestion. When I thought it was over, they stacked more, and that little bit was even better.

The Witch, in my opinion, is an achievement that has set the pace on several fronts: 1. Horror that creates a sense of slow-burn unease, spiked by occasional moments of shock. This is a shift from the previously-omnipresent jump scare nature of this genre. 2. Horror that is historically-based, well researched, and thus is even ""educational"" viewing. 3. Horror that is actor-centric, while still clearly being atmospheric. 4. Perhaps the greatest achievement of his master-work, The Witch, was the ability to create and develop characters from centuries ago with dilemmas which resonate today. Kudos to Robert Eggers on his freshman effort, capturing the attention of many actors who now strive to work with this humble auteur of the art of film-making.

Without regular contact with others, some families only interacted with each other. This film sets up the extreme version of that, with the family deep in the woods. It is bleak and disturbing, even before anything supernatural happens. The acting is good, but it lacked the depth of character development that I needed to really care about the characters. Rather than feeling emotionally invested, I just felt like, ""Hmm, that's interesting."" And it often was. Though at times it was also quite slow.

imdb_the_witch_saeedahmedsasoli_20201124,The Witch,IMDb,saeedahmedsasoli,2020-11-24,10,Brilliantly shot.,"This was the result of a director who not only painstakingly researched every aspect of colonial life in the 1630s, but who also executed his ideas with striking confidence. The aspects of the film (lighting, sound, dialog, pacing, composition) created an atmosphere so real I was no longer sitting on my couch watching, but rather living this inherited puritan nightmare. The movie's controlling idea is simple: The prevailing human desire to seek reassurance from a higher power can easily be twisted by ignorance, superstition, psychological insecurities and a horrendous misinterpretation of religion into a culture of self-flogging that nurtures guilt and fear until they become invincible beasts, then lets them lose on the mind to devour it whole. The result of this scary process is a flock of pariahs, known by the fancy, superstitious name of ""witches"" who live on the peripheries of society, devoid of any means of compassion, stripped of all sanity and civility, living in a world of morbid fantasies and diseased hallucinations in which they are left defenseless to their auto-cannibalistic minds that devour their sanity. The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years. The Witch to me, is a brilliantly shot (natural lighting and using a different aspect ratio to get the sense of isolation), well acted and fascinatingly told. It is a simple story that leaves a big impact, if you are looking for an eerie, haunting film that will make you think.",318,4,2,False
imdb_the_witch_breakdownthatfilm_blogspot_com_20190830,The Witch,IMDb,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,2019-08-30,7,A disturbing and unsettling period horror film,"Any genre has all kinds of avenues to explore when it comes to storytelling. The setting alone can be a factor as to how a story will play out. Specifically period pieces. These types of tales can be a bit tricky to handle based on the accuracy the picture and the direction the narrative heads in. If there was a time though to focus on that was one of the scariest, it would be when witches were a big deal. Witch trials were a serious thing during their medieval times and onward. As soon as a witch was even spoken of, things would go south pretty quickly. People would begin having fanatic fits of hysteria and meltdowns, all to be sure such creature was never present. This is more or less what happens here in this uniquely horrifying film. The story to this film is about a family in the 1600s who is banished from their plantation after a religious dispute. After moving out and settling elsewhere, the family's newborn son is snatched away as to what was surmised as a witch. Fearing the worst, the family begins to suspect everything around them, including themselves. Writing and directing this was Robert Eggers, in his first feature film debut. Accomplishing this is not an easy task to begin with, which already is an impressive start. The script is simplistic yet effective in its story to show just how little is needed to make it good. One of the contributing factors to this experience is the atmosphere that is felt. Much of it is unsettling and ominous looking because of how secluded the location is. The cast are believable in their roles. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the first born daughter who witnesses her youngest sibling's vanishing gives a memorable performance. That and her chemistry with her father William (Ralph Ineson) and mother Katherine (Kate Dickie) are quite the struggle. Thomasin's other siblings Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) are also perform well. Caleb comes in second to that of Thomasin for length of screen time. Both Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie were in the HBO series Game of Thrones. While Anya Taylor-Joy was in Split (2016) and Glass (2019). Bathsheba Garnett and Sarah Stephens who play the witches are quite unnerving to say the least and are very convincing. The minor issues in the story are the parts that are not explained. Some characters' fates go unresolved. Nothing is shown what might have happened to them. This is critical when it comes to showing closure in a story. The other flaw was the cause of the whole plot. As the narrative is executed, the thought of someone being a witch begins to surface. Yet it is never explained as to who was the witch, if at all. Understandably so there will be confusion, but also clarity should be brought to light on the inquiry. As for horror, there's only one jump scare and it doesn't even involve a sting which is great. The rest is unrelenting dread that is displayed. There is blood and gore but not much. It's more of the sense of being left alone that is more horrifying. Cinematography was well shot too. Handled by Jarin Blaschke, the camera remains steady and focused. Many times, the lens is aimed strategically at one place in order to cause unrest with the viewer. Blaschke also filmed for Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet (2009) and Fray (2012). Lastly there's the film score composed Mark Korven. The music heard is a mix of ethereal female chants, minimal strings and very light percussion. All of which present this story in such a disturbing way, it will make the audience feel like there really is something among them that is not right. Korven also scored films like White Room (1990), Cube (1997) and Cruel & Unusual (2014). Either way, it is simple for all the right reasons. Minor points like character resolutions and definite cause of plot is the only issue here. The actors give solid performances, the visuals are quite discomforting (in a good way) and the music is creepily memorable.",692,2,2,False

Yet, it is not what it is nowadays considered ""mainstream"" : the traditional setting of countless childhood fairy tales here constitutes the basis of a perfect horror construction. The contrast between innocence and vice, which also emerged from my previous considerations, is also the central point of this movie, joined by the, also mentioned, illusory nature of the most simple things. Words, looks, basic gestures, animals, even young children are, to quote a famous Log Lady, ""not what they seem"". Furthermore, the Woods used for the setting are simply majestic.

imdb_the_witch_icedooitle_20160524,The Witch,IMDb,Icedooitle,2016-05-24,8,To Fear a Witch,"The full title is, The Witch: A New England Folktale. Like Grimm's fairy tales, American folklore has taken revisions over the centuries to become a palatable collection of juvenile life lessons. Anyone who has read the original versions of these stories knows how brutal, horrifying, and far removed they are from our current values. As much as I would not condone reading original classic witch tales to a small child, they do contain much deeper implications and ideas than the simple ""Don't tell lies"" that are gleaned from modern revisions. What's fascinating about The Witch is how familiar the setting and story is, without a single cliché or moment of prediction to speak of. The evil that was feared in 17th Century Puritan America has been so eclipsed by the human horrors of The Salem Witch Trials, that we have forgotten what it was to fear a witch. We know these characters only by their Christian names. William removes his family from their Colonial settlement due to an incompatibility of faith. The colony of Puritans isn't Christian enough. With his wife, Katherine, William takes his 4 children into the wilds of the Northeast. Airs of The Crucible envelope the setting. Common pronouns are replaced with ""thines"" and ""thous"". Dialogue is delivered as if quoted from Shakespeare or the Bible itself. In the past, this oral dynamic has always sounded ardently rehearsed. Somehow, it's natural here. Considering William's rigorous faith, you might expect him to be an overbearingly shrewd father. He is in fact a loving and good man of his time; often a pushover. Katherine is the more fearsome parent, with a shrill voice and gaunt pointed face. While they do live in hardship, this is a good family. Once Fall deadens the colors and greys the skies, things begin to take a disturbing turn. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie play the parents without an exaggeration of the material. Remarkable still are the actors portraying their children. Harvey Scrimshaw plays William's 10-year- old son, Caleb, as natural as can be imagined. The dramatic beats of a horror movie come with taxing climactic moments and Scrimshaw acts beyond his years. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the eldest daughter Thomasin; a doe-eyed blonde beauty who plays the most relatable character of the flock. The dynamic between Caleb and Thompsin has notes of innocent sexual tension. Their secluded life leaves a great deal of new feelings that can't be addressed due to their customs. These feelings lead to foreign temptations that are preyed upon by the timeless evil beyond the trees. The greatest achievement of this film is how faithful it is to its setting and story, while keeping enough behind the veil to become engrossing. The tale feels as old as any, drawing from universal fears and motivations. How it draws you in, keeping you tied to the victims and their perspective while keeping the evil at arm's length, shows a discipline of craft that greatly compliments the material. Much like vampires, witches have been trivialized and diluted by film into something superficially attractive and entertainingly evil. As with Noseferatu, seeing a witch living a damnable existence of ugliness is much more appropriate. If they're ever beautiful, they won't be for long.",538,4,2,False

Strong, intelligent, and they don't usually try to cause harm to others. This movie? It reminds/teaches us that witches can be freaking scary. This movie seriously feels like we're being told a story around a campfire in the best possible way. This must be what people during the Salem Witch Trials believed happened on a regular basis. It feels like a legend (or a legal account depending on where you are in history) being told to warn sinners about what could happen if you let the devil into your life. The movie even outright says it in its alternate title, The VVitch: A New England Folk-Tale. If you go into the movie with that kind of mindset, more of the elements will start to make sense. This movie would have been rated higher if I could just understand the entire script!

The early seventeenth century marks the earliest of American history, not too long after the pilgrims made a home for themselves in the New World. With a land that was mostly unknown and passage back to Europe taking weeks, that's a great example of a location where you have no choice but to face it head on. Even without the possibilities of something supernatural, there's still animals and Native American attacks that could prove forceful and frightening. At the time, the pilgrims left England as they felt the religious standards were too lose and wanted to practice without ridicule. The last thing you want is to be stuck with pilgrims as their moral beliefs steam from the ideal that if someone is acting out of the ordinary, then they must have made a pact with Satan. This would even lead into the famous Salem Witch trials that persecuted several people that were have thought to have practiced witchcraft. While this film is set decades before those trials took place, The Witch paints a scary picture that would make any fundamentalist into a pilgrim. Within the early days of the New World, William (played by Ralph Ineson) is even more religious then his fellow pilgrims, deciding that he and his family need to leave the plantation and search for their own home. He settles on this parch of land where he builds a farm and try to make a life for his wife Katherine (played by Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), eldest son Caleb, twins Mercy and Jonas, and baby Samuel. Things get creepy right away when Samuel is taken while playing a game of peek-a-boo with Thomasin. Katharine spends her days crying to god while Caleb and William do their best to hunt to feed their family. Thomasin overhears that her parents want to send her to another family now that she's approaching womanhood. This put more tension within the family as crops are failing and are not even sure they will have enough food during the upcoming winter. Caleb then goes missing during a hunting outing with Thomasin's twin sibling accusing her of being a witch. When Caleb is found close to death, more eyes from the family blame Thomasin for the bad things happening, despite her innocence. The Witch is film that scared me more then half of the horror movies I've seen in the past three years. A lot of it has to do with the setting as the entire story feels unsettling. The dark imagery of the forest, the farm and even a simple dinner feel threatening as if there is no escape from any danger. Anya Taylor-Joy is a total breakout as she represents the last of innocence that any girl would have, regardless of that time period or now, within this circumstance. She carries the movie well enough that we wanted to see whether she'd escape. The story manages to remain more layered then it needs to be. With little explanation on what the monster is here. The filmmaker understands that the scariest ideas may not be the unseen force, but rather the people that start to look at you at the first sign on trouble. I would love to watch this again, though subtitles would be a welcome addition. Everyone talks in an older, Middle-English tone that makes the setting more alien, though a little hard to understand. Slasher fans may find this too slow, but it freaked me out. I'll give this ten black goats out of ten.

imdb_the_witch_felipecarrillo_20160415,The Witch,IMDb,FelipeCarrillo,2016-04-15,10,"""The VVitch"": A Jewel of Pure Horror Since ""The Conjuring"" Film.","Robert Eggers joins the list of the best directors in the genre of the horror of the decade with his first invention of the genre, along with my great idol, James Wan. There are great attributes in the film, the most important ""printing"". It is logical to think that the movie will comply with poor requirements of today's horror films, but no, this goes beyond, it has tone, it has history, it has soul and has strength. The debut of the director and writer Robert Eggers revolutionizes the genre for the 21st century; trampling all the clichés of the genre and proposing a new face for horror films, it is intelligent, absorbing, stressful and really leaves the audience with a trauma after leaving the theater. The project of Eggers has own terror and does not need jump-scares or any other discounted help to create an atmosphere that even without that it passes nothing wrong feels tension and danger. Perhaps, it is true that ""The VVitch"" won't have the same thematic impact that had ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1991 but if it will have a drastic impact on films of last 5 decades. To create a masterpiece like this, it is not necessary to record scenes difficult to understand (""Inception"" - ""Donnie Darko"") but record scenes difficult to see, film does not take decisions easy but is one of the few excellent horror films where the psychological is not the first trick. The only purpose of the director was capturing the true tale of the New England where religion took side against evil. An extremely religious family composed by mother (Katherine - Kate Dickie) - a Christian woman committed 100 percent to pray and be in communion in all respects religious-, father (William - Ralph Ineson) - a woodcutter who must confront himself for standing to his family and deal with everything that is over him-, the eldest daughter, and face female protagonist of the movie (Thomasin - Anya Taylor-Joy) - a teenager girl from a religious family that's happening by physical and hormonal changes typical for a young man who is prone to overlook the situation that will give a twist to the plot of her life-, the duo of younger siblings, (and so frightening) Mercy and Jonas - Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson)-two ordinary children who serve as gate to destroy the little stability that the family had had after they banished them (this sounds very similar to ""Adam and Eve"") is confronted to begin again once they were evacuated from the villa where they remained (have to take into account that it is the MDCXXX century (16th century), where there are no hotel, houses or shelters) for purely religious reasons. The father being the head of the family, decides to entrust himself to the Lord and bring them to a forgotten forest to begin a new life together filled with love and peace. After settling there, children play, the father imitates a grower, mother do household chores with her daughter, all normal, until evil touches to their door. Strange but meticulously timed events begin to happen and tension and flame of the film is born and progresses in an uncontrollable manner. A big plus for the movie was the period where was record it, where everything seemed a film of horror, even Eggers' team make it seem better than it was at that time. It is imposing the eye and hand of the director for a show scene with such high quality, dark, evil, totally expressionless. Touching parameters of all horror films but revolutionizing them, as the rain where terror was more dramatic than physical, the forest, where someone was not intended them, someone wanted them, the witch, the presentations were great, Eggers is my third master. The cast is perfect. The formula is again present. No Hollywood stars is needed to give tone and fame to this project. The little unknown cast made us familiarize ourselves better with the characters and in part served to launch the notoriety to Anya Taylor-Joy (born in Miami, but proudly bred by Latinos) and two children. The first appearance of the witch is totally frightening and surprising, it makes to scream to the public with natural elements, with images and a monumental instrumentation that decorate the scene as a typical and disturbing tale of fear. The second appearance of the witch is too much ""Red Riding Hood"" but the more praised. I have no words to express the mysticism, finesse but at once grotesque introduction, ambiance, scenery, everything, everything... While some people, the end not has seemed them very good, for my was the best, and that it was the result of an excellent game, that had that be the end and the way how they projected it was ambitious, real and mysterious.

The story takes place in the 17th century New England and follows the life of a religious family venturing out of their colony in search of prosperity. The movie does not use jump scares or other cheap forms of horror to achieve its blood curdling results. Instead it brings to life a complex historical mythology. The constant development of this mythology in the story works well in capturing the viewers interest time and again. With all of this said, the story does fall short in certain areas. The film's ambition is exciting to see, however, it comes up short due to poor acting in some parts and seemingly forced plot points. Had the film flowed more naturally from piece to piece it would have had an overall greater impact in its execution. The film tries to balance pacing with high quality cinematography and the results are accordingly underwhelming.

imdb_the_witch_nitzanhavoc_20180624,The Witch,IMDb,nitzanhavoc,2018-06-24,9,The real challange was finding a reason not to rate 10. Stop reading and go watch.,"Often when reviewing Horror films (my favorite genre) I discuss the acute necessity of lowered expectations if one hopes to enjoy, as sadly this undervalued genre lacks the investment (professional, financial and creative) it so rightfully deserves. More often than not a film of the genre graced with a great trailer, an intriguing poster or any form of positive publicity (mostly informal) is devoid of any remotely sufficient quality of story, acting or cinematics. However, in regards to The Witch - worry not. Bring on your highest expectations and be mentally prepared to trash this film as soon as it's finished, it would do you no good. In my opinion, The Witch is one of the best Horror films you'll watch. Everything about The Witch feels classical and fancy, as something about the combination between Little House in the Prairie and Poltergeist hits the atmospheric spot perfectly. The setting, while simple almost to the point of being unimpressive (but just almost), is original and very seldom implemented in such a terrifying plot. The story revolves around William and his Family, a stereotypically devout (even fanatic) Christian family from 19th century New England. After leaving their community on account of its inhabitants not being sufficiently Christian by William's judgement, the family establishes their own little homeland in a nearby rural plain. A wooden shack, a farm, a stock of barnyard animals and the satisfaction of a hard day's work and doing well by one's cherrished deity. That is, until a mysterious and nefarious force begins to torment the family, weakening their faith as well as their family ties and letting their paranoia drive them apart to the point of hatered. The acting is superb by all members of the cast, particularly the breathtaking Anya Taylor-Joy (daughter Thomasin). You know all these slasher films casting eye candies with mediocre and unconvincing acting? Forget them. Taylor-Joy is genuinely authentic and professional aside from being captivating like a renaissance model. Harvey Scrimshaw (her brother, Caleb) also with a superb performance, damaged somewhat solely by what is obviously a direction error. Ralph Ineson (William) is also a pleasure to watch and experience. Aside from the acting skills, the casting has been as accurate and clever as can be (probably along with some excellent writing, directing and art-dress-makeup). Each and every character feels real, authentic and compelling, making me personally feel like each and every cast member was made for their role. Enough to warrant a 6.5 even if this has been the film's sole quality. It isn't. Not remotely. The story is an emotional roller-coaster, sharply and almost violently dragging the viewer from sadness to anticipation, from suspense to fear, from pity to anger. Indeed, the dark force tormenting the family seems to affect the viewers similarly, drawing them into the story and making the entire experience all the more horrific. It isn't a literary masterpiece, but a good screenplay needs not be to achieve its goal. It only needs to tell a compelling and clever story with the right dosage of fear. Add to that the 19th century setting, the old English texts and the farmhand costumes - and you feel like you're told an old terrifying folktale. An absolute pleasure! The only aspect in which I felt the film didn't fulfill its potential was the ending. A worthy attempt to create a plot twist was indeed made, but unsuccessfully. The ending feels like the worst part of the film, the least exciting and not at all frightening. From certain perspectives one might even consider it a happy ending, which is completely out of touch with the mood the film worked so hard to create. In a word: anticlimactic, the all too familiar bane and curse of the genre. While The Witch is simply that good as to not suffer in quality on this fault's account - I can't help but feel disappointed, as it really was one good ending (not even great, just good and better than the actual one) from being a Horror masterpiece. In summary? I can't remain objective, I loved this film too much. I simply feel obligated to encourage each and every cinema fan to turn off the lights and watch The Witch, preferably at night and home alone. Of course, many of you might disagree with me, it's a matter of subjective preferences after all, but I personally am grateful for the experience The Witch has put me through.",741,10,10,False

It was just like ""Watch this family not like each other, oh and yeah there's a witch somewhere in the woods."" We were trying to watch a creepy horror movie.

For those that love slow, yet tense, horror films that are as bizarre as they are scary, this film is for you. The Witch is unnerving, super realistic, and wacky to a fault. I will say that the film's writer and director Robert Eggers did an amazing job for a directorial debut, and he is undoubtedly a force to watch in the future. From the opening scene of the film to the very end the film is unnerving. The film is quite slow, but never really boring, because the filmmakers did a great job creating a very tense tone. The tone is essentially formed from three major elements of the movie, the bone-chilling music, the ominous cinematography (especially in the forest), and the always noticeable presence of darkness lurking. In this film the titular character isn't in the film often, but their presence is felt. Combine that with the excruciating attention to detail, and the film takes on a sense of reality. The film is extremely realistic, and that is because Eggers took the time, and had the attention to detail to make the film as realistic as possible. While the dialogue may distract some, it is exactly how people used to talk in the colonial era. The lighting is usually dim, but is to is realistic as the film is literally made to look as if it's being lit by candlelight or moonlight. The actors were on point, most likely due to great direction, and the sets were almost exactly what one would expect things to look like back then. That kind of dedication, deserves respect, but it also helps the audience get lost in the filmic world. However, the film is downright wacky, and in some ways that's great, and in others it hurt the film a little. The film is unlike anything I've ever seen before, in an interview Eggers said his original pitch was ""too weird, or too obscure"" considering the film he made, I want to see that film because this one was wonderfully obscure and weird. However, the film was a little hard to follow, at times it felt as though too many things would happen in a short period filled with moments of confusion, which did help reinforce the insanity the characters were growing into, but made it harder to follow. It may not have helped the film, but as an observation, the film was devoid of humor. In the end, the film is original, unnerving, realistic, very well made, but does have an obscure feeling to it. The cinematography is beautiful, the filmmakers had an amazing attention to detail, and horror fans will most likely like the film.

Admittedly, this might not mesh well for those seeking a higher pace horror, and it's quite understandable with the peculiar premise, but it has an intense atmosphere and cripplingly disturbing moments. A family is banished to a faraway land with little prospect. In there, they find that danger lurks outside their farm and also within their family. Props for the actors, including the children, who manage to create a timely sense of the period. It's not the same medieval type movie, first and foremost it's unapologetically dark. The tension arrives as this family is constantly dealing with daily pressure with not all members having the same footing. It escalates into real threat as the occult talk is seeping into their minds. The eerie soundtracks add to this effect, it just brings a feeling of dread and uncomfortable air. However, this presentation can present a couple of problems, one being it might alienate audience. The accent and slow burn are not for everyone, also it doesn't have a hook like more mainstream The Conjuring with clear narrative as it plays with a lot of analogies and the philosophy of the time.

When I saw the first preview for VVitch in October, I pondered whether or not to see this movie, not because it didn't look interesting, but because I questioned the impact it would have on my spirit and moreover my soul. Rob Zombie's The Lords of Salem (2012) was one of the better takes on the witch in American Cinema. His representation was frightening and enchanting, drawing you into it's madness as the female protagonist, played by Sherri Moon Zombie, slips into the world of the witch. Cable TV Shows like American Horror Story and True Blood also crafted their versions of the folkloric succubus, while mainstream media and broadcast TV typically glamorize these demonic women to fit popular culture. The Witches of Eastend (Netflix, Jenna Dewan Tatum) put a Norse spin on the origins of witch clans, while the shows Salem and A Penny Dreadful brutally recant the trials which suspected and actual witches faced. Both shows are led by phenomenal actors; Janet Montgomery, who plays Mary Sibley in the Lovecraftian drama, Salem; and Eva Green, Casino Royale's to die for Bond-girl, who darkens every scene with her piercing blue eyes, passionate prose and gorgeous charisma. Last summer, I listened to an audio book entitled, The Teachings of Don Juan, by Carlos Castaneda. The book is an autobiographical account by Castaneda of his exploration into the world of hallucinogens, with a Native America (Don Juan) witch doctor serving as his apprehensive guide. After returning from one of his hallucinations, Castaneda is warned by Don Juan that a witch has found a way into his psyche and might manifest him/herself in the physical world unless Don Juan draws her out. The account of the exorcism is a frightening moment for the reader and author. It is the same underlying feeling of Castaneda's journey that courses through each word, each scene, and embodies this real world witch, a movie so carefully and perfectly crafted by Robert Eggers, it ensures cult status. The Witch is horrifying in its very presentation, with the threat of the unknown always looming. A shining light within the film, Anya Taylor-Joy, plays Thomasin, the beautiful eldest daughter of a farm fed family. Her coming of age, along with several subtle nuances create a duality within the film which is slowly delivered with small, yet impacting, climactic moments. One of the more apparent overtones in the movie is represented by a beautifully candlelit sequence where William (Father), played by Ralph Ineson recites a prayer while holding up a bit of bread that will soon be broken and eaten by his family. William's appearance resembles that of an imagined Christ, on one occasion his clothing appears as swaddling cloth as if an aberration of the Son of God was plucked from a Renaissance painting and superimposed into this film. William's twin children are an indulgence of the eyes and ears, to say the least, their perfect delivery of the well-crafted dialog all but solidifies the films believability. Their relationship to the families blasphemously black, horned billy goat is a trepidation, their counter charm an essential ingredient in the films making. It's always difficult to see children in a role which may expose them to moments of stolen innocence, yet the poetic dialog and tactful inclusion/exclusion of the children during brutal yet necessary moments in the movie allowed for a clear conscience. That's not to say you don't get your witch. The Witch is monstrous, horrifying, cunning, and seedy enough to gratify your well-deserved disgust.",599,7,6,False

My biggest complain comes from the slow build up, it is too slow before we see any actual horror. I am a big believer in psychological scares, no need for gore and actual violence to shock and terrify an audience, however this film did not deliver by slowly dragging itself in a boring slow paced drama masqueraded as a horror. The film functions more as a period piece, and at times i could not understand the dialogue. the ending was not clear and to be frank i noticed multiple opportunities that could have been used to frighten the viewers but were sorely dismissed. At times the film is misleading and the lack of clarity is what bothered me most. Its as if the entire film is building up to this dark reveal that ends up a mere shade of pale grey.

I wrote a review not really praising it but finding the film interesting. The film stuck with me, however. I then read ""The Witches: Salem, 1692"" by Stacy Schiff which is an historical account of the much later trials (that we are all vaguely aware of, but whose details I for one was unfamiliar with). It also contains some of the material and texture that the filmmaker was employing in writing his film. Reading the book actually made me want to watch the film again and evaluate it on it's own merits, not some half-baked expectations of my own. I saw it again and was amazed. I found the film to be powerful, extraordinarily disturbing, dense with period texture and a real horror masterpiece. The psychological narrative was not some modern re-imagining of a mindset plagued by superstition, but an historical reconstruction of an authentic, period world-view which was dramatically and brilliantly played-out - it is eerily effective.

The cinematography is Oscar-caliber, and the soundtrack and sound design are top-notch. It kept me in a constant state of dread for its entire runtime. You need to watch this in the dark and in complete silence. You cannot talk through this film. It requires complete immersion. I'm very confused by the 1-star reviews I'm seeing. I can only conclude that these people do not have much of an attention span, or don't have much of a horror palate. Or, they've been conditioned to expect cheap scares like the scary face moment in Insidious. The Witch doesn't rely on jump moments, and to me that's a great thing. In the horror movie canon, I can think of a few jump scares that feel earned and really enhance the scene, but they are a small minority of the total. Some good ones would include the monster reveal in The Descent or the alien jumping out in the access tunnel in Alien. Most jump scares aren't like that. They're in the film to create fake tension. Unfortunately, I believe many moviegoers have come to expect the rush of adrenaline that comes with a jump scare and have come to associate this with the horror experience. I would urge the people giving it 1 star to watch a lot more horror films and try to really gain some knowledge about the genre, and then come back and watch this one again.

imdb_the_witch_bankofmarquis_20160305,The Witch,IMDb,bankofmarquis,2016-03-05,6,Fascinating and Disturbing,"Some of the earliest settlers to America were religious fanatics - The Puritans - who believed in strict, joyless adherence to their principles. One byproduct of this strictness was the growing belief that the Devil, through Witches, would possess the pure in order to lead them to wicked ways. This fanatical belief in witches led to the famous Salem Witch Trials of the late 1690's. Director/Writer Robert Eggers, then, asked the question in his film THE WITCH - ""What if these fables and folk stories of witches were, in fact, true""? The result is a fascinating and disturbing film that doesn't flinch in showing the supposed results of Witchcraft. Is it a good film...not really. It's a little too slow and the Olde Engish language used is tough to follow (lots of ""thee's"" and ""thou's"") and, ultimately, the tale of a Puritan family's unraveling at the hands of the Witch is, as I have stated earlier, fascinating and disturbing to watch, but is it entertaining? Not really. Is it a bad film...definitely not. It is a strongly made film by writer/director Eggers who is better know as a Production Designer and it shows, as the production values are strong and consistent, but the plot is weak (there really isn't a plot, except that the Witch is tormenting the family) and none of the family is particularly easy to root for. So, do I recommend this film? Ultimately, I don't think so. I've used the words fascinating and disturbing quite a bit in this review and that is what this movie is...but entertaining?

A highly zealous puritan family in New England circa 1630 is banished from a large settlement and forced to live on their own in the uncharted spooky woods that surround the area. A year later as they forge a living together out in the wilderness, something begins to act on all of them, something devious, wicked, and insidious. Their oldest child, a daughter named Tomasin played remarkably by Anya Taylor-Joy, is taking care of the new-born baby when it is snatched away. Almost immediately an unspoken change occurs between her and the rest of the family especially between her parents played strongly by Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie. They begin to act strange around her, seemingly suspecting her of the deed and perhaps something more nefarious. But do they really believe that she is in some way responsible? Is she completely innocent or in fact turning into something from folklore and scripture? This stunning debut from writer/director Robert Eggers is a tense-atmospheric- historical drama centering on the fringes on hardened belief, the unexplained and supernatural, and the maddening hysteria that can come from all of them crossing- over into each other. Set some 60 years before the infamous Salem Witch Trials, Eggers has seemingly traced the root causes of the tragedy, most notably with the extremely pious that anything beyond their understanding is an affront to God; the core of their beliefs. The victims of this infamous Witch Hunt tragically unable to plead their innocence against the tide of fear and paranoia that griped their towns, neighbors and families. Anya Taylor-Joy as Tomasin plays the ostracized girl with doe-eyed innocence, but with fleeting glimmers that something may not in fact be right with her, supernatural forces notwithstanding. She is growing into maturity, suddenly experiencing changes both physical and emotional and because of the distancing she is feeling from her family she is coping with them on her own. Only her brother Caleb, played powerfully by Harvey Scrimshaw, seems to even be able to reach out to her, nonetheless an uncomfortable undertone to their relationship develops that further divides the family. As family members begin to suspect one another of evil tidings, the grey New England skies seemingly become darker, their farm animals begin to act wildly and the very woods themselves take on a menacing presence. Getting to the point where even a wild hare is as unsettling sight as the titular Witch on-screen. That is masterful horror cinema, akin to Polanski and Kubrick, generating an constant oppressive atmosphere of dread. The horror genre is experiencing a welcomed resurgence in that last few years with the likes of The Conjuring,The Babadook, It Follows, because the filmmakers carefully take the time to portray their worlds from an oft-kilter perspective. To take a line from the Bard ""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark"". Something is wrong, we can't quite point it out, but something isn't right. That is what true horror is, derived from a primal fear of the unknown and unexplained. Horror genre filmmakers in recent years have tried to manufacture scares into what one can call Shock cinema. Trying to put ""frightening"" images and gore on-screen and using jump-scares to try an jolt their audiences into thinking for an instant ""Well, that was scary."" While that may work for amusement park rides, film is a completely different beast. It is able to grant a unique perspective and understanding of the nature of fear. Nothing should be on-screen to shock an audience, at least in the cheap thrills department. You can be unsettled and disturbed by what is happening in the narrative certainly, but as part of the film's experience you should be trying to understand why you are feeling that way. The Witch is the crown-jewel in the recent string of truly disturbing horror films. A darkly beautiful film shot by Jarin Blaschke that treats its New England forest setting in a suffocatingly claustrophobic manner. The production design team render period authenticity from the cloths, lodgings and especially the 17th century style of English- speaking that may be hard for some to follow but the dedicated performances keep you engaged and concerned. The eerie musical score by Mark Korven makes the haunted woods seemingly sing not unlike the monolith in 2001. All these outstanding cinematic elements compliment one another to create a vision of hysteria that would manifest itself in real-world horrific ways in the area's history. At my screening just as the end credits appeared, another member of the audience cried out ""That's it? What was that?"" in a unsatisfied tone. ""What was that"" indeed, I guess we never really truly grasp what lies waiting for us in the darkness when we journey to the edges of what we're used to. 9.5/10 (An unsettling film that depicts the primal fear of the unknown in uniquely disturbing ways. An atmospheric horror film that has truly terrifying historical roots in the real-world, and never cheapens its storytelling for an audience.)",853,7,6,False

imdb_the_witch_johnmkates_20170131,The Witch,IMDb,johnmkates,2017-01-31,10,Quintessential 21st Century Horror,"The Witch (VVitch) is one goddamned scary movie, and it's not because of cheap thrills and jump-cuts galore. This is a movie that buries itself deep into your psyche, slowly builds up as a monster movie as well as something along the lines of a psychological thriller. In an era when it seems like horror has little more to contribute, here comes a movie that packs a punch comparable to great modern films like The Babadook. It's an undated time when America is barely colonized. A small family is banished from the city for religious betrayal or some such thing. It's hard to know for sure especially as the opening shot is of the magistrates of the town sentencing the family to leave at once. We see the reactions of the father's children. They are young, confused, willing to follow their parents and yet unsure of what the implications are. With little more than a wagon loaded, the family departs and sets up a small farm on the edge of a dark forest. Al is well. If you have seen the trailer, you know the general feel of the film. What surprised me was how quickly the film jumped into the thick of the terror, as the infant baby is kidnapped before their oldest daughter's eyes. Perhaps it was a wolf, and through frantic searches, they give up hope as the baby is known to be dead by either animals or hunger. The next- youngest, a set of twins who playfully run throughout the farm, claim to know stories of 'the witch of the wood.' It's laughed off. When I recall to mind great horror movies, I think of moments that catch you off guard, where you as an audience member are generally frightened for what is about to happen. These movies follow no clichéd plot lines nor are they predictable by any means. In The Witch, I was led on a journey that was so terrifying if only because the audience knows something that the family does not: there is a witch, indeed. Our first introduction to her is a scene so disturbing and eerie that my mouth hung open the entire scene. It's not long after the baby goes missing. There are a few shots as we see the witch mostly in shadows, as she goes about business that takes fear to a new level. The imagery coupled with some extremely Kubrick-ian music (think 2001: A Space Odyssey), this becomes a film so drenched with tone and darkness that it draws your attention even in the quietest of scenes. I really don't want to say too much more about the story, except that the family grows to suspect the eldest daughter for a variety of coincidental reasons. Though we know there is a satanic force lurking in the trees, the majority of the films turns inward as we watch a family devoted to God unravel with suspicion and fear. It's a believable family, with the father a kind and compassionate man, his wife God-fearing and unhinged, and children that are raised to know little more than good versus evil and His Holy Word. Robert Eggers directed and wrote the film in an astonishing debut as a filmmaker. There is a confidence in his style that already feels like it comes from a master. The performances he draws out of his small cast (especially the children) are remarkable, and at times this feels like a movie that is already a classic in the horror genre. My sole concerns (and deductions in the rating) come from the film's ending, one that feels cheap and unneeded for a movie so layered with style. It's a film that uses no special effects until the very last moments, and even then, was it really necessary? The final moments also contain a reveal that shows the truth hidden throughout the entire film, and even then, perhaps a bit of ambiguity wouldn't have hurt. The Babadook. It Follows. The Witch. Year after year we have seen a select group of films that simply redefine psychological horror, and they are few and far between. The trailers beforehand included two or three movies billed as being scary yet appear to be little more than slasher films with buckets of gore and fake blood. When will filmmakers learn that it isn't blood that frightens an audience, it is the unknown. Do not miss this movie.",737,9,9,False

This is also one of those movies that has a bit of a slow build up. However, it is ALL necessary. For whatever reason, now-a-days people just want all things RIGHT NOW and in a hurry. Give me action! Give me gruesome! Give me the feels... but in order to hit you right between the kisser just right, there needs to be some ground work laid. This movie does that. The other challenge is the period which this movie takes place: 1630. Not the most exciting nor technological times. What this movie does quickly is establish main characters and jumps right into plot. It lets you know that this movie is focusing just on this family. While there's mention of other people, you don't really care. The few main characters all add something good to this gumbo. The art direction and cinematography are brilliant in setting tone, mood, direction and capturing the essence of the suspense, struggle and mysteries that seemingly plague this family. And then... there's that creep factor. On a scale of 1-10, I'd easily give this movie an 8 for 3 reasons. #1. This movie is based off of written accounts. Whaaaaaat?? #2. This is one of those movies that uses kids in that RIGHT way to slap you with effect. #3. This is not your cute little Bewitched or Sabrina the Teenage witch kind of stuff. This is the kind of witch you had nightmares about and made you not want to go back to sleep, ever. The only reason I give this a 7 and not higher is because it lacks some depth and isn't quite unique, but is an original ""witch"" movie in my opinion. The Witch kind of reminds me of The Village and Wicker Man, but better than both combined and multiplied by 5. The build up isn't for everyone as mentioned above, but may take a bit to get through. Additionally, I'm not the reviewer to give out that covenant 10 or even 9 very easily. But, this movie does have a lot going for it and worth the watch if you want a good creep-out or horror movie.

If you don't believe in witches, then this is kind of for you (except the last 5 minutes, which I will not talk about). It makes a compelling case for how people pushed to the edge deal with tragedy and mystery. They live at the edge of the wilderness (not sure where, maybe Northern New England, since there are wolves at hand). They face starvation and hard work and lots of cloudy, rainy days. It's gloomy. But they have God and religion--a very well written version of loving and fearing God and believing in Jesus and yet finding things they can't explain. Hence witchcraft, which means that some one or more people in the group are causing the problem through sorcery. It's pretty vivid stuff. Sometimes it veers into excess--a lot of gore and screaming, which might be okay if you like horror films, but if you don't it's the one difficult part. This is a great addition to movies about the Salem witch trials. And it's an inroduction to the up and coming Anya Joy-Taylor in the lead role.

imdb_the_witch_coventry_20160926,The Witch,IMDb,Coventry,2016-09-26,6,Danger! Evil-staring Lagomorphs,"I got intrigued by the premise of ""The Witch"", like many others with me I presume, because it's allegedly based on authentic writings and immigrant stories from the actual era in which it takes place; namely New England in the 17th Century! Far too few horror stories take place in the Middle-Ages, if you ask me, and - at least to my recollection - the existing ones are only loosely inspired on contemporary historical milestones, like the several interpretations of the infamous Salem witch trials in 1692. The tale of ""The Witch"" is situated much earlier in that same dark century – in the year 1630 - and focuses on a family that gets banished to the far edge of the community, to a farm right next to an ominous forest, where they gradually get confronted with occult occurrences, so the least you can say about the concept is that it is original. The first reviews that I read on the internet or in specialized magazines were also very stimulating, as they practically unanimously agreed that ""The Witch"" is indescribably atmospheric and petrifying. Having seen the film now, I can definitely concur ""The Witch"" is most certainly a unique experience when it comes to eerie atmosphere. Literally from start to finish, writer/director Robert Eggers creates a gloomy and foreboding ambiance that makes you uncomfortable and keeps you on the edge of your seat, even when there's basically nothing happening at all. The slow pacing, integer character drawings, bleak performances and silent but sinister extended shots of the forest and treetops all contribute enormously to the mounting of the tension, but there was one element in particular that personally struck me as ultimately macabre and innovative. Robert Eggers and his obviously multi-talented cinematographer Jarin Blaschke excel in filming ordinary animals but simultaneously making them come across as extremely menacing and even pure evil, like the goat – Black Philip – but especially also the uncannily staring hare! Can you imagine After literally having seen and reviewed thousands of horror movies, I honestly never had thought that I would get uncomfortable from looking straight into the penetrating eyes of a rabbit! Unfortunately, the atmosphere and these unique peaks of suspense are the only true strongpoints of ""The Witch"" (apart maybe also from the solid performances). The plot, even though compelling and full of potential, is too thin while the continuous biblical speeches & dialogs are somewhat unnerving (although I surely reckon that the religious overtone is inseparably linked to the era). Since even the tense atmosphere is something you get used to quite rapidly, the lack of an actual plot and narrative structure causes the film to become soporific. To simply label ""The Witch"" as a period horror piece would also be unjust, as it much more qualifies as a harrowing drama, particularly during the many scenes where the family loses another child or gets torn apart due to (false?) witchcraft accusations. Being a father of a newborn child myself, the sudden and inexplicably mysterious disappearance of baby Samuel had a more than nightmarish effect on me. All this and more (style, casting choices, period recreation ) to at least ensure us that Robert Eggers is a promising and out-of-the-ordinary young director to keep an eye on! That same goes for the naturally beautiful and gifted young actress Anya Taylor-Joy.",558,3,7,False
imdb_the_witch_quinoa1984_20160218,The Witch,IMDb,Quinoa1984,2016-02-18,10,gets under your skin and haunts you,"Sometimes you can't believe what you're seeing in a cineplex that will more than likely only show the latest from the major studios. A film like The Witch or most other films from the studio A24 - mostly (if not all) done independently and then picked up for distribution - such as Under the Skin or Springbreakers, would normally be relegated to some art-house theater where not many people could see it. But unlike some distributors who think in only day-and-date theatrical/VOD (or just VOD only), A24 puts something like The Witch as basically a mainstream release (needless to say I saw the trailer for months, many times, in front of big horror and other releases). But I love that a film that goes for being all about simply scaring you by its brooding imagery, period dialog and actors who you won't know unless you have every cast member of Game of Thrones memorized (hint, it's the parents), gets to be seen by so many people. It's not about silly jump scares or characters who are idiots... well, not in the sense of the usual teenagers, but let's get to what I mean. This is all about witchcraft, but it's also not the simple 'riding around on broomsticks' shenanigans or anything that comes close to being jokey. Filmmaker Robert Eggers (which is all the more astonishing as it's the director's *debut*) suffuses his actors and crew into a setting that is unmistakably 17th century New England, and it's from here everything else can be conjured up. His story follows a family of Puritans from England who are cast out from their community (we don't know why, no real need to, except that the father and mother are, to say the least, very religious, even for the Puritans!) They set up a farm and are preparing for a long season until they can grow their crops. They have a bunch of kids, an teenage daughter, an adolescent boy, two twins and a baby. Right at the start the baby is taken by... who? What? Sometimes having some ambiguity can work in a film's favor to make the horror from the story and place even more potent. There's not too much ambiguity with The Witch (unless someone wants to warp around things to their liking, or found something I don't know), and it's clear: there is some real heavy-duty black magic going on in the nearby woods, and whether the spirits (in human and animal form) come to the family because they're religious or just because they're evil beings that like to slather themselves with blood is a little more open to interpretation. And in less confident hands it could have become schlocky or unconvincing, set in a period so that either monotonous imagery could unfold (it could have easily been a too-hard-to-take pace wise effort) or all about the special gore effects. Eggers finds the sweet middle ground, and creates a portrait of a family undone by their own religious fervor, while also being true to what were, at the time, historical accounts of witchcraft. Whether those carried much creedence, Eggers doesn't care - he commits to showing these woods and showing something like a goat or even an apple as something deathly serious, and yet loaded with significance. He doesn't move the camera around like crazy, and of course he doesn't need or should have to: the production design is among the greatest in any horror film, not to mention the certain color palette that he and DP Blaschke give to every shot so that it's like the world is drained of color - grays are even grayer, browns dirtier, and blacks somehow much blacker. It's a serious, darkly directed film, but there's always an intensity about it that doesn't make it ponderous to a point that takes one out of the movie. A large part to why the film is so effective and chilling is the acting. The main adults (Ineson and Dickie, rarely below a 10 emotionally speaking, though Dickie has the trickier role as the one who has to try, up to a point, to keep his wits about him) are very strong here, both playing variations on God-petrified mortals, but the movie for me really belongs to Anya Taylor-Joy (her first major movie role, expect to see her in many things to come) and Scrimshaw as Caleb. For the former, she has to carry many scenes all based on why she is a trustworthy person, and she sells it, while for the latter, this boy, it's a role that needs someone to play the period dialog (which is only occasionally obfuscated by the accents) and having to be genuinely scared to death when faced with the evils in the woods. When you have characters who are both ""simple"" folk of the Lord while also being capable of being twisted by the same dark forces they can't escape, you need people to sell it. They all do, to lengths not unlike out of Polanski at his fiercest. So combine a filmmaker who wants to make Dread with a capital D his priority, a setting and location and things like just a barn or a door that feel eerie and ominous, and actors who dig in to characters who could very well destroy one another due to their fears (except for Thomasin), and you got a unique genre piece that works just as well as drama as horror, if not better.",913,18,25,False

What did anyone find the least bit redeeming in this wretched film? Based on the previews I was expecting a frightening, exciting, tense movie about, oh I don't know, a witch!?!? Instead I was subjected to 90 minutes of a family's extreme religious superstition tearing them apart. OK, that's not necessarily bad for subject matter, but since everyone speaks in different accents and variations of 17th century English (ye, thee, thou, whilst, etc.) at wildly varying volume levels, I probably missed a good 40-50% of what was said. But what upset me the most was how the film existed in the world of plausibility for the majority of the time and then suddenly shifted into fantasy and the supernatural. Far too many WTF moments that I would have to spoil to enumerate. But just when you think you are dealing with the effects of religious extremism and how it can poison a person's mind, suddenly you get slammed with images of pure folklore fantasy and all you can do is scratch your head and wonder what the heck is going on. It's been a long time since a film has made me want to walk out in disgust. I give The Witch two stars because of the acting performances. The cast had some horrible material to work with but they did a wonderful job of expressing their emotions, fears and doubts about each other's faith.

It's actually a slow-burning, elegant dark fairytale dripping with a uniquely eerie, dreadful atmosphere and effectively brought to life by realistic characters. For his first feature film, director and writer Robert Eggers did extensive research on the 17th-century witchcraft folklore and puritan lifestyle. He went for a minimalistic approach, preferring realistic and crude staging over costume drama glamour and gothic cinema cliches. Everything is shot with natural lighting and little frills, yet each frame is haunting, poetically beautiful, blending perfectly with the supernatural elements. Visual effects and gore are kept minimal, yet there are a lot of genuinely disturbing moments. The approach and taste are modern, yet the style, pacing, and aesthetics somehow remind of classic cinema a la Bergman and Herzog. The plot is simple and predictable: an outcast puritan family sets up a farm near the woods where a coven of witches lives. Needless to say, the witches cannot wait to get their hands on the children. You kind of know what is going to happen while you watch, and there is no mystery to solve. Everything is clear from the beginning, but what matters here is how the film manages to create a particular atmosphere and empathy for the characters through tasteful visual storytelling. The relationships between the six family members, the way superstition and faith in God manage to pull all the strings even before the witches actually come into play. You can't help feeling bad for all of them. The acting is good and natural, bringing out the dramatic tone of the dialogues without cheapening the lines. Subtitles or earphones are highly recommended for non-native speakers as it's easy to miss many nuances. The film starts a bit too slow and verbose indeed, but the pacing gets a little better in the second half. Still, it will not give you what you want if you are looking for an entertaining film full of special effects, action and gore. Go for it only if you are into psychological and contemplative cinema. It lacks that unconventional, groundbreaking thing that a true masterpiece needs, but it's definitely one of the most elegant horror films out there, and a great directorial debut for Robert Eggers.",385,6,5,False

imdb_the_witch_hey_sweden_20160603,The Witch,IMDb,Hey_Sweden,2016-06-03,8,A cut above a lot of other modern horror.,"A God fearing family manages to end up banished from their village in 17th Century New England. They decide to set up cabin and ranch at the edge of a truly spooky forest. Their troubles are only beginning when their adorable newborn son Samuel disappears without a trace. And a lot of the blame is laid at the feet of the teen aged daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). We never ever see very much of the title character in this effort by writer & director Robert Eggers. He chooses to parcel out his true horror rather carefully, instead focusing on creating a mood and atmosphere that is absolutely stifling. His film is somber, serious, and even depressing. It's definitely not for all tastes. It sets a tone in a sequence approximately eight minutes in, involving Samuel. This will cause ""The Witch"" to lose some viewers, for sure, but all I can say in Eggers' defense is that he spares us the goriest details. Eggers was inspired by a variety of folklore, fairy tales (I can certainly see a ""Hansel & Gretel"" influence), and records of settlers during this time in North American history. His *very* literate dialogue is often taken from these records. The dialogue and its delivery is therefore highly antiquated, so that's one other thing that some viewers might not care for. But it's refreshing that Eggers takes such a careful, measured approach to telling a tale that could be referred to as ""slow burn"" horror. The look for this picture is perfect; its drab visuals are very suitable to the story being told. But don't worry; there is some gore here and there. The performances are incredibly sincere and intense. Taylor-Joy has tremendous appeal in the lead role. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are superb as the parents. Harvey Scrimshaw delivers a mature performance as the son Caleb. Bathsheba Garnett has such a creepy presence in her seconds of screen time as the true form of the Witch. And the goat Black Phillip manages to be quite the character too, especially towards the end. Overall, an interesting fable open to some interpretation, with many themes and questions of faith throughout. Eight out of 10.",366,11,13,False

I remember the first time I saw this film I thought it was great, and then I walked out of the theater and went about my day, but that final image kept creeping into my mind, infecting the dark corners of my room as I lay waiting for sleep. The implications of those last images are truly, in every sense of the word, horrifying, but more on that later; the rest of the film does an almost perfect job of building a world that feels infringed upon by evil on all sides, creating a place of apparent solace that is still rife with corruption.

The devil prowls the earth.""","Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" now replaces my all-time favorite horror film (previously Robert Wise's 1963, ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris, now a little dated). What the two do have in common is a literary-mindedness, fine performances, superior cinematography, and that which is new and strange, that is, nothing is predictable. In the case of ""The Haunting"" sexual repression, loneliness and maybe a psychotic heroine; for ""The Witch,"" sexual tension from single room living as well as a religious repression, a dark foreboding wood, and a landscape unfamiliar to the inhabitant, that is, a New World. In both cases, an ignorance that needs some kind of definition so fear/panic can be managed. Ignorance is usually at the heart of the supernatural, but both films manage to convince the audience there is some kind of actual unknown force threatening the characters. Eggers researched cases from the 1600's prior to the infamous Salem witch trials. Using court documents and lore, he's put together a convincing logic for what happens during the course of ""The Witch,"" whether it be contaminated food, starvation or isolation born out of new surroundings or expulsion from society. The spookiness creeps in slowly. The personality quirks of the family explain a lot. Never before have two ""twins"" been more cause for alarm than Mercy and Jonas and their ""pet"" goat Black Phillip. The use of archaic language both Christian incantation (and other darker forms of religion) really raise the hackles. When Mercy and Jonas taunt an untethered Black William (a goat) with repetitious rhyme, I wanted to flee. But family members are stuck with them, and tensions build in their new surroundings as various significant and insignificant mysteries begin, and alarm and panic consume the family where no one is trusted and blame comes quickly to the lips, causing more and more tension. As pioneers, they are living on the margin of survival, in and of itself terrifying. What happens in the wood is both beautiful and fraught. Jarin Blaschke's painterly cinematography draws us in to the drama, as does the careful costuming and production design. The film harkens back to the work of Carl Theodore Dreyer's 1920 ""Leaves from Satan's Book,"" and masterful exploration of occult throughout his long career. But it's the music that pushes this over the edge. Mark Korven's dissonant chorale and seemingly period instruments are as unfamiliar to us as the surroundings are for the family, driving us as mad as the fear that inhabits the characters. All of this is accomplished in an almost casual way. But slowly the injection of the unknown and fear of it, consumes us without the usual tricks that have become so familiar (and anything-but-scary) the many horror films that are cranked out by the industry. ""The Witch"" is different which is bold enough. But it's also accomplished in what it sets out to do and earns a very special place in the canon of horror films.",489,7,7,False

I do remember watching the trailer back prior to the movie came out and was intrigued. The story in ""The VVitch"" was plagued by a horribly slow storytelling, and it didn't really help that almost next to nothing happened throughout the course of the entire movie. It was only towards the last quarter of the movie or so, that the movie started to pick up pace and things started to happen. One thing that did work in favor of the movie was the acting performances put on by the cast. The actors and actresses were really doing good jobs with their given roles, despite having a limited script and storyline to work with. There was a really good and realistic atmosphere to the movie, and it definitely seemed like it was quite true to the time period in which the movie was set to take place. And the costume, props and sets were quite convincing, adding a lot of flavor and detail to the movie. ""The VVitch"" didn't fall into my liking, because it was just too slow paced, and the ending of the movie didn't sit well with me either. This was somewhat of an acquired taste of a movie by the hands of writer and director Robert Eggers, and I believe that having an interest in the time period and particular aspect of American history that ""The VVitch"" is set to take place in is a definite must to fully enjoy this movie.

imdb_the_witch_squigglycrunch_20160925,The Witch,IMDb,SquigglyCrunch,2016-09-25,10,Absolutely Riveting,"The Witch, or as I prefer to write it, The VVitch, follows a family as they are exiled from their home city and settle on a new plot of land where they are haunted by what they believe to be a witch from the woods. I went into this movie knowing it was slow, particularly the first 20-30 minutes. However, I didn't find this to be the case at all. Maybe this was because I mentally prepared myself for the beginning or maybe not, I don't know. But I'd suggest preparing for a slow movie right off the bat. Everything about this movie is pretty phenomenal. To start, the acting is spot-on. Every character is almost perfect, with the exception of one or two points with the child actors. But even then it wasn't terrible, it was just not as good as everything else. For the most part the child actors were great. Every line of dialogue is very well delivered, despite the fact that it's an old way of talking. Every actor seems to feel each line of dialogue and made it genuine and real, which I haven't seen at all in these kinds of movies. The writing is, while done in a way from the 1630s, easy enough to understand while still maintaining that accuracy. It requires the audience to pay attention to what they're seeing to properly understand it, but it's not too terribly complex, nor is the story complicated or requiring you to understand every single word to know what's going on. The movie actually has a very original concept. It takes a relatively unoriginal general idea/type of horror and makes it something original. The VVitch is more of a family drama caused by the result of a witch hanging out in the woods. And in that way it makes the characters realistic and relatable, but it's also something we don't see every day. Its a realistic, relatable horror movie that shows the effect that an element of horror has on a family. Of course, part of making a good horror movie is making it scary, and this one succeeds on that level as well. It doesn't cater to all the typical horror tropes, but instead goes for subtlety. It's a slow- burn horror, so naturally the horror is few and far between, but thanks to the immense build up of tension and curiosity throughout the film every reveal or bit of horror is all the more effective. The movie is mostly straightforward, but there is plenty that isn't explained. It requires you as the audience to think just a little to completely understand the movie, which I appreciated. The movie doesn't just spoon-feed you all the information you need to be completely satisfied. It treats the audience like a bunch of capable-of-comprehension people and allows you to figure stuff out on your own. Again, it's not like it's overly complicated though, it's pretty easy to understand. The ending was pretty great too. Without any actual words, the movie manages to communicate a lot about the story to the audience. Plus it's just creepy and messed up, and that's always to be appreciated in a horror. To top all this off, the movie has a great look. The shots, especially at the beginning, are beautiful. While they do die down towards the second and third act, the entire set is just so cool to look at that every shot is a scenic one. But as far as visuals go, it's not just in scenery. The set itself looks fantastic, and the costumes are spot on. I rarely notice these things, but dang, the costumes were good. Apparently they were even made from the same materials and patterns from the time, and it certainly shows. I got so into this movie that about half an hour in when I wanted more pizza I didn't want to get up to get some, nor did I want to pause the movie. I didn't want to break the momentum of the story, and I didn't want to miss anything. So I sacrificed pizza for this movie. Eventually my friend paused the movie, at which point I grabbed the rest of an entire pizza and and took it with me to finish the movie. I wasn't going to going to risk going hungry again. The movie managed to steal my appetite by the third act though. It wasn't gross, it was just unsettling. Overall The VVitch is fantastic. It's got great actors, great characters, great writing, an original concept, a great ending, and is overall a great movie to look at. I absolutely loved this movie. It's easily one of the best of the year, maybe even the best of the year. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie, so long as your not going in expecting your typical garbage horror flick.",812,7,7,False

imdb_the_witch_kim_smoltz_20180416,The Witch,IMDb,kim_smoltz,2018-04-16,8,Like a nightmarish bedtime story,"From the moment the film begins, you're trapped in a spider web of dread. This is the tale of a deeply religious English pilgrim family who is exiled from their community, and made to start over alone in the countryside with nothing. From there, things go from bad to worse. That's all I should tell you about plot. For right now, let's talk about the overall aesthetic of the movie. ""The Witch"" is one of the most deliriously gorgeous films I've ever seen, owing most to its impeccable direction and production design. This is a movie that could potentially unseat ""Eraserhead"" as the most atmospherically bleak, unsettling, tense, and hopeless film ever (okay, at least for me). The experimental, string-based score ropes everything together -- deafening crescendos are shuffled with uneasy undertones and moments of paralyzing silence. The acting is excellent on all fronts; my only slight complaint being Ralph Ineson's overall diction, which seemed forced at times and occasionally muddled his line delivery. But for all intents and purposes, this is an incredible movie. The reason for my 8/10 and not any higher is because it just isn't accessible to most people. Despite its stunning design and direction, many will be left unsatisfied or feeling stupid because they feel like they don't ""get it."" Probably like you, I hate movies that make me feel stupid. When I saw ""The Witch"" in theaters when it first came out, I felt stupid. I thought the movie was terrifying, but I felt stupid. After a rewatch two years later, I finally understood why it's so scary, and why none of us should feel stupid, whether you've already seen it or not. I'll explain. This is a movie that has been lambasted for being ""slow,"" ""boring,"" and having little to no discernible plot or explanation. While the film is admittedly a slow burn, you have to be prepared for what you're getting into. The hint is in the movie's subtitle: ""A New England Folktale."" That's exactly what this is -- it's a period piece, and a culmination of extensive research into the behaviors and speech of 17th century settlers in New England (look for an interview with director Robert Eggers with the British Film Institute). Much of the script is in an early-modern dialect, which can be confusing at times. Some of the themes could initially be dismissed as laughable; for example, the idea of a witch stealing an infant being both fathomable and deeply horrifying. It's easy to see why many wouldn't be engaged by this movie beyond its production qualities. But we mustn't forget -- this is the era of Puritans and the Salem trials. Let's get some context. The correct mindset to watch this film in is thinking about it as an experience similar to reading ""Macbeth"" in high school. The cool thing about early-modern literature is that we all experienced it the same way -- whether we're currently 18 or 80, we all read that play in high school and were probably initially bored by it, despite understanding its importance. It's something that we imagine was probably terrifying and original a few hundred years back, but today seems stale. In truth, it was the written/oral product of King James I's obsession and fear of demonology and witchcraft. It was the real deal back then. Meanwhile, the Puritans are settling in New England because they don't think the Anglo-Catholics are taking God seriously enough. The seed of witch hysteria across the Atlantic is planted, and we all know how things go in Salem. The United States wasn't introduced to Shakespeare until the 1800s, long after this time period. But if they could've read/seen it, would ""Macbeth"" had been scary to the deeply religious Puritans? Maybe. What if they could experience a terrifying folktale as we experience movies today in the 21st century? Would they run screaming? Today's horror films that are watchable mostly use (or at least attempt to use) original ideas and themes. ""The Witch"" isn't that. It's a folktale. It's written and shot like one. This isn't ""It Follows;"" there is no deep, allegorical connection to be made. It's a bedtime story told to impressionable little children by candlelight. Dark folktales are never exactly masterpieces of plot and thematic structure, and this movie isn't one either. It has a very simple plot that isn't very scary (at least by modern standards). What's scary is the way it's delivered. Don't go into this movie like you're a snob and grasping at straws to develop ""hidden meanings"" or whatever. If you're really into film, this is probably ingrained in you whether you like it or not. Get rid of it before watching this. There is no hidden meaning to this film. It's not pretentious -- you're just thinking too hard. Relish in the atmosphere. Go where the film takes you, even if it's confusing or nonsensical. It's okay to be confused.

In the past, I have enjoyed slow-burn horror movies such as ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Anti-Christ"" tremendously, and ""The Witch"" appears to be in the same league. However, after watching this movie several times, I cannot help but feel like it leaves much to be desired. Overall, is it a terrific movie? I do not think so. It is enjoyable but not that great. I really wanted to like this movie but I simply cannot. Allow me to explain myself (mild spoilers ahead so please continue at your own risk). First of all, let me discuss the PROS. + The female lead Thomasin is the brightest gem of the movie. The actress did a fantastic job portraying a naïve, pure, struggling yet strong and loving teenage daughter. I could not help but feel pity and sympathetic for her and the situations that she was pulled into. In my opinion, any actress that can provoke such a feeling from the audience deserves praise. + The twins Jonas and Mercy are also well-acted. They did exactly what they were supposed to do: be an annoying and hellish pair. I felt very uneasy whenever they delivered their lines or sang their Satanic songs. They create some pretty strong hatred in me right off the bat. Again, in my opinion, this is terrific because it shows that the actors know what they are doing by invoking the right emotion response from the audience. Now, I will discuss the CONS. + The choice of speech: this movie suffers from poor choice of speech/dialects. The director chooses to use Old English in this movie to give it a more realistic feel. I think this is fine in itself. However, I feel like this choice has backfired. And the actors' talking manner does not help either. They sound incoherent and some of their conversations just do not flow well. More on this later. A lot of the dialogues are very hard to understand. I had to turn on the subtitles and I still had problems following some of what they are trying to say. First, I thought maybe the problem was because I was not a native speaker but then, I found out that even native speakers had trouble understanding the speech in this movie. + The mother: this character, in my opinion, is a failed attempt and really impaired the experience. Early on, the audience know that she is in pain due to the mysterious disappearance of her infant child. The audience are supposed to feel sorry for her and sympathize with her behaviors. However, I doubt anyone could pity her because she had very little character- development. All she does in this movie is be unreasonable, grieve, and complain in a high-pitched voice. Her speech is also incoherent because she 1) speaks too fast, 2) jumps from one point to another without using any conjunction, and 3) ends her sentences abruptly. I find her voice and character to be increasingly irritating upon repeated viewings. + The pace: for a horror movie, this movie lacks scare scenes. While I do appreciate how the director took time to deliver some good unnerving scenes, this movie is too slow and fails to keep the audience anticipated. It has almost no scary moments until the very end. And even then, the scenes are not that scary except for one or two of them (the crow being the best scene of the entire movie, in my opinion). I firmly believe that a few more scary moments and a less slow pace would help the movie tremendously. In summary, this movie is decent. It is in no way a mindless average horror movie, but it is not that great either. I give it a 6/10. PS: Sorry for any bad English in my review.",649,1,1,False
imdb_the_witch_raphaellecat_20181104,The Witch,IMDb,raphaellecat,2018-11-04,9,"""who be the witch of the wood?""","A triumphant debut for director Robert Eggers who crafts a terrifying exercise in slow-building horror with The Witch, perhaps the year's most daunting watch. The story centers around a family in 1630s New England as they are haunted by supernatural forces such as witchcraft, black magic and possession. The first thing Robert Eggers successfully establishes is the setting from which this takes place. An unbelievable achievement in what can only seem like the 17th century, the filmmaker captures not only the tone of such a life but incorporates a script that breathes a Shakespearean essence which further elevates the drama and heightens the horror. The Witch invitingly creates such a dreary and desolate mood that often times feels suffocatingly unbearable and yet remarkably compelling, it is as if the film itself uses supernatural forces to allure you, but that's just great filmmaking don't worry. The cast here are impeccable, consisting of only 6 actors, they immediately set an emotionality that will secure your investment for the rest of the running time. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are veterans who never miss a beat, even with terrific child actors lead by a superb newcomer, Anya Taylor-Joy, who perfectly seizes the accent and blend moments of drama with horror.

Their baby goes missing, presumably snatched by a wolf, but the children think something more sinister is going on.

The form of horror this film gives you is by taking you in the world of the characters - rather one character in particular - and the terror that gradually leads to the climax of the story. The bonds between the family members are pushed to the limit as they grow increasingly desperate and some become antagonistic to one another, charging each scene with a sense of profound unease, so you're never certain of what will happen next. That is the masterstroke of the film, the continual slow-burn tension and uncertainty that will keep the viewer disoriented and searching for concrete answers. The film pivots on metaphors, symbolism, period specific dialogue, and character choices to convey a representation of the biblical stories it centers around. Technically, this film is mind blowing; Production design successfully creates a sinister environment that reeks of evil, and the peripherals of the isolated surroundings only add more creepiness to the whole setting. The gorgeously looming and oppressively atmospheric cinematography, as well as the sweeping and dreary score, that often imitates what is happening on the screen, building tension to a crescendo that adds to the horror of this film. In terms of the performance, the ensemble cast does a fantastic job.

It's a film for lovers of real horror, not Hollywood horror, people who have a passion for art films filled with great cinematography will appreciate this movie. The stereotypical, mainstream movie goer who is hoping for jump scares and cliché horror plots will ultimately be disappointed. There is a scene within the first 15 minutes or so which is uncharacteristically brutal and gory. The rest of the movie doesn't resemble this level of horror and this scene will last in your memory long after the credits have rolled. This is a horror, there is no doubt about that, it just isn't a horror in the conventional way of the mainstream Hollywood movies. A devout Christian Family are banished from their plantation and set up home on farm on the edge of a woods, in the middle of nowhere. Before long, strange things start happening, their new-born seemingly vanishes into mid-air and their crops start to die out. We see the stress and strain take its toll as they slowly begin to turn on each other and become more and more emotionally unstable. Paranoia, hopelessness and resentment are all strong emotional factors and we truly get to see how these traumas can shake a family to the core. Their distress leaves them as a collection of individuals rather than a compact family, vulnerable to the evils within the forest. The Witch is a slow burner, a very slow burner. There were parts which I found boring and seemed to drag for no particular purpose. It is a very heavy dialogue driven movie with very little action; it focuses on the family and their relationships with each other much more than what is lurking in the forest. The acting has been praised very highly but I honestly didn't see it as that strong. I can appreciate that speaking in Old English was a challenge, especially for the child actors and this showed quite glaringly. The father of the family and the eldest daughter gave the strongest displays, both showcasing their emotions very well. The Witch has a fantastic score, the music used is perfect, capturing the old era and adding very strong tension. The music used with the breath-taking cinematography made for one very special looking movie. It is full of panoramic camera work, slow and drawn out shots which create tension and atmosphere perfectly. You never felt like there was going to be a jump scare as it is very obvious that it isn't that type of movie, but the tension is there nonetheless – it is essentially a very uneasy watch. Another strong aspect for me was the ending. I was watching the movie unravel, with underlying thoughts of how they would end this movie. I won't say too much as it's a spoiler free review but I was very, very impressed with how they did it. The very final scene was powerful and graphic, it ended in a way that felt very concluding way and ended in a climax of drama. I felt like I had an idea of what this movie was going to be like and I was completely wrong, leaving me at the time, slightly disappointed. I have since been able to appreciate The Witch for what it is and when I look back on it I can see how very impressive this movie actually is. I will be watching this again as I feel I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have upon my initial watch at the cinema. 7/10",610,2,5,False

imdb_the_witch_jadepietro_20160219,The Witch,IMDb,jadepietro,2016-02-19,6,Witchy Woman,"(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5) THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: The Crucible meets The Shining meets Rosemary's Baby in Robert Eggers' well- received but wildly overrated debut film. GRADE: C+ PLOT SUMMARY: Set in the 1600's, faith lends a shaky hand to a devout Christian patriarch and his family as they encounter strange occurrences in a small New England town. Labeled as heretics, the family is shunned by the community and settles near a dark forest with talks of witchcraft and other evil forces lurking about. JIM'S REVIEW: While the film is called The Witch, it is its subtitle, A New England Folktale, that reveals more about writer / director Robert Eggers' first film. Folktales were originally cautionary tales told to impressionable children to forewarn them of the dangers in the real world. The film uses its time and setting most ingeniously, recalling the religious repression of that period and the mass hysteria associated with sin and witchcraft in a Puritan village. It has also garnered the awe of many impressionable critics as well. While this psychological thriller has some strong and disturbing imagery, it cannot hide the many illogical twists in the plot that are more evident after the film reaches its unsatisfying conclusion. One is initially captivated by the story, production values, and acting as the film tells its tale of a family surviving on its own after being exiled by the community elders. There are strange satanic goings-on as they settle into the woods (a bad place to be in most fairy tale lore): daily fire and brimstone sermons from an arrogant shiftless father, William (Ralph Ineson), Katherine (Kate Dickie), a cold and hateful mother who seems more possessed than humanly possible, lustful glances by a confused son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), a pre-pubescent unhappy daughter, two creepy twins spouting evil talk, and a baby who goes missing. Nothing goes quite well for these outcasts. The atmosphere is indeed moody and eerie, although the pacing of the film is in need of some stirring. Eggers is a solid director, and a talent that shows much promise. He creates a wonderful setting with much historical accuracy and his penchant for occasional surreal images with black birds, goats, wild rabbits, and subtle uses of blood to accentuate the perils surrounding the family are haunting and very effectively done. The acting is uniformly strong. Mr. Ineson, sporting an anachronistic 21st century six-pack physique that could have tempted many a Puritan, handles the speechifying astutely and Ms. Dickie brings a sullen and disagreeable presence to her character, but it is the acting of the two younger members of the clan, namely Mr. Scrimshaw and Ms. Taylor-Joy who deliver the emotional connection needed to care about this stoic family and their creepy dilemmas. Yet, as the story progresses and more and more supernatural things befall these victims, the leaps of logic become harder to accept. Mr. Eggers' script ultimately lets down the audience. His flair for visuals compensates for a lack of cohesiveness in his screenplay. There is also an over-reliance of heightened sound effects and atonal musical cues that telegraphs something wicked before it comes this way. Just as folktales are themselves cautionary stories, The Witch may hold one's interest in its storytelling, but this reviewer must caution any moviegoer that this well-crafted tale will leave you more bothered or bewildered than bewitched.

imdb_the_witch_moviesarelife93_20160219,The Witch,IMDb,MoviesAreLife93,2016-02-19,9,A wicked masterpiece,"""The Witch"" is undoubtedly one of the most skillfully made horror movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. This movie excels on multiple levels: the performances, the cinematography, the score, art direction, production design - and above all - its unmatched uniqueness. I'm fully confident that this movie will be remembered for quite some time. Something so horrifying occurs during the first five minutes that we are 100% invested for the rest of the movie. We have seen this in the trailer: a young woman is playing peek-a-boo with her baby brother in an open field. Suddenly, the baby is snatched up by an invisible witch and taken deep into the woods. For the record, this movie does not attempt to leave the baby's fate up to question; we see everything. This is an incredibly bold move to make in the first five minutes, and it's frightening as hell. This is not a movie that relies on jump-scares or gore. Rather, it's a perfectly paced slow-burner. Through flawless directing, we are completely aware of how serious of a role religion played for people of this time period. This allows us to understand their overwhelming fear of witchcraft and evil. It wasn't a superstition to them, it was a reality. What makes this film so exceptional is that we are able to feel that fear for ourselves. We sympathize so much with the family on screen that it breaks our hearts to see them afflicted with so much fear. It feels like we are witnessing an incredibly convincing nightmare from 1630s New England. From start to finish, we are presented with so much vivid historical detail, that it's hard to look away from. The dialogue, the costume design, and the historical accuracy make the film all the more realistic. It legitimately feels like we are seeing the 1630s in-the-flesh; not one detail is missing. I highly recommend this movie - not just to horror fans, but to film-lovers everywhere. The sheer level of focus makes it unlike any other horror movie. The performances are so convincing that we see actual fear in the characters' eyes. Nothing looks fake. The score is eerie and deeply unsettling. The cinematography is hauntingly flawless. ""The Witch"" is never difficult to take seriously. It is all at once a perfect historical film, a heart-breaking drama, and - above all - a blood-curdling horror film.",399,8,9,False
imdb_the_witch_alexrwatson_888_169026_20160310,The Witch,IMDb,alexrwatson-888-169026,2016-03-10,7,"Slow-burning, Disturbing Horror Period Piece","The Witch is a horror film set in 17th century New England, and after a family's youngest child is taken into the forest under supernatural circumstances, paranoia challenges the family's Christian beliefs and threatens their lives in ways they never could have imagined. The Witch premiered at Sundance last year, and following rave reviews, has finally received a wide release. The Witch is a very different horror film that relies on atmosphere, disturbing imagery, and sound to craft a slow, but terrifying, horror experience. The story in The Witch takes familiar ideas of witchcraft and Satanism and puts them in an isolated setting with a family of six on the outskirts of the forest. The father and mother preach strict religious values, so after their youngest child goes missing, the family slowly begins to point fingers and the dark situation becomes a witch hunt within their own family. I liked this unique spin on witchcraft and demons, but I only wish the characters were more interesting. The mother and oldest daughter were the two most interesting characters, with the rest of the family being entirely forgettable. The dialogue is taken straight out of the 1600s, so while it is authentic, some lines and words are hard to make out. Because this dialogue is combined with thick accents and some characters mumbling, there were times were I was legitimately missing entire sentences. The Witch does explore some interesting themes for a horror film, like faith and isolation, which I appreciated. But most importantly in a horror film, is it scary? Yes, in chunks but not as consistently as I would have hoped. The scares are not jump-scares or anything like that. The scares are enhanced, and sometimes carried, by sound entirely. There are many times in The Witch where there is nothing on screen but the forest in the distance or a rabbit in the barn, but the sound gives you an unshakeable feeling that something terrible is about to happen. It's some of the best use of sound design I've seen in a horror film in some time. There's also some really disturbing imagery I can still visualize a day after seeing The Witch. The use of off-screen space is cleverly utilized to add to the more psychological moments. There are palpable moments of dread throughout, but after these sporadic moments, there are lengthy scenes of downtime with the family speaking to one another in the cabin. So while The Witch does have atmosphere, the pacing of the scares and the storytelling makes for a somewhat uneven film from start to finish. However, the final 10 minutes are so incredibly twisted and satisfying that it makes up for the slower moments up until that point. While I mentioned I was not in love with the characters in The Witch, the film uses the forest as a character itself, and very good one at that. The forest has an unmistakable presence and is completely captivating because of the potential darkness that lies within. Shooting on location with the forest and beautiful landscapes, combined with excellent costume design, results in a low-budget film that looks incredible. The cinematography is breathtaking, and I love the film's use of desaturated color to add to the dark tone. While The Witch is slow at points and some characters are not very engaging, I still found the film to be a beautiful and unique take on the horror genre. Not to mention the last 10 minutes will remain etched in my head for the foreseeable future. If a horror movie can affect a viewer for even a moment following it's conclusion, it's definitely worth a watch from any horror fans who thinks they can stomach lots of gore, mutilation, and goats?

imdb_the_witch_a_chinn_20181112,The Witch,IMDb,a_chinn,2018-11-12,9,Chilling slow burn horror chamber piece carefully balances psychological and supernatural horror,"Set in 1630s New England, a family that's been shunner by their community over a religious dispute is forced to move far into the forest on their own. The film is told from the perspective of the eldest daughter, Anya Taylor-Joy in a standout performance that's also her film debut, one day is watching her baby brother who mysteriously disappears before her very eyes. It's revealed that a witch has stolen the unbaptized child for a blood sacrifice. At that point, the family begins to suspect one another of consorting with the devil and practicing witchcraft, which is where things begin to unravel. First time writer/director Robert Eggers has made something of a minor masterpiece with this slow burn horror film that never quite comes out to explicitly state whether anything supernatural is happening or if it's all in the paranoia imaginations of it's characters. This isn't to say the film isn't scary, because it's scary as hell. Although not a standard jump-scare horror film in manner of ""The Conjuring"" or ""Paranormal Activity,"" Eggers delights in slowly building tension between characters and peppering it with some truly haunting and chilling imagery. When Taylor-Joy's younger twin siblings befriend a goat named Black Phillip, hold onto your horses! There are few films I would visually compare this too (Dante Tomaselli is possibly the only current horror filmmaker I might compare Eggers visual style of horror). It's shot primary using natural lighting and the camera is largely invisible in that it doesn't draw attention to itself with showy pans or zooms. It's primarily frightening and chilling static images that stick with you, whether it's Black Phillip striding through the forest, a red cloaked raven haired beauty becoming the viewer closer, or some of the more overt horror images I won't spoil here which may or may not be hallucinations or dreams. Eggers has stated the film is based on folktales, fairytales and written accounts of historical witchcraft, including journals, diaries, and court records, with much of the dialogue coming directly from these primary sources, which gives the film a sense of authenticity that's missing from many period films about witchcraft. Witches have long been a horror film staple, but they rarely come off well. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is likely the best film about witches and like this film, it rode a delicate balance between supernatural and psychological, but no film about witches has better captured the folktale/folklore elements of witchcraft than ""The Witch."" The silent film ""Häxan"" may be the only other film I can think of that possibly captures this period feel, but that silent film documentary style was quite different from a narrative form of storytelling. In ""The Witch,"" the imagery of a black goat with a broken horn, all the talk of ""signing the book,"" different animals which may or may not be familiars, talk of a witch's teat, or the plot point around an unbaptized child all feel straight out folklore and effectively tap into primal audience fears. The film also greatly benefits from a truly remarkable score by composer Mark Korven, who creates an unsettling dissonant soundtrack using a minimalist approach. Korven actually built his own original instruments to create some of the frightening and original sounds used for the film's score, which makes the soundtrack to ""The Witch"" one of my most favorite film scores in years. Overall, ""The Witch"" is not a standard horror film that will appeal to your average Fangoria gore-hound, but is more of an arthouse horror film for horror fans who appreciate a slow burn horror style of filmmaking that takes its time to build character and tension.",605,8,9,False

His film is meant to be both an homage and an ode to New England folktales and fairy tales centering around witchcraft and the supernatural. Most of the film's dialog and structure came from folktales from over two-hundred years ago, as stated in the film's end credits, and the look and feel of the film is remarkably 17th century, right down to the environments Eggers utilizes. If nothing else, ""The Witch"" is destined to be one of the most aesthetically refined and remarkable films of the year, let alone most beautifully shot horror film of the year. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke emphasizes the eeriness of the deep-wooded New England plantations, with precise focus on the location-swallowing fog and the overcast skies. As dreary and as miserable as the film looks, it's also immersive in the regard that it clearly plunges you into a different world; one you haven't been familiar with in horror films in quite sometime. Every year, we're almost guaranteed to get a Gothic-style, Victorian-era film that emphasizes lush scenery and immaculate cinematography, but rarely do the visual conventions of 17th century folk intersect with contemporary horror. In that respect, ""The Witch"" is a novel concept that sets itself up for noteworthiness on the basis of its locational possibilities alone. Before I get any more carried away than I already have, the plot must be introduced. Set in the aforementioned century, the story revolves around a traditionalist, god-fearing family led by William (Ralph Ineson), the intensely religious patriarch. His family consists of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), his eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), his son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and his young twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson). The family leaves their old land to start a new life on a farm, where Katherine gives birth to her fifth child, which is subsequently abducted by a witch before being sacrificed. This starts an unrelenting curse on this family that works to destroy it by going after its most innocent and helpless individuals, the children. Eventually, Caleb winds up becoming the witch's next victim, as a controlling and possessed spirit enters his body and begins to overtake him, all while the family is grieving over the loss of their newborn. Meanwhile, William and Katherine find themselves considering sending Thomasin into an arranged marriage now that she is becoming older, and seeing as she's proved herself in capable to take care of her younger siblings. As one can see, ""The Witch"" is very much a family drama, with psychological and supernatural horror ingredients injected into the film's premise to add the unsettling undertones. Unfortunately, ""The Witch"" gets its atmosphere down to a tee so well that it forgets to make a story that's as creepy as it sets itself up to be, let alone moving or worthwhile. Despite such wonderful, gloomy settings, the film never becomes very creepy or interesting enough for audiences to care. Everything, from the characters' personalities to their religious guidance, feels within arm's reach of us, and while the authentic, period-specific dialog is a commendable element, it only works to further distance people from the film's themes. This is truly a shame because I appreciate what ""The Witch"" sets up: a family rooted in deeply traditionalist, religious doctrine that is slowly finding out that Jesus, God, or any other kind of figure from their Bible cannot save them from the evil and sin that runs amok in the world. The idea that Jesus couldn't save himself is one that's hard enough to grasp, but what happens when one realizes that, because of that, he cannot save him or her either? William, played very well by Ineson, who goes for assertive and unnerving here, has the hardest time grappling with this idea as he watches his family crumble before his eyes. With that being said, watching ""The Witch"" can be a frustrating experience just because of how lifeless it often is. The level of character interest doesn't come anywhere close to the interest level of the film's setting, and as a result, there's little to connect to or embrace. It wasn't until about the hour mark that I truly felt conflicted as a viewer; here's a film with a biting, interesting premise and themes that's weighed down, not only by its esoteric approach, but also by its lack of legitimate creepiness until the last twenty minutes. ""The Witch"" doesn't flatline entirely like ""The Forest"" or other horror films of recent years, particularly ones neutered in content and approach to attract a younger crowd, but it doesn't titillate or excite like ""It Follows"" or ""The Sacrament,"" both films with similar premises, strong themes, but far more accessible characters and consistently interesting setups. Some will claim my soft dislike for ""The Witch"" comes from my lack of tolerance for slowburn horror, but consistent readers of my work know I hold slowburn horror near and dear to my heart and vastly prefer it over the tropes that have become commonplace in contemporary, American horror. The problem with ""The Witch,"" at the end of it all, isn't its pace, it's the paces it takes in the wrong direction.",893,3,11,False
imdb_the_witch_asda_man_20160501,The Witch,IMDb,asda-man,2016-05-01,10,A future horror classic,"This ain't no Hocus Pocus kids! Witches aren't usually the first port of call when coming up with horror film ideas. They work well with family film's like Nicholas Roeg's surreal adaptation of Roald Dhal's The Witches but can cackling old women with pointy hats and broomsticks scare grown adults? After seeing Robert Egger's striking debut, the answer would seem to be a resounding yes. The Witch is the best horror film since Kill List and is sure to become a future horror classic. I like to think of myself as a hardened horror movie nut but The Witch did actually manage to scare me, more so than the recent It Follows and The Babadook. It's a fairytale for adults and Robert Egger goes down alleys as dark as a film can get. Within the first five or ten minutes, I could tell that I'd be in for a stunning ride as we're treated to some seriously nightmarish imagery involving a naked old woman smothering herself in the blood of a baby, accompanied by a screeching score which is sure to give you the shivers. Terrifying sequences like this appear sporadically through the film so it never feels overdone, it just adds to the mounting tension in each scene until it explodes into the most wonderfully indulgent finale. A lot of films set in medieval times can be a bit trying. A Field in England and Black Death both felt like the setting let the film down by getting bogged down in confusing olde worlde Shakespearean-esque language. However, The Witch is never anything more than compelling throughout. The sole focus of the film is the family and all the parts are acted beautifully by the relatively unknown cast. The audience becomes incredibly involved and invested in the characters so you care about what's going to happen to them. There's a sense of dread in every scene but you're never quite sure about what's going to happen next which makes for unpredictable and absorbing viewing. I can't talk about The Witch without mentioning just how gorgeous the film looks. You could pretty much take any shot and hang it up for display in a gallery because it's just beautiful to look at. The eerie shots of the deep wood reminded me of Lars Von Trier's equally unsettling, Antichrist, however The Witch has a more fantastical quality to the images which adds to the Brothers Grimm fairytale kind of vibe. There isn't a second in the film's tight 90 minute running time where a shot doesn't ooze atmosphere. It's so refreshing to get a horror film which doesn't rely on a few seconds of gore to shock the audience, but actually takes it time to conjure up genuinely frightening images. There's stuff in this film which won't leave my head for a long time after viewing it. Equally as atmospheric as the imagery is the sound. I can't think of a more striking score or sound design since The Shining and it helps a lot to generate such an unsettling atmosphere. The exceedingly creepy dissonant violins and loud chants build scenes up to a shattering intensity where I found myself holding my breath. In fact, the whole film has such a strange and unnerving quality to it. It feels like you're watching something you shouldn't. It's no wonder that the film's even been endorsed by the Satanic Temple itself with the Temple's spokesperson calling it ""a trans-formative Satanic experience."" The Witch has to be my favourite film of the year and one of my favourite horror films full stop. I found it absolutely captivating and full of tension from beginning to end. It's pretty much as perfect as horror can get and exudes the quality of a classic chiller from the 60's. Robert Eggers is definitely going to be a director to look out for in the future. He's proved to critics that the horror genre is alive and well and can still genuinely scare the hell out of people. The Witch is a sensational experience for the eyes and ears, it's cinema at its finest. It is a delicious masterpiece of horror.",691,9,11,False

Things were very different back then. Religion had a much stronger presence in society. Along with that, you had rampant paranoia of witchcraft. These two historical facts play a big role in the core plot of The Witch. The plot focuses on a family that has just been banned from a village. With nowhere else to go, they travel outside of the village and try to make it on their own. They start growing their own harvest, each member of the family doing their part in the work. They rely heavily on their very intense Christian faith. Unfortunately for them, weird things start to happen.... starting with the children.

Paranoia plays a role here, so much so that it eventually leads everything to a breaking point. The acting in this film is some of the finest you'll see. The performances given scream talent, you can really tell that this cast was passionate about their roles. Anya Taylor-Joy blew me away as Thomasin, she really captured the emotion and depth necessary to play the role. Kate Dickie is also great here, she plays Katherine, the distraught mother. Dickie throws herself into this role and delivers a truly captivating performance. Lastly, is Ralph Ineson, who plays the extremely devout Christian father. I loved him in this role!

There is a naturalism to the acting and the setting that lends itself to this feeling like folktale handed down by the generations. The film's quite unnerving specifically because much of the details are left to the imagination. While the film is ultimately supernatural horror I found the film's treatment of a family dynamics getting frayed to more emotionally involve then the average horror film. And the father's pride getting the best of him really works as a religious message. In any case the visual lushness, especially the cinematography, of the film is rather hypnotic and the film has quiet power to it. Eggers is a really gifted director at invoking mood and atmosphere. This feels like a Puritan warning more than a modern horror film. Good film",179,6,6,False

After being apparently banished from their village, they begin their lives on a farm, where as mysterious things start to acre. The film introduces us to Anya Taylor-Joy as she gives a fine performance as the eldest daughter, Thomasin. It also stars Ralph Ineson who is terrific as the father, William, and Kate Dickie (whom you may recall from Game of Thrones) as the mother, Katherine. Except for maybe a couple things, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when viewing this. But right after doing just that, I will say that this is the scariest, most disturbing film I have ever seen; not in my life, but certainly this year. I will say, however, that there are in fact flaws. The first few minutes of the film are slow, yes, and the dialogue throughout his difficult to understand most of the time.

And, unlike so many others that I have seen lately, does not suffer from an abrupt or anticlimactic ending. The cons, unfortunately are too hard to ignore. First and foremost, the lighting is bad. Granted, there ought to be some darkness in a scary movie, but I had to turn the TV screen to almost full brightness, so to see much of what was happening. Another problem, was trying to figure out half of the spoken words. The place and time in history may call for ""old english"", but that plus the low volume of sound, make it hard to get what the characters are even saying. Especially the dad, who mumbles too much. I have quite good hearing, but could hardly understand a word that he said. Dare you turn up the volume, you'll be blasted by some other sound. You'd best turn on closed-captioning (if even available). Bottom line: if not for the problems just mentioned, I may have given the movie an 8/10. But a 9 or a 10: no way.

The story follows a devout family of seven who settle in the wilderness of Massachusetts just in time for things to fall apart. A series of unfortunate events ensue shortly after they take up residence, including the disappearance of the youngest family member (a baby boy), infighting among multiple family members and accusations of deceit and witchcraft. Of course, the latter is what drives the majority of the film, as the young children Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Granger and Lucas Dawson) accuse their eldest sister Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) of the act. Taylor-Joy dominates with her performance, which is not an easy feat considering the film is so depending on acting compared with other elements. One way 'Witch' succeeds is it is not overt or over the top in what it shows (at least, for the most part). Most of what gives the audience chills is not seen on screen, but it instead implied. Although, the use of devices such as the family's black billy goat is a creative way to send shivers down spines. Another aspect that works well is the gray scale filming style that's used. The coolness of the color used conveys the damp, dark atmosphere and harshness of the environment in an effective way. To be sure, there are a good deal of disturbing parts in 'Witch.' Some of the scenes are difficult to watch, but again, a lot more is hinted at than is actually shown. Near the film's finale, things unwind at a rapid rate, but this is the culmination of a slow build to the climax. 'The Witch' is not a masterpiece, nor is it one of the more memorable films of its kind to come out in the past few years. But it's a good example of how low-budget efforts can find an audience and rival their much more sophisticated, pricey peers.",346,1,2,False

This is a film that you'll either love it or hate it. I'm one of those people that loved this film. The film is creepy but not really scary. What's creepy about this film is the atmosphere and the musical score. What was scary about the film was the haunting imagery. The acting for the film is phenomenal everyone does a great job. When I was watching this film it felt like I was in the 1600's. Whoever did the set designs and the costumes all deserve an Oscar nomination. The directing for this film by Robert Eggers did a fantastic job for his directorial debut and I can't wait to see what he does next. There were a couple problems that I had with the film but they're only minor ones. The pacing of the film does have a couple slow parts and the language that the characters speak is hard to understand but later on in the film you start to have a better understanding of what they are saying. A lot of people didn't like the ending but I thought it was a good ending and I will be remembering that last shot for awhile. Overall if you're a fan of these art house horror films then this is for you. I think this is a film that will be analyzed in film schools and will come down to a horror classic.,246,6,6,False

Large studios have made it their business to corner the market on large tent-pole blockbusters, goofy comedies and stereotypical biographical dramas. There are only so many ways to make an audience laugh or manipulate them into tears; there are virtually unlimited ways to disturb them. For that reason horror lives largely in the realm of independent cinema where any young person with a dream and a vision can become the next Sam Raimi or Peter Jackson. Robert Eggers, director of The Witch seems to be aiming even higher. The Witch opens with William (Ineson) and his family leaving a Puritan plantation in New World, New England. Banished from the safety of the plantation, the family builds a humble cottage near the woods and struggle to make an ample harvest for the winter. Katherine (Dickie), William's wife fears death while the children begin to fear something much more nefarious hiding in the woods. This fear is planted when the youngest of the children, the infant Samuel is taken while in the care of the eldest daughter Thomasin (Taylor-Joy). After a series of incidences and misfortunes, the family begins to suspect Thomasin has dabbled in witchcraft. Robert Eggers drains the film of all of the predictable jump-scares and needing stock characters that populate most horror films, and instead loads his story with elaborate period detail and an overwhelming sense of dread. Each tableau masterfully evokes the stunning compositional techniques of Andrei Tarkovsky and to a lesser extent Carl Theodor Dreyer. His wide shots are alienating and contemplating while his closeups are symmetrical and solemn. Only the editing of Louise Ford and crew hints at a modern sensibility, everything else is remarkably old-school. Most audiences accustomed to the average schlock-horror may find this film far too pensive to endure. Especially given the fact everyone speaks appropriately for the time period. This is a shame too, because when this slow-boiling fright reaches its climax the pace only adds to the horror and shock. The constrained William and his family become victims of hysteria constantly looking for the grace of God when there is only deceit, hypocrisy, fear and the woods. Every single cast member is uncommonly committed to this film. Every once in a while there comes a film that graces us with one singularly brilliant performance. The Witch rewards us with three stars in the making; Anya Taylor-Joy, Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw who plays Thomasin's younger brother. The Witch joins the recent crop of decent horror films that seep into the mind, provide interesting characters and make monsters out of intricate details. The Conjuring (2013), The Babadook (2014), Oculus (2013) and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) all build their horror on a foundation of dread and suspense instead of butchery and chaos. This is not to say The Witch isn't bloody; it is. Yet the primary goal here is not to disgust but to disturb in a way that makes you leave the theater with an unnerving shiver. If you're feeling brave and are incensed by the eerie The Witch will certainly leave a strong impression.",529,1,2,False

imdb_the_witch_screen_blitz_20160618,The Witch,IMDb,Screen_Blitz,2016-06-18,7,Unnerving supernatural thriller with something more clever in mind,"For the past several decades, horror fans have grown fond of horror classics such as slashers, psychological thrillers, and supernatural thrillers dealing with characters batting against paranormal entities. Only a hand of full films of the genre are successful at balancing both cohesive character and plot development while carrying on an effective scare factor, even fewer achieve this feat as effective as this thriller directed by first-time filmmaker Robert Eggers. Rather than driving audiences into to straight-forward scare fest, this film centering on witchcraft as the primary antagonist, focuses on the eerie atmosphere and construction of the plot leading up to its shocking twist in the finale. The film is set during the 1630s, decades prior to the Salem Witch Trials, a period of prosecutions and executions of men and women who were accused of witchcraft. It follows William (played by Ralph Ineson) and Catherine (played by Kate Dickle), a devout Christian couple living in a isolated countryside of New England who value leading their five children into their following with God. When their infant son Samuel mysteriously vanishes and the crops began to deteriorate, the family begins to suspect one of them is cursed with witchcraft. As their fears and suspicions mount, the family find their lives terrorized by the demonic force. This film is not the horror thriller many people come to expect, and instead has something more unique in mind rather than blowing up in your face with jump scares and sight scares that's become a common tool in many other films of this category. Relying heavily on visceral storytelling and character development, the film conveys it's scares by building up suspense through hints without feeling the need to fully reveal the occurrences but the aftermath of how the family is affected by witchcraft. When it's all done, the most of the scares come not from what the viewers know but what they don't know, along with an eerie, hair-raising music score by Mark Korven and a few shots of grim imagery. For most of the time, it's quite effective. Now the film moves at a fairly slow pace which is enough to bore those who lack patience, but in the end what results is creepy and intensely thought- provoking experience filled with engrossing performances by Ralph Enison, Kate Dickie, and Anya Taylor-Joy who plays the eldest daughter. Even the younger children make advantage of their time to shine. As Christianity and witchcraft play prominent roles in the story, the film moves in profound directions that demands you for questions. The biggest mistake this film makes is assuming you have expert knowledge on witchcraft. Though the film succeeds on provoking thoughts in viewers, it occasionally falls victim into convoluted elements raft are either confusing or overly ambiguous, maybe both. There are plenty of scenes you leave scratching heads. At the same time, there is plenty of shock and creepiness, particularly the ending. The Witch is both a creepy and deeply visceral experience uprooted by an intelligent direction by Robert Eggers. Though it has some flaws, this film works at a fairly solid level and by the next decade, has a fair potential of going down as a cult classic. It is a unique experience that values more thought-provoking themes than typical jump scares, and by the end, it's a thriller that demands for your attention, even if it doesn't attract those looking for a straight forward scare fest.",571,1,2,False

When ""The lighthouse"" turned out to be a disappointment I began to doubt if I would still see ""The witch"". After all I am glad I have done it. ""The witch"", which has much in common with the Estonian film ""November"" (2017, Rainer Sarnet), is a more subdued and a better film than ""The lighthouse"". ""The witch"" has been carefully made. Much effort has been put in getting the period details right. One example of this is the use of antiquated language. This attention for period details has made ""The witch"" into a multi layered film. Layer 1 has to do with the extent to which the events are shocking for the viewer. Layer 2 concerns the extent to which the events are shocking to the main characters. With respect to layer 2 one has to consider that the main characters are deeply religious people for whom there is no real difference between the natural world and the supernatural world. The fear for the devil is for them very real. Because the devil can appear in various manifestations (including taking possession of a human being), this fear gives rise to a growing sense of distrust within the family. This fear and the resulting distrust in layer 2 makes the film more tense in layer 1. One can see the same effect in science fiction films in which an alien can take on a human form.

She is very fitting to this role as was the male lead. What I loved: Its portrayal of the 1600's puritanical thinking; strong ties to religion and therefore the devil, willingness to see the devil in anything that went wrong. The desperation of trying to hold on to your family and way of life. The performances of the actors were tremendous and very believable. The mother/ daughter relationship was well done - the daughter looking for her mother's acceptance and approval, the Mother always at odds with her. The younger siblings that were as annoying as today's younger siblings. The bond between the siblings. The setting, so lonely and isolated. The animal scenes, i don't want to spoil anything so i won't say more. The building desperation over grief, fear, threat of starvation. The ending - loved this. The twins were creepy! And I loved that I had no idea if there really was a witch, and if there was, who was it. What I didn't like: What season was it in New England that there are no leaves on the trees yet the weather seemed temperate? I'm thinking November, but they must have been some really hardy people. They never once seemed cold or were tending a fire. Whereas a movie like The Revenant literally made me feel cold throughout, this one seemed to be filmed during an Indian Summer. The music - I liked parts, but hated how the music would rise and get louder only to simply end in literally nothing significant. It would simply change to a black screen and then a new setting. While the music was exotic, it failed to match the tempo of the scenes.

The movie falls flat miserably and has very slow pacing with no pay- off. The acting was very mediocre at best. The only noteworthy performance was Anya Taylor-Joy, but obviously that wasn't enough. The actual writing had no ambition and I feel like the director took too many conservative options with the story just to be safe. This resulted in no significant set-pieces to happen to create tension or any kind of suspension or mystery. My biggest con is the non- existent soundtrack. A fundamental element of the horror genre is the gripping soundtrack but this movie just didn't have any. Because of this, many parts between segments were just stagnant. Cinematography was poor as well. They could've done a good job at capturing the wickedness of the forest, but they showed no ambition at doing that.

The film's most striking aspect is the attention to period detail; not only are the sets and costumes authentic, everyone also converses in Old English with appropriate vernacular, which helps to capture the flavour of the times. The film additionally benefits from a superb lead performance by Anya Taylor- Joy as the eldest daughter whose parents and siblings gradually begin to suspect of witchcraft as she undergoes adolescent changes. The less said about the actors playing her siblings the better though and the film's attempts at authenticity are sadly compromised by the washed- out visual approach with so many greys and blues favoured that the style calls attention to itself. The project also narrowly misses the mark for psychological horror. It is, after all, made quite clear that something sinister and malevolent is in the midst, giving little room to question whether it is all in their minds, onset by religious paranoia. That said, there is much to like in the notion that religious fanaticism further drives the family apart and causes them to distrust one another rather than bond together to combat the evil around them. The ending, if a tad overly literal, is highly memorable too and the film certain leaves much to ponder over.

It is nevertheless driven by a vision, it is pretty well made and puts on the radar some awesomely gifted child actors. Set in 17th century New England, it deploys the drama of a community confronted with a brave new world, left to the devices of their puritan roots to make sense of it, and eventually conquer it. Problem is, some collateral damage is unavoidable. Meet the Family, it does not have a name; they are an allegory of whatever can go wrong when America, land of the free, home of the brave, retracts into a witch hunt. McCarthy, neo-cons, whatever will happen next. Father (Ralph Ineson, whose gravelly voice is a third of the pleasure watching this movie), is banished from his community because he's too much of an integrist, even though he's a loving husband and father. He, his wife (Kate Dickie) and their five children are left to ""conquer this wilderness"" during an hostile season. Things quickly unravel from there, in a weird mix of The White Ribbon and Barry Lyndon, with some John Constable painting and a dash of Caravaggio being poured in the mix. Tomasin, the titular witch, anoints herself so to get rid of her younger siblings' annoyance and it uncoils a death trap fueled by ignorance, superstition and bigotry. Various animals intervene as God's will, or the Devil's. There is an evil hare, an even more evil raven, a hapless dog, and Black Phillip, a goat with a mellifluous voice, or so hear poor Tomasin, the unlikely heroin of the piece (Anya Taylor-Joy, wonderful). Then it goes like a country song, losing the last born, the harvest, the trust of your beloved ones, the horse, the wife, more children, your life. Everything is blamed on possibly evil, menstruating Tomasin, including the death of her brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw, nothing short of astonishing), who meets the witch, maybe, in a spooky scene with awful consequences. Everyone dies in retribution from animals associated with the Devil, but Mother, so mad by now she attempts at strangling Tomasin. ""You reek of Evil"", she yells at who was her beloved daughter a few days prior. One won't say how it ends.

Horror is a genre that has a defined scope which is governed by certain rules based on society's understanding of how ghosts/demons/spirits/'witches' etc function. While believers treat it as a social drama, others do so as a fantasy. So it is very important for the makers to have enough clarity on who their target audience are. In the recent times the makers have mostly catered to the latter audience dealing these stories as fantasies where these unnatural forces have the capability to control the technology (read 'Unfriended' or 'The Ring' series) which is fun to watch sometimes when done good. 'The Witch' goes back to the roots of orthodox methodology of film making in horror genre which is thus far so overdone that it is difficult to present in a way that attracts audience attention. Director Robert Eggers does overcome this challenge with a tight script, suitable cast and going to a period (mid 17th century) when witches and witch hunting is still a norm in that part of the world. Right from the first frame, it draws you into that period, into their family, into their beliefs, into their conflicts. Once the connect is established, it plays around with its smart twists, whodunit mystery and creepy background score where you are forced to invest your emotions but not sure where. William (Ralph Ineson) is a righteous believer in spreading the Holy word and that is the purpose of his arrival in America with the pilgrims. He feels cheated and confronts the society when he finds a changed agenda which gets him banished from the village along with his family comprising of his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), elder daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), young twins and a toddler. When they settle in a plain near the forest, things go south when their toddler disappears from the hands of Thomasin followed by Caleb's abduction in the forest. When Caleb dies, each family member starts blaming each other and that builds up a certain disgust and mistrust among themselves leading to painful confrontations. It takes a while to settle into and start understanding the period diaglogue, but that adds a little freshness into an otherwise simple story. There is also a huge variation in the character arcs and their performances - for example Kate Dickie plays a depressing character who goes all melodramatic, while Harvey Scrimshaw and Ralph Ineson gives a textbook stage performance. The twins are cute and high-spirited while Anya Taylor-Joy gives a rather subtle contemporary performance. Though the background score gets a little intrusive at the beginning, it settles down well and starts being effective and plays an important role along the way. The whodunit thread may not be a driving factor, but it adds to the mix of things. There could have been more scary thrills to give it a bit more mass appeal and some scenes could have been squeezed a bit more to generate the necessary edginess.

One illustration of this is that it does not rely on jump scares like most horror films. Instead it relies on an increasing sense of dread to create its horror, combined with strange and unsettling imagery. The film looks great. The colours are dull, and the New England forest setting is bleak and desolate. Perfect for a horror film set in the 15th century. The film's sound is also a standout, in particular the music. I don't know what the composition of instruments was, but it fitted the film perfectly. (One thing I found annoying however, was the dialogue, which in parts was difficult to understand.) Unfortunately the story lets The Witch down. Even though I didn't watch the trailer or know much about the film, I was unsurprised by what occurred in the film, from about 1/3 into it. I find predictable stories, especially in horror films, boring to watch. Fortunately the execution of the story in The Witch is great, but it doesn't quite mitigate this problem. In terms of casting, I think the stand-out here is Harvey Scrimshaw, who plays a young boy called Caleb. He has several key scenes and he nails every one of them. The other is Ralph Ineson as William, who seems a shoe-in for a Game of Thrones role at some point. Overall, I recommend this to any horror film fan -- you will definitely enjoy it.",257,1,3,False

Also notable is Kate Dickie as the mother and Harvey Scrimshaw as Thomasin's little brother Caleb. Cinematography is another strong point, the colour schemes are used extremely sparingly and skilfully, not quite being black and white but not dashed with so much colour as to lose the film's tone.

A couple of years fly by (faster than an old hag on a broom, might I add) and the film community ever increase their adoration for this horror. Did I miss something on my original viewing? Turns out, I did. A separatist family are banished over a religious dispute and encounter evil forces in the woods that seclude their New England farm. Surreal imagery provokes the inevitable question of ""is it real or imagined?"", and Eggers' directorial debut opens an ominous window into a period horror that transcends its own art form. Accompanied by Blaschke's stunning cinematography, Eggers directs you gently through this New England folk tale that, whilst not genuinely scary, provides a thick layer of uneasy atmosphere. The biggest complaint that is commonly thrown around is how ""boring"" it is. I implore you to grant this beauty another viewing. The pace, particularly during the first and third act, was consistent and well constructed. Balancing a thematic narrative that perhaps hosts too many metaphors, with illusory imagery that enhances the chilling tension that is substantially more effective thanks to Korven's score. No, I suspect the largest hurdle to bypass is the dialogue. Utilising a more unconventional 17th century dialect that, whilst feels freshly authentic, hinders character investment. It's difficult to quantify this choice as a detriment or a blessing. It does visualise the hysteria that culminates from devout Christians, and the fear of sin or corruption if individuals stray too far from the word of God. But due to Ineson's deep voice and Dickie's heavy accent, it is more often than not difficult to fully comprehend the dialogue. Fantastic performances though, but it just somewhat loses its edge with the dialect. I'm still indifferent about the ending, doesn't feel satisfying enough with its ambiguity. Still, I have to say that this is a gorgeous supernatural period drama that perhaps is too unconventional for most audiences.",333,1,3,False

THE WITCH is superbly crafted. Writer/director Robert Eggers has given us the perfect blend of psychological and supernatural thrill that will terrify you to your core. You'll never stop talking about THE WITCH long after it's done. A family in 1630s New England was banished from their settlement, and so the couple and their five children are out living in the wilderness, struggling to survive. Faith is the only thing that keeps them together. But their newborn son mysteriously vanishes and their crops fail, and the family begins to turn on one another, as they are torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession. What's brilliant about THE WITCH, on top of its excellent attempt on trying to be accurate to the period it portrays, is that it's very different from any of the other horror movies we get out there. No jump scares, no cheap gimmicks, no pointless plot. Everything is built up to lead you to creepy and unnerving discomfort and much of it also reminds me of dark paranoia thrillers of the '70s, where there are plenty of suspicions and blame to go around. Writer/director Robert Eggers successfully messes with his characters' and the audiences' minds. In addition to that, great choice on using the olde English mixed with excellent costume design and chilling cinematography, and young talent Anya Taylor-Joy is a revelation, THE WITCH gives a unique and refreshing take on this genre.

Without doubt, one of THE best opening scenes introducing the ""big bad"" (the Witch) and setting the tone for a horror movie. Hell, the movie is worth seeing just for the introduction the Witch gets. Now comes the part where the movie messes it up. It takes way too long showing an uninteresting puritan family's daily banter, which you most likely will have trouble understanding because thy speech is olde and rotten. Which means that you have to listen to them pray every time somebody drops the spoon or thinks they sinned or something (which is pretty much all the time). It added to the charm at first, but after half an hour, it got old and annoying. But the movie has another trick up its sleeves. The forest. That's right, the movie starts with the foreboding forest as the backdrop for the puritan family and presents it as a dark entity where only evil lives (why anyone would want to build a home next to it is a mystery, I sure wouldn't, I've seen Blair Witch :P). The scenes which are shot inside the forest are really well done with creepiness meter definitely on the edge constantly. Now comes the part where movie decides to ruin it all, again, but showing the typical moronic ending the movies with witches have. Manages to kill any suspense anything the viewer might have imagined, by showing a generic portrayal of witches. I know they were trying to be authentic to the beliefs of the people at the time, but they REALLY could've used something original and creepy. I am trying to avoid mentioning anything that would give the ending away, that's why this para is vague. I took of two points just cause of the last 10-15 mins which basically ruins any suspense or hope you had built up till then. BUT, is it a must watch movie? I didn't get scared, I only find psychological horror (Blair Witch) scary and this movie is not a psychological horror movie. In-fact, it shows you the monster in the beginning and avoids jump scares (there are only few and they are toned down as well) religiously. What this movie does well is the creepy atmosphere, which I haven't seen done since I saw Blair Witch as a kid one sunny afternoon. So yes, it's a movie you should definitely watch, despite my 6/10 rating. It would've been 8/10 with a better ending mimicking Blair Witch tone. Oh well.",417,1,3,False

The dialogue is in old English but still easy to follow, the actors do a wonderful job of delivering the lines and getting into character. I thought the direction was good but I did wish it was actually scary rather than, in my opinion, mostly just being creepy and atmospheric. I wanted something more terrifying or bizarre but in the end it was, bar a couple of occasions, quite restrained even when depicting mystical goings-on.

It is not that scary and there is no gore but the atmosphere he creates for the film is so tense that you keep thinking something macabre is going to happen. That, in my opinion, is an achievement. The meaning of Horror has changed over time. Earlier, we had films like Rosemary's Baby, Suspiria and The Shinning which relied heavily on the atmosphere, music, and story rather than monsters behind the closets. But nowadays, almost every single horror film relies on cheap tricks to scare the audience which may or may not be good depending on who you ask it to. These movies are so frantic and desperate to scare the audience that they don't focus on the other elements of the film. Sometimes, it may be effective but most of the time, it isn't. It has become old, cliched and predictable. The most important aspect of a film is storytelling, and if you fail at that, if you sacrifice that, then there's no point in making a film. Fortunately, we have seen some brave attempts in the last few years from some passionate filmmakers. The Babadook, it Follows, and, The Cabin in the Woods were amazing films that were not completely hollow and bereft of emotions. The Witch is another such gem from A24. Based on the Salem Witch trials which took place in the early 17th century, The Witch tells the story of a Puritan family. They (Husband, Wife and Five Children including an infant) are banished from their village over some disagreement with the community. They decide to live at the edge of the Woods thinking of it as a gift from the God, only to find themselves the target of an unnerving terror that lays in the woods. Soon, their infant disappears and things take an ugly turn. Once is starts terrorizing them, they can't make heads and tails of it. Weird things start happening in the midst of this paranoia, the family members turn on each other. Is it the work of a Witch? Are they being hunted by the Devil? Is the God punishing them? Reviewing a film like this is very difficult. Most of the people won't like it because it sells itself as horror and people are going to be disappointed as there isn't much horror in the film, at least not in the way people expect. That is the reason it is rated 6.8 on IMDb whereas the RottenTomatoes ratings are at 91%. People don't like slow movies (most of them). They expect something to happen every second so that they can keep devouring their popcorn. The Witch is completely opposite of that. It will be loved by those who see filmmaking as an expression of art and not just mere entertainment. The Witch excels at technical things and it gets most of the things right. The atmosphere in this film is creepy. I have never seen anything like that in any other horror film. The cinematography is gorgeous. Every frame has been crafted with great precision to aid in building the atmosphere. Some shots are long and the camera keeps zooming in, which kind of makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy. The camera does not make any sudden movements, it moves slowly, zooming in, zooming out, immersing you in this whole madness. The greyish color grading makes everything look lifeless and bleak, which adds to the horror element. The shots in the woods often include the actors at the bottom half so the trees look enormous, symbolizing how insignificant and helpless the family really is. The walks in the woods make up for some really tense moments. In one of the early shots, the camera shows the family sitting on the ground and praying. They think their prayers have been answered and they have found a perfect place to settle down. Then the camera keeps zooming in towards the woods before fading into black, almost soaking you in this inevitable dread and hysteria that follows. It's scenes like this that make The Witch an absolute joy to watch. Some choices are very interesting and thoughtful. During one of the scenes, we see Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy) and her brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshow) sitting near a pond. This scene serves two purposes. It shows that there is a pond/creek nearby where they get their water from. It also tells you more about the story. I can't spoil what happens during this scene but it is there for a reason. Also, look at the color grading and how grey things look. The night scenes are filmed with the minimal use of artificial lights. Most of the time, candles are used and the scenes are dimly lit. You can't help but think about something evil lurking in the dark. It is the fear of that unknown that scares you. It also results in some beautifully crafted shots such as the one attached below. the witch haunting But that being said, the most frightening character in The Witch is the atmosphere. Especially, The woods which is the resting place for the witches and other devilish things. That is what makes it relentlessly terrifying. Just take a look at the below pic for example. Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy) is stuck in the woods and it is starting to frighten her. The Cinematographer captures that feeling of dread by filming the huge trees in the background. He does not show the full view. Not knowing how high the trees go and how deep the woods are is what scares us. She looks helpless as everything seems much bigger than her. This whole atmospheric treatment results in the feeling of paranoia, which will linger with you till the end. It also does not shy away from filming some vomit-inducing scenes. The other important aspect of The Witch that helps build the atmosphere is the music. It perfectly complements the visuals and adds another layer of horror to it. We must thank Mark Korven for that. The music in the Witch is spooky and terrifying. I can't find the perfect words to describe it but it scared me more than the visuals. The music during the climax scene is so intense that I do not think I have a heart strong enough to download that soundtrack. The best way to describe it would be - Think of all the sounds from your scariest nightmares and put them all together in a single clip. It is dissonant and pretty unique. It will not give you jumpscares but is unsettling, nonetheless. You will keep thinking about it long after you've seen the film, that is if you are into music and know what good music means. It captures the whole essence of the film. Talking about acting, everyone is pretty solid but the child actors steal the show. They make the film what it is. half of the time I wanted to kick them because they irritated me beyond my tolerance limit and that is what the director was trying to do. Anya Taylor Joy is great as Thomasin. The father and mother are equally good. Harvey Scrimshaw has delivered a brilliant performance as Caleb, the son who is guilty about commiting a sin. His acting in this film blows everything Adam Sandler has ever done, away. How could he be so good? Eggers' direction is solid throughout the film. His storytelling abilities are amazing. He calls The Witch, A New England Folktale and that is what he turned it into. The tension and atmosphere in this film are what I expect from a horror film. It maintains the same atmosphere throughout the film and never lets go. It all builds up to an ending that hits you like a hammer to the face. I bet no one will be able to guess the ending. At first, I thought it was not that great. But the more I think about it, the more sense it makes. The reason I hold The Witch in such a high regard is because after watching the film, I had a feeling that I had consumed something evil and it was disturbing my inner-peace. Despite sharing my thoughts about the film, I am still not sure why I liked it so much that it may be one of my favourite horror films of all time. I guess, that's what good movies do to you. You don't know why you love them. One more thing that baffles me is how well researched the whole thing is. They even used the old English which is a bit difficult to grasp even with subtitles, especially for non-native speakers. But it results in a realistic film. The Witch is a film made with passion, by a passionate filmmaker, for passionate Cinephiles who don't mind an artistic horror film. It's not easy to watch and most of the people won't like it since they'll be expecting jump scares but if pulverizing babies is your thing then, do give it a try because it is a masterpiece of Horror filmmaking. I didn't like it as much in the first viewing but it kept making me think about it and now that I have seen it around 6 times, I can say that it is one of the best horror movies of the 21st century.I doubt anyone is going to make a horror film like that in the near future. P.S - If jump scares are your thing and you hate artistic films then leave it. It isn't scary.",1597,5,5,False

Unfortunately, any accusation of necromancy in this horror movie would fall directly on relatives. Excommunicated from their New England colony, William (Ralph Ineson), his wife (Kate Dickie), their eldest Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) and her siblings relocate to an isolated homestead adjacent to a forest. When the newborn and the eldest son disappear and the family's goat starts speaking to the children, rumours of sorcery start circulating with Thomasin as the prime suspect. An unnerving but authentic look at family life in 17th century, this multi-layered slow-burner embodies the dialect, dress and superstitions of the pious of those paranoid times. Meanwhile, the subversive script is supplemented by haunting imagery, restrained direction and notable performances.

Anya Taylor-Joy is mildly talented, and I've liked her in a couple of movies, but other movies have sucked. The dialog in this one is a petty stab at sounding eloquent but is mostly washed up with religious references. I recently watched the entire Deadwood series and thought the idea of having a period piece have good dialog was promising but was wrong with this one. Thy hath smited too much. The first scenes of the witch killing the baby also seemed promising with gore and effects, but it was a letdown when the entire movie revolved around the family arguing. All of the smaller children were pretty annoying, and so was the mother. The film claims to be derived from folklores, but none of it is based in reality, which is another misleading part about it.

Beautifully shot with coldness to the cinematography that perfectly suits the harrowing subject matter, this is a claustrophobic film in which feel isolated and cornered despite taking place in the middle of nature.

I'm saying this now, NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS FILM! In a world where we're used to films that rely heavily on jumpscares, The Witch goes on a more psychological route where it doesn't use any of the modern-day horror tricks like loud noises or jumpscares. This is what makes it very conflicting for the audience. For me, I found this technique highly effective. As a huge fan of the horror genre, I haven't seen a horror film which is so capable and insanely crafted like The Witch. This is the writer-director Robert Eggers' first feature film and I could tell he has a lot of talent. Each and every shot is handled so meticulously that I'm surprised that this is Eggers' first movie. Eggers really cares about this project. From the colour scheme, the costumes, the lighting to the atmosphere. All of this became so important to make the audience feel like they're in the 1630s. The attention to detail fully immersed me to this world. The decision to make everyone speak in the Old English language further enhanced the realism and brought you even closer to the characters and atmosphere. The acting by everyone involved was perfect. The way everyone spoke and emoted felt so real and so believable. Each performance was strong and felt like this was a real family. This aided me into believing all the events that take place over these 90 minutes. The script is thought-provoking and requires the audience's full attention to understand what's happening. A core element in a horror movie is the music. The Witch has such an uneasy and terrifying background score that adds to the atmosphere. I loved the way the makers portrayed the Witch in this film. Despite not showing the Witch much, you still sense its presence terrorising the family allowing the film to become more unsettling. The only problem I have with the film is its pacing. I felt it was a bit too slow. However, the film's harrowing atmosphere and characters made this feel like an experience like no other. As a debut, I have immense praise for Robert Eggers' take on the horror genre and look forward to his future projects. As mentioned before, The Witch isn't for everyone.

I thought that somewhere in the film they could have found some way to explain why they used two 'v's' to make the word 'witch.' The reason being that the word 'witch' came from Scandinavia in the form of the word ""vvitch"" meaning ""sorcerer"" (usually a male person as posed to a female person) which has a more powerful evil connotation that the commonly used western term 'witch.' The origins of the term are darker and imply greater evil than a 'witch.'

I am doing my review on account of the message board thread entitled A Slow Burn Into Nothingness. That could be considered good or bad depending on the interpreter. I called my review Blair Witch Prequel? because it could almost work as such. Two films of a different camera style ultimately achieving the same goal. Minimalist entertainment through symbols and suspense. The end result is also equivalent. you've heard the hype, now see the movie! Either you love it at the end or you feel duped. Both films have that kind of story that make you wonder whether what you are seeing has any supernatural elements or if the people are just going mad of their own accord. I find myself hard pressed to say whether or not I truly liked either film. Each one has a quality and level of talent that I respect. The Witch probably more so. However the buck stops with the expectation factor, and what the audience wants from a so called Horror Movie. Both of these films fall somewhat flat in the scares department. In terms of disturbing imagery The Witch does a great job, but somehow it lacks purpose. Even old ghost stories of the early 1900s seem to have some particular point to them. I'll admit, I felt in terms of what this film offers in terms of cinematography, style, music, and acting it is damn near perfect. What's missing is the ability to care for the characters. Even the annoying kids of The Blair Witch Project managed to make me worry about them. So I'm writing this in agreement to those who were disappointed by this movie, and at the same time defending it to those who outright hate it.

It creates and builds a creepy sense of foreboding and dread, and is precisely scary because it creates horror out of happenings that anyone could relate to: loneliness, isolation, male inadequacy, religious extremism, disintegrating family dynamics, mental illness, the death of a child. You don't need supernatural oogie boogies to make any of these things scary. Up to a certain point in the film, and despite the fact that we see the witch herself, the film allows its audience to interpret the story as not having a supernatural element at all, and instead be the physical manifestations of the internal mental anguish of its characters. But not content with that, the filmmakers have to make the Satanic spin literal, which immediately makes the film less scary, since I don't believe in God, Satan, Heaven, or Hell, so there's very little in any of that mumbo jumbo for me to be afraid of. What does scare me is religious fanaticism, and that's where I think this film is most effective. It shows what happens when a group of people who have nothing but faith on which to rely begin to lose that faith, and the lengths people will go to to explain random events as not being random at all but rather the conscious design of a higher being. The mother and father in this film would rather see their own children branded as witches and likely killed than admit that cruel things sometimes just happen, not because humans are being tested or humbled by an all-powerful God, but rather because sh*t just happens. When you've got parents who are willing to offer up their children for sacrifice to prove to themselves that their belief in a fairy tale is justified, you've got an allegory, whether intended by the filmmaker or not, for the kind of religious extremism plaguing the world now, let alone 400 years ago.

The simplicity in the nature of the plot is what I think keeps you intrigued and invested until the bitter end. Plus only clocking in at 90 minutes helps a ton to keep it from dragging on too long and it already has its slower sections in the first half of the film. The second half ramps up a bit making you second guess the family the witch stalks. Are they having delusions or is the witch really lurking in the shadowy forest surrounding the exiled puritan family's barn home? The way the film was shot too was once again gorgeous. Robert Eggers used the same cinematographer for this movie as he did in his other films like The Lighthouse, The Northman and of course Nosferatu. Lastly the acting I thought was pretty solid too from game of thrones veterans like Ralph Ineson and a young Anya Taylor Joy. I guess if I had to nit pick I'd say that the first half of the movie felt a little too bland and uninteresting in some parts until they started digging into the whole witchery conspiracy at hand when animals and their family members begin to start behaving erratically.

When horrors deal with religion though, they usually just use it as an excuse to make horned demons appear pretty much everywhere but The Witch is extremely different: we barely see any monster, violence is kept at a minimum and the terror usually comes in form of a terrible sense of unease. When this New England family is banished and forced to live in exile amidst the woods, we immediately see that their journey is doomed. The younger child, Samuel, disappears and it doesn't take long before each family member starts blaming each other until accusations of witchcraft and demonic possession arise. Not too differently from Carpenter's The Thing, The Witch focuses on the personal relationship between the cast members and their feeling of un trust that the father tries to sedate through prayers and sermons. The Witch rarely gives some answers, it keeps the viewer constantly wondering why some things happen, whether someone in the family has signed a path with the Devil or some evil force has simply decided to put its hands on the Abbot family. The more we watch, the more we're inclined to think someone in particular attracted the Witch of the Woods and we're left wondering until the bodies start piling up. The Witch isn't a movie for everyone though: the slow pace doesn't always help building up the suspense and more in general the screenplay asks the viewers to be patient and wait for the final climax.

With its linguistic and scenographic accuracy, the movie transports you passionately back to 1630s New England and into a family of early settlers, whose everyday life is harsh and pious to the extreme. When their newborn son suddenly disappears in broad daylight, the oldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) watches her family members slowly disintegrate into grief, guilt, devoutness and distrustfulness. The film bases its existence on how people in this time and place had nowhere to turn to for answers except inwards or to religion. Their inability to understand their own and each others' situation and emotional life is the implicit horror here, even if the film's ensuing delve into some very prevailing superstitions from the era is the explicit theme for Eggers' foray into the horror genre. Perhaps it was a little misleading to market the film as a more standard horror flick, even if it certainly helped the sales. Because this is a slow-burning tale which cares less about genre-expectations than about settler era ghost stories and the circumstances that made them necessary or at least relevant at the time.

Then the facts are precipitated using the trigger of the lack of sacred rituals which reveals the potential eternal damnation.

With the tradition of the new cinema where everything interesting happens in the final ten minutes (as in Sinister, Paranormal Activity and many others) we find everything fantastic and terrible presented in a suggestive and then majestic way. In this particular case it is logical to accept the pattern of a pact with the Devil since otherwise life would have been hell. It is the paradox of the film: changing one hell for another.

Since then, I've been eager to check out his other work. Recently, this included 2016's, *The Witch*. In 1630s New England, a family is thrown out of a local plantation because of the father's vocal opinions on religion not jiving with the established Church. He's warned to stop abusing everyone, refuses, and has to leave. The family then moves to an uninhabited plot of land by a creepy wood, said to be haunted by a witch. The going is hard, their crops are failing, and life is difficult. Yet pride will not let them (especially the father, William) return to the plantation. Then their newborn vanishes. More things start going wrong. Eventually, the family begins suspecting supernatural involvement, with blame beginning to fall on their teenage daughter, Thomasin. As one expects in 1600s New England, she gets accused of witchcraft, and things go from bad to worse. Eggers is an absolute master of time and place with his films, which absolutely drip with atmosphere. The setting is dreary, harsh, and oppressively religious. The dialogue is almost too authentic, leaning so heavily into Middle English some casual viewers might be distracted (the historical note that follows mentions many of the bits of dialogue are taken from historical documents, along with many of the events of the film). Of course, all of this only goes to enhance the atmosphere, which permeats every scene. In fact, I would describe *The Witch* as more of an art film, one that is more a matter of setting than of a plot or character-driven tale. In that sense, it's a very slow burn, albeit one where rising dread creeps in with each passing scene. Speaking of which, the portrayal of the supernatural is fantastically creepy and inexplicable, feeling very much like something believable within the historical context. Overall, I'd call it a solid, fascinating watch that seems more an experience than a typical movie.",332,0,0,False

This is a film that relies on slow, slow tension, to the point it could probably be a thriller if it weren't for the horrific imagery. It's relatively sparse on jump scares (which, in my opinion, makes them more effective), there's no over-the-top gore (once again, used sparsely and mainly offscreen, therefore more effective), and the movie has one element that will either endear viewers or turn them away: period-accurate English. Seriously, unless you're a fan of Nathaniel Hawthorne novels and can understand the kind of English the pilgrims spoke, it might be best you watch this movie with subtitles. Nonetheless, this is a really good movie. The acting is incredibly spot-on, even that of the young children. Anya Taylor-Joy is a standout as she's arguably caught in the center of most of the story's conflicts. Each actor makes it believable that they are suffering through the hardness of the undiscovered American wilderness made worse by their own paranoias. The costumes are spot-on, the movie's mythology pays a ton of respect to real-world witch lore, and I recently learned that the movie was filmed using only natural lighting, which certainly adds to the feeling that we're enduring the family's hardships alongside them. And the entire movie absolutely drips with tension as we're left wondering how long it will take for everything to fall apart and what will be the main cause of everything: either the family's world or the family themselves. Blend this in with some truly disturbing imagery (occasionally made laughable by the complex English) and you've got yourself quite an unconventional horror flick.

While true to the hysterics of the time over anything the recent English immigrants could not understand and therefore labeled as evil, (the dense woods, disobedient women, breasts, etc.) artistically this film is a mess. Let's start with the overuse of blank screens for long seconds (minutes?) of time. This may have been intended to build suspense, especially with the use of fraught vocal music in the soundtrack, but it is used far too often, and the screen is kept blank too long, followed by- nothing! Apparently in this film, it's the equivalent of dropping a screen on stage while the actors change places or costumes. It could have been employed once or twice to great effect if the blank screen didn't last as long, (the viewer on my left mumbled ""WTF?!"" at the second or third use of this) and if it was followed by a surprise or shock to the viewer. Then there's the dialogue: approximately 25% of it, especially early in the film, is indecipherable and at different volumes. The elder son, Caleb, has a different (Cockney) accent than the rest of the family. OK, the Puritans were creepy in their singular devotion to The Bible, and living in and adapting to the apparently always dreary New England was a bit much for their imaginations. But why must women be portrayed always as The Shrew, The Temptress, or the Agent of Satan? I give this film 2 stars for its novel attempt to depict the life of early Puritan settlers in their uneducated, superstitious and hysterical ways.

This was perhaps due to the language. It takes a while to adjust. As Robert Eggers films go, this is probably closer to the Northman, than to the Lighthouse or Nosferatu. There's a definite folk horror theme similar to Ben Wheatley or even Michael Reeves' Witchfinder General (one of the so-called ""Unholy Trinity"" of folk horror. There's also an Inside No. 9 episode that reminds me of the Witch. This film appeared to influence both The Ritual, Midsommer and Shane Meadow's series, the Gallows Pole. If anything, this is an indication of the heath of this particular subgengre There's a real sense of religiously inspired puritanical paranoia in this film, something that has shaped the history of the United States up to the present day. As folk horror is a subgengre which revolves around the hidden horror buried in the soil - in the priordinal forgotten memory of a community - it's reasonable for a viewer to conclude that this film is exploring the depth of the American unconscious: the puritanical fervour and forbidden desires which shaped the contradictory America of both hardcore porn and evangelical Christianity (of course, the root of ""America"" lay much deeper and it's important to remember that these colonialists were adventurers on stolen land).

The start of the film sets the tone and plot very well: we see early American Puritan settlers and a man on trial who gets banished, followed by the man and his family living on a farm in the woods. The film looks as if a slight grey filter has been applied over it, since all the colours look muted. The lone farm and the family's fear of wolves and the woods creates a sense of loneliness, and the film has a lot of long, lingering shots that help drive home the creepiness. The use of Middle English as in the time of Shakespeare served great to set the time of the film, what with the people in those days being more religious and superstitious than today (generally). The following describes the flow of the film, which some may consider a spoiler, but doesn't outright state the events that happen. Proceed at your own volition. The film kicks off its plot and tone very well and quickly. It meanders a bit in the middle, but not uselessly so, as each scene has a clear purpose, leading up to the higher points later in the film. The symbolism and reveals in the film are very transparent, with perhaps one exception. The finale is sort of two-part, which is why I feel this film isn't as strong as it could've been. The first part is very strong and tragic, the second part was sort of foreshadowed, but not a logical conclusion in any sense--it was antithesis to the way the character was presented all the rest of the film, in my opinion. In the end, I enjoyed the film for its atmosphere, and would recommend it to people who enjoy films for that reason, enjoy a bit of horror, and like (or don't mind) historical settings.

It was a feeling that I rarely feel after watching a film. The feeling that this movie created in my stomach was dread. Is this movie scary? I think so. But it wasn't the actual witch that had me sweating throughout the the film, rather, it was the psychological torment that the main characters were going through during the events of the movie. Seeing each character break down into madness was haunting, and was only complimented by the amazing soundtrack that added an extra layer of tension to each scene. The characters were extremely well written, each with their own motivations, fears, and flaws. The acting in this movie is fantastic, and never at any point did I not believe any of the characters, they were all portrayed very well, and even the child actors did a pretty good job. The whole film takes place around one small house, which creates a feeling of isolation and hopelessness, which is complimented by the film's ugly, grey color palette and dark lighting. Disturbing things happen throughout the film, but despite this, the film never relied on cheap gore to shock audiences, but rather sets up a disturbing canvas, and asks the viewer to paint the rest of the picture. It leaves the most disturbing moments up to interpretation, and as a result, made them more impactful to the audience. This psychological build up continues to grow until the very end, at which point the film just pours out all of the madness that it's built up for the audience to witness. I wouldn't classify The Witch as a horror, but rather, a dark drama with disturbing elements of horror sprinkled in. As a movie, I'd rate The Witch 10/10.",301,3,2,False

Things happen to the characters and they react to them. Or sometimes characters will make very out of character decisions to create drama. The lighthouse for me worked better in this way because the characters were more engaging, we spent more time with the lead whereas Anya Taylor Joy's ""Tomasin"" doesn't have enough of a focus in my opinion. It's hard to criticise this movie because all my complaints with the film are things that were done very intentionally and might work better for other people or if I rewatched it.

It follows an American Puritan family in the 1630s living in exile at the edge of a nearby forest as they are tormented by hostile otherworldly forces. Firstly, the acting. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance as Thomasin, eldest daughter of the family, is wonderfully intense and sincere in displaying the hardships of the life of a young Puritan girl, especially one whose role in the family is so thankless and ignored. Throughout the film, she tries to win her mother's approval and dutifully support her family, but is instead repeatedly used as a scapegoat for much of the family's woes. Ralph Ineson plays gruff but well-meaning father William, and Kate Dickie plays distant mother Katherine. Every character feels real, no doubt helped by the authentic dialogue accurate to the time period, which must have been difficult to remember and was painstakingly researched by the production team. Secondly, the atmosphere. The whole film has a constant air of tragedy and sadness, and even in scenes where there is nothing overtly scary happening, the viewer will be on the edge of their seat, expecting something horrible to happen, but no. The tension builds and builds. Over the course of the film, the bonds between the family members are pushed to the limit as they grow increasingly desperate and some become hostile to one another, charging each scene with a sense of profound unease, so you're never certain of what will happen next. That is the masterstroke of the film, the continual ""slow-burn"" tension and uncertainty that will keep audiences disoriented and searching for concrete answers. The film, aside from being a horror film focused largely on exploiting tension and unsettling imagery, is also an excellent demonstration of how harsh the average Puritan family's life was at the time, out in the wilderness without support, and how quickly a family can succumb to paranoia thanks to stress and tragedy. Thanks to the mixture of more mundane family drama and gripping terror, there are many ways to interpret the film's events, and I am glad that the film allows for that flexibility since I feel that horror, with its basis in creating fear, should let audiences draw on their own fears and experiences while watching. In conclusion, the film is an excellent ""slow-burn"" horror film, with masterful performances, a great mood and atmosphere, and the benefit of being vague enough to allow for multiple interpretations.

I liked the set up and the first half. We are presented with a small handful of intelligent and sympathetic characters and there is a clear sense of where (but not what) the threat is. Then just past the half way mark, the scenes get progressively silly and derivative of better horror movies. You feel the irony of a witchcraft movie that has been possessed and lost its soul and direction. The decision to use strong period dialect is simultaneously frustrating and intriguing. It commands the audience to be intelligent listeners but there are times when sentences get muddled underneath the heavy British accents. The theme of fearing abandonment by god (or possession by darkness,) is prevalent as the story gets underway. At first it feels like a historically accurate motive for character vulnerability, but instead it becomes a device for hokey paranoia as our characters start pointing fingers and accusing each other of witchcraft. The dramatic momentum that slowly accumulates in the first hour comes undone in the last half hour. The Witch starts as a story about characters but regretfully caves in and conforms to the horror genre by summoning gimmicks like the possessed animal that turns on its master. Once the chaos starts to pick up you get the feeling that a lame ending is inevitable. The last scene of a movie is visually quite strong without being showy, but the punchline feels meaningless beyond saying that darkness prevails; again very generic for a horror film. Strong acting and eerie scenery are the additional highlights, but the finished product is neither scary nor memorable.",296,13,14,False

imdb_the_witch_kannibalcorpsegrinder_20220904,The Witch,IMDb,kannibalcorpsegrinder,2022-09-04,7,Enjoyable enough but not as great as most say it is,"Banished into the wilderness from their homestead, a Puritan family living in a remote cottage are shocked when their baby's disappearance leads to further misfortune as the paranoia that fuels their lives are soon found to be caused by a malicious figure targeting them, and must find a way of stopping it. There was quite a lot to like with this one. Among the more prominent aspects here is the strong storyline that manages to offer up a dark and chilling atmosphere throughout here. Not only is the period setting put to splendid use by getting people out into the wilderness full of superstition and ignorance, but the idea of the family on their own in this situation offers quite a lot to really enjoy. Even though their child's disappearance is a grave incident that rightfully and emphatically disrupts their lives, that we still see them carrying on with setting traps, harvesting their crops, and going about their lives with a sense of distrust and disbelief in religion that wholly affects them. That manages to work its way quite nicely through the film with the tragedies that are shown to occur here. From the seemingly innocent, including the misadventures while hunting to the strange animal attacks at their house and finally the strange disappearances that soon befall them, this starts setting an ominous tone of something playing games with them in the woods surrounding the family. As this goes on and the incidents start to point towards the daughter being the culprit, the feverish intensity that brings upon the graphic action in the finale as everything gets twisted around into a rather shocking and conceptually terrifying conclusion. Overall, these factors are enough to make this one quite enjoyable There are some generally detrimental factors that hold this one down though. The biggest issue affecting this one is the highly underwhelming tempo and pace that this plays at. There's not much in the way of energy or momentum gathered in this one, which is by design due to the period setting but also the lethargic and sluggish way this carries on once the family's started to be affected. The lack of action and main focus on the family trying to put the stress of the situation onto something other than each other features rather uninteresting elements including their useless quarrels or inability to see past their religious fervor to the plain truth. This also points to the other big factor in the film which is the highly obvious lack of physical presence by the witch throughout here. Rather than getting plenty of screentime casting spells or putting in an appearance to set things in motion, this one only has two brief sequences with the titular being until the final minutes and neither of them is genuinely scary or tense. That ends up leaving this one with an inordinately long time with nothing much happening beyond the family strife and paranoia-filled delusions at the center of the storyline and can lead to a rather full experience. These factors are what hold this one down the most overall. Rated R: Language, Violence, Full Nudity, and violence-against-children.",523,0,0,False

imdb_the_witch_aminre4_20160313,The Witch,IMDb,aminre4,2016-03-13,1,Over rated low budget so called HORRO film.,"I would be lying if I said this movie was great. I went to watch it yesterday in the cinema and was really looking forward to it with very very high expectations after seeing the trailer and the high ratings of IMDb and RottenTomatoes. The title simply misrepresents the movie. I was extremely disappointed at the end of the film simply because it didn't deliver what it was supposed to deliver, HORROR. I only saw the WITCH on two or three occasions throughout the film and didn't feel any witchcraft or dark magic whatsoever. Over all, without going into much details, it felt that the film was all over the place and going in many different directions that did not lead to nowhere. The script in my opinion was not the right one for this movie, it just builds up the suspense and makes one feel hyper endlessly without any jump scares and it lacked the element of surprise which you would expect in a horror film. The storyline misleads the audience to something unfinished and the chain of events do not make sense at all. I did not understand what happened to the two children and why they were screaming and when they were bewitched and by who. Also, I did not quite get what the goat's or the rabbit's role in the film, they just appear and disappear and the goat stood once which I was expecting it at that moment to transform to the real witch so we get to hear what she has to say, but unfortunately, it didn't happen and it only attacked the man and killed him, very simple and straightforward. Any goat can attack and kill a man you don't need to go to the cinema to watch it lol. Finally, I think the people who over rated this film should review their taste or at least be truthful what they saw. There was nothing to like about this film unfortunately and it is just a waste of time I must say. I know what a horror film should look and sound like, and if this film is rated 7.4/10 on IMDb, and Silent Hill is rated 6.6/10, then you must know that there is a clear issue in this regard and it makes you ask the question, who is really managing the ratings and how do they do it?

Ralph Ineson steals the show here as William, a devout Christian father who takes his family out of the plantation they are living in after a disagreement he has on religious matters with the plantation leaders. They set their markers down in the New England wilderness, and begin to farm. Strange and devastating things begin to occur before long. The baby Samuel vanishes while outside with the eldest daughter Thomasin (brilliant performance by Anya Taylor-Joy) and the crops fail. Facing starvation, the family soon begins to turn on each other, as Puritan fears and paranoia suffocate the household. ""The Witch"" offers a subtle type of horror in an original and unique setting. The film plays like you are watching a heavy drama on stage (""The Crucible"", perhaps?) and yet the horror elements just keep building and building, accompanied by a strange score, and serve to rack up the tension, and your nerves, before reaching its crescendo in the final scene.

The acting is great. The movie was incredibly boring for what we were planning on seeing. It is being mis-marketed as some incredibly frightening horror film, but it is a snoozefest if you go in expecting this to be scary.

When I first saw a trailer for The Witch it seemed like the perfect horror movie for me. The time period and setting are even enough to bring chills just thinking about it but I am sad to say that these are probably among the best features of this movie. The Witch fails in so many ways that I am having trouble remembering the few things in which it succeeds, and those few things are not nearly enough to save this disaster. I don't want to make this review a list of things I hated about the movie followed by praise for Anya Taylor-Joy so I will begin with her performance. Really the only highlight of the movie, Anya Taylor-Joy brought the fear out of not only the terrible things happening, but also the feeling of being trapped as she was. Her character was the only one who I really felt for through the movie as all of the other characters were dis likable for the most part. I guess I will start with the story and whatnot since that is probably my biggest complaint. The story goes nowhere. The plot seems to be a series of boring farm chores and deep prayer scattered with a few moments of fear. There was no sort of effort to make the story circular, or to really even bring many of the things brought up in the beginning to a satisfying conclusion. The old saying of ""Don't show a gun in the first act if you aren't going to use it in the third"" is disturbingly broken here. The worst part about the story is that it is not even innovative. The normal worn out horror genre format is here with the first hour of the movie being a crawl with a brief moment is horror splashed in. Then the last half hour aims to shock and disturb leaving the last 15 minutes for the real scares. The Witch does all of this poorly as none of the moments of tension hit nearly as hard as they think and the overall payoff is not clever or satisfying. The direction of the movie is filled with close up reaction shots that most of the time amount to nothing. The camera will show a character horrified and then when the viewer finally gets to see what is so interesting it always ends up disappointing. There were absolutely no shots in this movie that were really impressive. The look of the movie actually was also impressive, but when juxtaposed with basic camera placement and movement it just offsets each other. Good horror movies are a dime a dozen these days, but The Witch seemed like it had a good understanding of how to make a good one. Again the time period and subject are a wealth of entertainment for this genre but the makers of this movie got lost somewhere along the way. I would not recommend this to anyone other than people who really like horror/thriller movies just to let them have an opinion. In my opinion this one is an easy pass.",533,0,3,False

Instead, we've got something much deeper - more of a character study of a DEEPLY religious family in Puritan times, complete with period-appropriate speech, cast out of their community due to a religious dispute. They leave the settlement and make their own home a few days' walk away at a home and farm they build by the edge of a forest, including adding a newborn baby boy to the family. What follows next is a genuinely gripping journey as we watch this family struggle with an apparently failing farm plagued with food rot - leading to a lack of food - and an apparently failing belief in god - leading to/caused by them being plagued by a local witch. Or are they? Is it all just some kind of hallucinatory experience caused by eating rotten produce? The movie is never truly clear on what the family actually experiences. Maybe they ARE just delirious, maybe their goat IS just a temperamental a-hole rather than the devil incarnate. Either way, the cast are all fantastic, the score is brilliant and a little off-key and off-kilter, the cinematography is intentionally drab and feels washed out which sets the tone perfectly.

imdb_the_witch_fernandoschiavi_20220409,The Witch,IMDb,fernandoschiavi,2022-04-09,7,NULL,"The supernatural is joined to a genuine fear, victim of prejudice and ignorance, motivated by social and religious issues that could be in vogue at the time portrayed as today Bringing several dialogues that, according to screenwriter and director Robert Eggers, were transcribed from real accounts recorded in 17th century New England, the film follows a family that, right at the beginning of the projection, is expelled from the small village they inhabit for reasons which are not entirely clear, but which seem to be a response to Patriarch William (Ineson)'s extreme interpretation of the Bible and of the Christian faith itself. Alongside his wife Katherine (Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Taylor-Joy), pre-teen Caleb (Scrimshaw) and three young children, the guy starts to occupy a cabin located on the edge of a forest. However, isolation and the failure of crops begin to wear out the family through hunger and a tragedy that ends up compromising everyone's psychological balance once and for all. Little by little, the young Thomasin starts to be harassed by her own relatives when she becomes a suspect of witchcraft. The plastically studied photography by Jarin Blaschke collaborates to create this climate of oppression and constant fear, efficient in putting the public before the dilemmas faced by the protagonists of a plot passed centuries ago as if they were contemporary experiences. Identification is immediate, and this only serves to increase the degree of horror experienced on both sides of the screen. The father is the brute force, but also the charitable look. The mother is all tension, guilt and accusations. The eldest daughter tries to keep her sanity, while the boy struggles to show maturity, even though his little age contradicts him. The couple of younger children look as angelic as they are demonic - it's all a matter of point of view - while the baby... well, that one has little to tell us. And not because I don't know how - after all, certain looks speak more than a thousand words - but simply because I don't have the time to do so. In the midst of an innocent prank, he disappears without a trace, in an inexplicable way. Suspicion immediately falls on the firstborn, responsible for taking care of him. The family is divided, some believing her innocence, others accusing her of witchcraft and worse curses. But would she be here in the cabin where the origin of evil lives, or deep in the woods beside the small ranch? The Witch is a horror film less concerned with scares than with the idea of exploring the darkness of the individuals who inhabit its world. For most of the projection, the genre-defining ""terror"" emerges not in the form of evil spirits, brain-eating zombies, or even literal witches, but from within your characters, manifesting in the form of stupidity, superstitions, and religious fundamentalism. The Witch is located in the period of colonization of the USA, showing the trajectory of a family of extremely religious immigrants who are expelled from their colony, being forced to live with the still unknown new world. Thus, the terror in The Witch is based on two factors, the fear of the unknown, the dread of this new land, represented by the forest next to the family's new home; in addition to the guilt arising from religious fundamentalism, in which these characters believe they are doomed to sin and tempted at all times by evil. These two psychological factors and as if they left that family susceptible to the supernatural, as if fear and guilt were the gateway to the macabre, or that these signs of another world are the result of a blinding fear, which does not allow one to perceive reality. And so, the film tries to place the spectator on the same level as the figures in its narrative, betting on a terror that is much more sensitive than visible. Eggers is just one of several first-time directors who form a kind of newly formed avant-garde in the independent horror movie market, which is increasingly distancing itself from Hollywood. This rupture is the result of a repetitive and excessive use of cinematic artifices in the commercial terrors of the big studios. Despite being efficient, techniques such as jump scare, those sudden changes in the image or in the soundtrack, are used tirelessly, often in a single film, and ended up saturating the Hollywood model of horror. Instead of trying to scare the audience in each sequence of scenes, the alternative productions aim precisely at creating a gradual tension that only dissolves at the climax of the film. These productions do not focus on physically startling the audience, but on psychologically involving them in their disturbing plots. For this, they also get rid of other gender stereotypes. The gratuitous sex and violence scenes, for example, which have always been characteristic aspects of horror and are nothing more than tools to attract the public's attention, are almost absent in this type of production. This is not to say that these films are necessarily less bloody and sexual, but rather the opposite: the objective use of these types of scenes makes them more intense and less banal, appearing as a repression rather than an expression of sexuality. Here, the narrative is more concerned with subtlety than overt fear. Much of this effect of constant tension is built on by Mark Korven's efficient score, which employs dissonant vocals and sounds that, created essentially by string instruments, keep the viewer in a constant tension that suggests a threat whose nature we cannot identify, but which it certainly seems to have its origins in the forest that surrounds the characters and which, photographed by Jarin Blaschke as a gigantic and dark wall, creates a claustrophobic tone even when the scenes take place outside the cabin. In addition, the high contrast presents in the night scenes, which envelops everyone in a seemingly impenetrable dark cloak, not only maintains the suffocating tone but subtly points to the existence of an invisible evil that can invade the environment at any moment. But the discomfort aroused by The Witch is also the result of the realistic way, anchored in a detailed production design, with which the family's difficulties to simply survive in the early 17th century is portrayed: a daily life of exhausting manual work, zero hygiene and very few resources in case of illness - and, no wonder, the filmmakers lead the viewer to see everything through a gray, desaturated and sad palette. In addition, the sound design is clever in using noise and whispers as a recurring source of uncertainty and insecurities - from the murmurs coming from the forest to the simple (but palpable) fragility of children who overhear conversations between their parents and sense the gravity of what is being said. Even without being able yet to understand what the discussion involves. Betting on a funereal setting, with a color palette that gives the feeling of something rotten in the old wood, in the muddy floor and in the actors themselves, ""The Witch"" is an atmosphere film, with its fear being built by suggestions and symbolism, walking a fine line between the sacred and the profane, and indicating with each new scene that something very wrong - and bad - is about to happen. From the goats on the farm, to the wild nature of the twins, to the very look of young Anya Taylor-Joy, with hair bordering on white and wide eyes that make her perfect for horror movies. Eggers still applies several techniques that immerse you even more, positioning the camera so that we can't see the full extent of long shots, alternating the use of natural and artificial lights - photographer Jarin Blaschke should have been nominated for an Oscar - and counting on a dissonant and ear-scratching soundtrack with classic compositions. In addition, from the costumes to the production design, it's as if we were transported to that place and we were without action in front of everything and without knowing exactly what the director's true intentions were, which makes the experience even more suffocating. And in doing so, the film turns the gradual collapse of that family into the center of its horror. William, Thomasin and the others know that emotional bonds are breaking down and that deep psychological wounds are being opened, but they lack the intellectual, cultural and emotional sophistication to understand exactly how to prevent this from happening. Complicating this, of course, is Thomasin's sexual awakening and physical transformations - a symbolic device as classic in horror as, say, a vampire or... a witch. Constantly, in works of this genre, female maturation is seen as the initiator of supernatural events, from Carrie the Possessed, through The Panther's Mark, Hell Girl and The Experience - and, in The Witch, Thomasin ends up being blamed and demonized simply for develop, since much of the aggressiveness with which she is treated is a direct result of the discomfort it causes in the men of the family and, indirectly, in her mother. But if ""The Witch"" has bothered many for its religious themes - and it should, then, in a way, all young Thomasin wants is freedom to pursue the pleasures of life that we all like to think we're entitled to, and what constrains is the patriarchal and archaic way in which the religious family lives - it was the lack of jumps cares that had unsuspecting viewers slipping into an art movie as they waited for the first of many sequels. But if the boring (in the best sense) hour and a half of the movie wears you out early, pay attention to the details, the suggestions, the looks, the movements of each creature on screen. The efforts gathered here reveal a refined work, which plays with the act of scaring responsibly, with parsimony and great care, without revealing anything beyond the account and measuring with wisdom each new revelation. The supernatural is joined to a genuine fear, victim of prejudice and ignorance, motivated by social and religious issues that could be in vogue at the time portrayed as today.",1690,0,3,False

Similar to 2014's It Follows, it is a watchable horror that does not rely on cheap thrills, jump scare scenes nor gore. Rather, the film relies on masterful filmmaking and acting to create this dark and deeply unsettling vibe. This compliments its excellent, non-conformist storyline that features a terrorizing Witch in the Woods and how she leads the family to a crippling descent to hysteria and madness. Very compelling! Technically, the visuals of the film is amazing. Props to the cinematography and use of natural lighting. Music deserves high praise as well as the choice and execution REALLY builds up the dread. As for acting, amazing performance by the family particularly our debutant, Anna Taylor-Joy. Her portrayal of Thomasin was a revelation, as she renders a sincere output of hopelessness and vulnerability. Overall, the Witch is a deeply unnerving horror that has a great and well acted storyline, that feels crafted by Evil itself.

It is the sort of film that you either really like or really dislike and it is clear why. The Witch is a 1630s English folktale and it doesn't shy away from showing that. Things get very real very fast and i can easily say this is the most unnerving films i have been to see for quite some time. By that i don't mean it is a jump scare fest. I've seen a fair share of horror movies this year and all of them have been complete tripe, with countless jumpscares and a put you to sleep kind of vibe. The Witch features my favourite type of horror, the psychological type, and with that it provided something truly unique. The plot is simple, a 1630s family is torn apart and plagued by witchcraft and terrible unsettling things happen. Of course a lot more does happen, and over the course of the film i felt more and more uneasy. I have heard people complain the 1630s feel makes it boring, but never once was i bored. I was transported straight to this time period and i was transfixed to the screen for the entire duration. This is very much a family film and every member of the family does such an amazing job. The father of the family plays his role so well and you are constantly guessing what he is possibly hiding. This film will keep you guessing the whole way through, but does a stellar job at getting right inside your head and under your skin. The first scene where the witch was introduced to the audience happens quite early on, it genuinely terrified me. Not to the point i was screaming aloud and jumping out of my seat, it was a different type of terrified. I was glued to my seat, not able to take my eyes off the screen as the sounds from the speakers were ringing through my ears getting louder and louder until the scene changed and put me back into reality. All of the scenes like this were the same, they would consume and take you out of reality for a bit to remind you that what you are watching is something that could have easily happened. It was terrifying also how realistic this film actually was, i know it was only filmed over a course of 25 days but it feels like the camera crew literally went out to film a 1630s family suffering from the threat of witchcraft and put it into a 90 minute film. I love when a 90 minute film can pull you in so much that it feels like a lot longer. I hope psychological horror makes a huge comeback, i said this when i reviewed It Follows and until now, nothing had quite compared, but The Witch does. It is the best horror for a very long time and is one that i will honestly be thinking about for well over a week because that is what this genre of film does for me. Go and see it in cinemas.. but if you are faint hearted then beware because it will keep you up at night, in the best possible way.",546,5,6,False

Or maybe if it had been the opposite, that the supernatural events had been dialed up so that there was more of a story - as it was, the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.

imdb_the_witch_lisa_ravenclaw_20160712,The Witch,IMDb,lisa-ravenclaw,2016-07-12,8,Tense and haunting,"When I think of witches, I think of Halloween and Harry Potter. I remember cartoons on TV about plucky young girls casting spells and saving the day, before speeding away on a broomstick. Excitement, fun and melodrama. I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too! My point is that witches no longer frighten us. Homicidal maniacs and evil spirits tend to terrorise the protagonists of horror films today, while the witch is considered so harmless she appears almost exclusively in stories that we tell to children. The original meaning of witches, and the sinister source from which they were thought to take their magical abilities, has largely been forgotten. The Witch succeeds as a horror movie, because instead of attempting to modernise the witch, Roger Eggers' debut film reminds us of what witches once signified to people – and of how very real they seemed. The year is 1630. William and Katherine are devout Puritans who have recently emigrated to New England with their five children. Living alone on the outskirts a vast wood, they want to find the kingdom of God. When their infant son vanishes one day, the parents are distraught. They pray. They repent of their sins. But the family has unwittingly entered the domain of a witch, and evil closes in around them. The fascinating thing about The Witch is that most of the story and the dialogue is taken directly from 17th century documents and reports, meaning that people claimed to have actually witnessed the horrifying things that we see on screen. The film's events unfold to chilling music, with such a matter-of-factness and at such a steady pace that the overall effect is not only one of dread, but of mounting despair. On his knees in the rain, William pleads with God to save his children. But just like that, due to no obvious fault of their own, God has forsaken the family. Immersed in the tense, haunting world of the film, I found myself suddenly understanding the hysteria that once surrounded witches a lot better. The family disintegrates, because of the belief that witches are not born, but created when a human being pledges themselves to the devil in exchange for power. They begin to suspect that one of their own could have become a witch. Fear ultimately conquers love.",389,5,6,False

The acting is pretty great and the child actors were just as good as the adults. The cinematography is great as well, but some of the shots are ruined by bad CGI, there's a shot where the smoke from the chimney is frozen still. The script is also pretty good and the use of the dialect of the time period was interesting and worked very will. That's what I liked. I thought the pacing was really bad and it made the movie boring when things that don't directly effect the plot were happening. Speaking of the plot I did not really like the direction the film went, it felt quite anti-climactic despite some really important things happening, I felt this way because I could see where the story was going as soon as the third act started. Finally something that is very important to me is music in and out of film, and the music is this film sucked, even worse than having bad music it was so inappropriately used that it genuinely ruined quite a few scenes for me.

With it being October and fall being in full swing, I figured nows a great time as ever to finally watch The Witch. If it isn't obvious already, I plan on watching alot of ""scary/horror"" films during October as it's a perfect time to watch them. So as I continue through the month of October, I plan on watching a bunch of other horror movies I've either wanted to see or have already seen and plan on re-reveiwing them. The Witch was a very good and, honestly at times, a very chilling film. The first 10 minutes are extremely intense if you ask me and this movie has some scenes that are tough to watch which is what I think it was going for so if you dont like psychological horror, folk horror, or unsettling imaginary, you may not like this film. With that said though, because of how well it's unsettling, it truly makes this film great as it's making it's viewer actually feel something strong about what's being depicted. The cinematography is great as the entire film is very dark from start to finish and has a great dark tint over it and works phenomenally well. The shots in the woods or of the tree lines of the forest are spectacular as it felt very distinct from other films that are set in woody area. The setting is a perfect for the tales of witchcraft and cult worshipping as it was heavily feared back in that time area. The cast is stellar and they all are acting phenomenally as you feel bad for the family the more the film goes on. The ending is super creepy and with how it ended. It could actually have come full circle and almost be a infinite time loop in a way. A issue I noticed was how bad the CGI and camera shot of one seen was as it looked very weird and without spoiling anything, the scene is dealing with the Dad and the black goat for those that are curious on the scene in question. Overall this is a great movie that is a good watch espically during the fall season. The camera work, cast, and story are all stellar and how they acknowledge actual written accounts of witch's back in that area from recorded records was amazing. The only things that hold this movie back from it being a 10/10 I think is how intense it can be for casual viewings or viewers as well as that one scene I mentioned above. One last thing I didn't mention was the old English talk. I loved that but can understand some viewers struggling to follow so I'd recommend watching it with subtitles one.

Too bad the ending is fumbled.","THE WITCH is a tough movie to dislike, even as it is a tough movie to get through. It suffers from the curse of many otherwise good horror movies (such as IT FOLLOWS)...the ending stinks. Frankly, it does seem tough to find good endings to supernatural stories...once you see the horror before you, it somehow becomes less than the dread building up to it. Good horror movies and bad horror movies often suffer from it. It's a ""short story"" problem. By this, I mean...think about some of the great short stories you've read in your life. Many of them end with abrupt, surprise endings (OCCURRENCE ON OWL CREEK BRIDGE) or perhaps just sort of end (50% of modern day short stories). So you've invested 20 minutes of your time in a just so-so story. Or maybe the surprise ending is abrupt, but it's fun given how little of your time you've given up. You enjoyed the prose, and then the ending wasn't too great...but overall, you're content with the time you spent. NOW, turn that around....you've spend $20+ dollars for the pair of movie tickets. Maybe you bought snacks. You sat in the dark for 90+ minutes. And for 88 minutes, you were having a pretty good time, then suddenly the movie ends. BLAIR WITCH, THE LAST EXORCISM, etc. etc. NOW you feel cheated and disappointed. And for me, THE WITCH fell into this trap, and for that it should get a 2 star rating, perhaps. But, the building of atmosphere and dread is top notch. Some truly creepy and disturbing things happen. The movie is set in puritanical times, and follows a family that is SO puritanical, that they've been kicked out of town!! Dad is the fanatic, and of course his wife and children follow along. They build a house and homestead near a forest, and almost immediately, weird stuff starts to happen. I won't describe it all, but much involves animals and VERY creepy younger siblings. The story is told mostly through the eyes of the oldest daughter, a girl on the edge of ""womanhood"" (to use a somewhat icky cliche). I put it this way, because her own father mistrusts his daughter when he sees she's growing up. He believes we are all sinful, and women especially are not to be trusted. So when bad things start happening, who does he blame first? Anyway, the atmosphere is awesomely done, and the acting is really top notch. These are fairly inexperienced performers, but they do very, very well. And when all hell finally starts to break loose, you feel pretty bad for some of the things that start happening to these people...as alien and extreme as they may seem. And really, the entire setting and time of the film is well done. I felt that the details of everyday life, the set and costume design, etc. was all really excellent. Low budget, but never cheap. Cinematography was good. The minimal special effects were good. Only the sound mix seemed off...but I can't say if that was the theater's fault or the film. But sometimes I had a hard time understanding everyone. But I really appreciated the feeling of immersion, not just in a creepy atmosphere but into a world that felt real yet unfamiliar. This was an extra touch that really made me respond to the film. I give it four stars, but would hesitate to recommend to anyone. It's slow moving (VERY) and it disappoints with its ending.

With so many offerings in the vein of the Ring (2002), Saw (2004) AHS (American Horror Story) with the additional in vogue mashing of as many genres as possible, it's perfectly acceptable to be cynical before viewing any new horror films, wih many of todays most respected directors losing credibility in attempting to produce sophisticated, overly intricate, unnecessarily gory...well lets just say there are a lot of formulaic traps one can fall into with this genre, and fans now demanding more realism, more accuracy, continuity and authenticity and more than ever before. This film is set in the New England era of the mid 17th Century, with a small family being banished from their community for the so-called transgressions of their father who is accused of inappropriately preaching the gospels. The family (comprised of Mother and matriarch Katherine (Kate Dickie) Father William ( Ralph Ineson) eldest daughter and now hollywood celebrity (Anya Taylor-Joy in her first credited role) as Thomasin, along with younger brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) and the two youngest apart from the infant Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson). The family quickly settle on the edge of an ominous wood working hard to grow crops to survive. Early on Thomasine is playing peek-a-boo with the samll infant boy, who mysteriously vanishes into thin air - and this is when things begin to fall apart. Without spoiling the plot, I was most impressed by the clever and subtle use of the films score to build a palpable, almost visceral sense of dread coming from the dark and uninviting woods. There is also an equally palpable feeling of claustraphobia in addition to dread, and despite the family's dedication to prayer and the maxims of the church, things just keep getting worse. What is a relief is the time spent on skillfully building suspense - not though cheap jump scares or other familiar and tired tropes, but through the interactions of the characters and their deteriorating health in response to the traumas visited upon them. Anja Taylor-Joy seems to have mastered the art of the extreme close-up, and one can tell that she is a skilled actress. This film is truly eerie, haunting and suspenseful, in a way that is almost exhausting emotionally, keeping the viewer engaged - as the plot moves forward the characters true motivations are difficult to discern. I especially appreciate historical accuracy in every aspect of a period piece such as this, and despite some minor mistakes reportedly with speech accuracy, Eggers does a wonderful job in his directorial debut. I wouldn't jump to say that this is high brow, overly layered or too allegorical, as some films aim to be - this film succeeds by relying not on exclusively visual triggers but by building upon auditory(musical, instrumental and vocal), emotional (the interplay between characters and their obvious trepidation) elements as well as anticipatory suspense which heightens the tension. I was immediately reminded of the screenplay I studied in high school - 'the Crucible', a loose and questionable account of the Salem witch trials. According to the films trivia much of the material was gathered from various primary sources, personal and official accounts which must also be applauded. A great example that a horror film need not be full of monsters, ghosts and demons dripping with gore, black and white notions of 'good v evil', and other oversimplified narratives of black and white morality and/or notions of the spiritual.",603,2,1,False

The acting, dialogue, and music were all great in this film. However, at least upon my first viewing, I don't see many themes or overarching morals/ideas as I do in The Lighthouse. Something interesting I noticed is that it shares a lot of parallels with Midsommar, but with many aspects flipped. Instead of being indoctrinated, they're exiled. Instead of it being eternal day during summer, most of the horror takes place at night in winter. Instead of the evil coming from within the group, it's an external threat. Instead of beautiful visuals, it's drab and unsaturated. The VVitch also reminded me a lot of Hereditary, mostly in story arch and the ending. However, I know The VVitch came out before both of these films, so perhaps they took inspiration from The VVitch. This is still a solid movie though, and was unnerving in several parts, but seeing The Lighthouse first may have skewed my expectations a bit too high.

The emotional stakes are high and the characters' motivations are often far more complex than such a small story might allow for: the father's pride and religious fervor, the mother's love of her children and fear of Hell, the ways that the children snap at each other and use one another - all swirl around into the climactic unraveling of the family at each other's hands, and the writing and acting are phenomenal at every moment. The pacing is deliberate but never actually felt slow to me. This is partially due to the strength of the actors' performances, but is also a result of the level of detail throughout the film. I was consistently too busy trying to figure out the significance of what I was seeing to remember to be bored. The film telegraphs from an early moment that such care will be rewarded, and then keeps its promise to the viewer. The sound track helps, too: it is fantastic, and could stand easily on its own as a masterpiece of dark ambient music.",210,2,1,False

imdb_the_witch_mcfeadynm_20241230,The Witch,IMDb,mcfeadynm,2024-12-30,10,A Chilling Descent into 17th-Century Madness:,"I just emerged from the most unsettling and thought-provoking cinematic experience of my life - ""The Witch: A New-England Folktale"" (2015). Robert Eggers' directorial debut is a masterclass in building tension, crafting atmosphere, and exploring the darker aspects of human nature. From the opening scenes, I was transported to the eerie and isolated world of 17th-century New England. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the bleak beauty of the wilderness and the sense of foreboding that permeates every frame. The use of natural lighting, coupled with the eerie sound design, creates an immersive experience that draws you in and refuses to let go. The cast delivers performances that are both nuanced and captivating. Anya Taylor-Joy shines as Thomasin, the eldest daughter of the Puritan family, bringing a sense of vulnerability and determination to the role. The chemistry between the family members is palpable, making their descent into madness and paranoia all the more believable and terrifying. What sets ""The Witch"" apart from other horror movies is its thoughtful exploration of themes such as fear, superstition, and the dangers of unchecked paranoia. The film raises important questions about the nature of evil and the consequences of allowing fear to consume us. One of the standout aspects of ""The Witch"" is its commitment to historical accuracy. The film's attention to detail, from the costumes to the set design, creates a sense of authenticity that adds to the overall sense of unease and tension. Overall, ""The Witch"" is a masterpiece of psychological horror that will appeal to fans of slow-burning, atmospheric terror. With its stunning cinematography, captivating performances, and thought-provoking themes, this film is a must-see for anyone who loves horror movies that challenge and unsettle. Recommendation: If you enjoyed films like ""The Shining"", ""The Exorcist"", or ""Rosemary's Baby"", you'll love ""The Witch"".",299,2,1,False

imdb_the_witch_elvis_del_valle_20241216,The Witch,IMDb,Elvis-Del-Valle,2024-12-16,9,A traditional horror tale that brings something new to the genre,"When Robert Eggers made his three short films, he proved that he was a visionary, and with his first feature film he has proven it. The Witch is a film that presents a different vision of the horror genre. It is a film that offers a visual and atmospheric narrative that keeps the story moving. The film goes back to the deep roots of the world of witchcraft and Eggers captures it with his dark vision that he has been developing since his short films. Eggers has always been interested in witches since he was a child and based on many sources, he managed to create a film that revives the theme of witches. Folkloric horror films that dealt with witches had been forgotten for a long time and The Witch rekindles the flames of this type of film. The film also takes faith as an essential element in the conflict that the main family must face. It is about a very devout family, but they end up being victims of paranoia when the witch of the forest shows up and through the disappearance of the family's baby, the nightmare begins. What happens is something that could be familiar to The Shinning because this family disintegrates to the point that they use violence against each other. The paranoia that the family suffers seems to be an equivalent of the terror and distrust that was had in the time of The Holy Inquisition. A feeling that led to anyone who was accused of witchcraft ending up being executed. In the film, this is seen when Thomasin plays a joke on her younger brothers saying that she is a witch and that joke backfires on her. The accusations are then directed at Jonas and Mercy for engaging in conversations with a goat. Back then, this kind of thing was enough to accuse someone of witchcraft. The film portrays this terror towards witches from a psychological perspective because the witch of the forest uses the fear of the family as a tool to destroy each other. What is curious is that the victim family is a group that was expelled from a colony for discussing issues about religion. William must have said some heresy or something to be banished with his family. The truth is that this is a family whose faith is tested, but that faith is either weakened or used against them. One of the weak points seen in this family is when Caleb looks at Thomasin's chest implying that he is attracted to her sister and since that is considered a sin, it makes him an easy target for a young witch who comes to him. There may also be a deeper meaning to the story involving young Thomasin. She is initially presented as a servant who is treated with a certain amount of discipline and when we see everything from Satan making her an offer to the end of the film, it is most likely that Thomasin is a young woman who has been repressed by her family's beliefs and was able to break free from it. In an analogy, this could be a representation of desires that are repressed due to the beliefs of a family or community because they are considered immoral or sinful, but in the end those desires end up being accepted and released. The accusations that Thomasin suffers become a reason for her not to trust her family's faith and it is curious that she calls her father a ""hypocrite"" in one scene. The acceptance of desires has to do with the struggle between society and nature, since human desires are something given by nature and witches have always been linked to nature. In the religion created by society it is the opposite because it establishes that the human being is not a beast and must separate himself from nature to find perfection. In short, society and civilization are the true path that man must take. Something that could also be deduced is that the tricks that the forces of evil use to make the family destroy each other are an incentive for Thomasin to turn her back on God and accept the path of temptation. Satan's offer also mentions a promising life and when Thomasin loses everything, it is clear that there is no other way out. There are quite a few interesting things to be learned from this film, such as the restrictions of Christianity, faith put to the test, the medieval fear of witches, paranoia in the time of the Inquisition, the liberation of desires, the struggle between the moral and the immoral, temptation and the loss of faith. All of this is served with an ingenious cocktail of atmospheric terror that knew how to capture the lore of witches and the influence they have had on people's fears in ancient times. The movie doesn't necessarily have to show the situations because it is much more subtle and lets the atmosphere do the work. As has been the case in his previous short films, the tension that Robert Eggers uses is what makes this film gripping. The horror that this film offers is oriented towards the environmental and psychological and it does so in an ingenious way. It manages to be disturbing because of its subtlety and has been the most refreshing film that could have been made at a time when Blumhouse films were dominating the genre. The Witch is an ingenious film that respects the mythology of witches according to Christianity and something that helped bring something new to the genre. Robert Eggers certainly managed to start his film career in a very promising way. My final rating for this film is a 9/10.",955,2,1,False

Based on the time this takes place, they did a great job on making it appear as though it is in that time. The dialogue is the same as well. But the plot is confusing, you will eventually get lost. It's not really a horror movie until the final 15 minutes. The rest is just a boring story of a family surviving for the winter. This film is so dead with zero tensity.

This movie is about a pious family that left the colony and settled near the forest. One day the little brother of Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) called Sam disappeared and they blame the wolves for kidnapping him. Over time strange things start to happen. This movie is inspired by period writings from the court or newspaper and most of the dialogues are from these writings. This movie is a very good indie drama and horror with a witch theme. You won't find another indie movie with this theme that would be on the same level. The performance of the actors was overwhelming. The whole course of the screenplay is very good and detailed written. Movie can engulf you to the action that you will be worried about. In this movie you will not find any horror cliché, this makes the movie unique. Horror atmosphere was very good and very rigorously built. Costumes were very authentic. Disgusting scenes were very well created. This is not a classic horror movie which bets on jumpscares, this movie bets on atmosphere and intense situations.

imdb_the_witch_mrhunter_55431_20210406,The Witch,IMDb,mrhunter-55431,2021-04-06,9,The Witch very good.,"A large family is kicked out of the village because of their faith. They moved to live in a house near the forest. They had another child, who was named Sam. Sam's mother went about her business, so his sister, Thomasin, looked after him. Thomasin played with him. She covered her eyes with her hands and hid in this way. And when she closed her eyes the next time, Sam mysteriously disappeared. The family thinks it could be a wolf, but is it really so? The action of the film takes place near the forest. As we all know about the forest there are many tales, and the film adapts one of them. Personally, I love this style, the darkness and mystery of the forest always attracts and frightens at the same time. I immediately noticed that the film was similar to the 2019 release of Lighthouse. As it turns out they have one director, Robert Eggers. This director has a very different style from the others. It is easy to recognize for many factors. Music is one of such factors. In the film, a pumping chorus is used. That in the Lighthouse and in the Witch, the soundtracks were superimposed on what was happening in the frame, that is, there were no sounds other than the loud chorus of girls. Also, the chaos that occurs in the frame distinguishes Robert's style. In the scene, they can shout at the same time, pray and the music also plays. This intensifies quite strongly. By itself, you start to worry and fear. I'm glad that I was afraid not because of sharp screamers, but because of The plot is so intriguing that I did not leave the monitor and watched with interest. A lot of bad things were said on the Witch, the audience did not appreciate him, like May. But I liked these two works and I highly appreciated them. I liked Robert as a director and screenwriter of these pictures. I think his robots are specific, but there are fans of such films. 9/10.",344,2,1,False

The acting was very good. You could tell each actor was thoroughly into their roles. Also the cinematography was beautiful. Some of the shots of the characters walking in the forest stand out the most in my mind. Apart from that it was a horrid mess. The characters speak in this form of old English that is barely understandable. This film needs subtitles desperately. Get ready to be completely disoriented by this films plot. Lots of things happen and they will never be explained or addressed (like a certain scene involving a crow or the kissing scene). The biggest problem I found with this movie is that it is boring. The big 'payoffs' in the plot are dull and left me more confused. The film's ending could have been much stronger if the witches were more developed as characters. Instead you are left with an ending that feels duct taped to the rest of the film. It feels really out of place and is a little too sci fi channel ""B-movie"" in my opinion.

imdb_the_witch_vangondour_20191203,The Witch,IMDb,vangondour,2019-12-03,8,A fantastic directorial debut from Robert Eggers,"So I recently watched Robert Eggers directorial debut, the 2015 horror film 'The VVitch' and it was pretty good. I've been excited to see this movie for a while due to the critical and financial success it garnered in it's opening week, I never had a proper chance to view it until now and I can say that I am satisfied. The film centres around a small family in the 1780s living in a cottage just off the edge if the woods where strange occurrences begin to happen to them and they have no idea what's causing them as they slowly fall into madness pointing fingers at each other. The story is simple yet effective, the thing that helps seperate this film from others that came out in it's time was how it chose to focus on the characters and how they are coping with the situation they find themselves in rather than placing the focus on cheap jumpscares and monster effects. The script really makes you invested in the story and characters to the point where I wouldn't even really class it as a horror movie and more of a fantasy drama. Like I said this was Robert Eggers first time helming a film and I'd say he did a good job, the directing is crisp and meaningful with a lot of thought clearly put into it. The cinematography by Jarin Blaschke was by far the best thing about the film with plenty of intricate shots and moments that were rather ambitious in scale and I don't believe could've been accomplished without the combined efforts of both the director and cinematographer. The acting was great for the most part although there are some lines and moments that in my opinion could've been done better from the child actors in the film, that being said a lot of the time child actors really suck but these ones actually delivered a convincing performance. The music was great and really helped add to the creepy atmosphere the film was going for. The primary problem I encountered from having a fully immersive experience was that the characters speak in a very old dialect that I found incredibly hard to understand even at full volume, I eventually had to turn on subtitles to just understand what was actually happening in I had to keep them on for the duration of the movie. No idea if it was just my tv and if i could have had a more fulfilling experience in a theatre, regardless it hurt my enjoyment quite a bit.

There is plenty of buildup without much resolution, along with an overwhelming focus on story and character development, rather than actual scares. If it was intending to make audience members fearful, it would have failed, but I do not believe that to be the intention. Artistically and analytically, this film is a masterpiece. The symbolism is heavy, with depictions of goats, ravens, apples, the color red, etc. All of these have been, not coincidentally, used as symbols of witchcraft in past forms of media.

Without giving much away, a Puritan family is banished from their community, because their preacher father is in disagreement with the ruling council of the village. They strike out into the wilderness, where it is rumored that dark things lurk in the woods and try to make a life of their own. It is a slow burn film that takes its time establishing a claustrophobic feeling of dread with elements of the supernatural slowly taking root.

imdb_the_witch_brando647_20170324,The Witch,IMDb,brando647,2017-03-24,9,THE WITCH is One of the Best Horror Films in Recent Years,"I love THE WITCH. The film is a period horror film from writer/director Robert Eggers, a man I'd never heard of but whose work I will be looking out for in the future. THE WITCH is haunting, methodical, suspenseful, and obsessed with detail. Listening to Eggers' commentary for the film, it's obvious the man has a fascination with early American life and their supernatural superstitions. It's no surprise. THE WITCH must've been a passion project brewing in his mind for a good while because he put every ounce of attention into it. It's the tale of a Puritan family in 1630's Massachusetts who are exiled from their community for the father's overbearing religious preachings that don't quite mesh with their own local beliefs. And so William (Ralph Ineson) and his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) pack up their children and move out into the woods to start their own little farmstead. Flash forward to sometime later, the family has settled in and built a home, started a little farm, and have welcomed their fifth child. One afternoon, the infant Samuel disappears right out from under the nose of eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). At the same time, the family crops are mysteriously dying and their animals aren't providing. The winter is approaching, their food is scarce, their youngest child is missing and presumed dead, and strange happenings lead to hushed accusations of witchcraft; there is something evil beyond the tree line and they start to fear a dark presence amongst them. With little exception, everything in this movie works 100%. It really is one of the strongest horror films I've seen in years. I love that it doesn't have to rely on jump scares and gratuitous violence or gore. Don't get me wrong, it has those but it doesn't rely on them. When Samuel disappears mid-peek-a-boo, it's just as jarring as any jump scare and, while the family is ignorant of poor Samuel's ultimate fate, we the audience are privy to it and it'll make your skin crawl. Instead of slapping you across the face with horror clichés, THE WITCH builds a tension over the course of the movie. It starts with Samuel's disappearance. Then we see the family begin to buckle under the pressure. Poor Katherine is losing her mind in grief and the two youngest children, Jonas and Mercy, become increasingly more insufferable, teasing Thomasin that Black Peter (the family's black ram) speaks to them of her wickedness. Thomasin becomes a target for Katherine's angst and poor William, who hasn't had the greatest luck since moving his family to the middle of the woods to start a new life, is doing everything in his power to keep the peace. THE WITCH is just as much a psychological thriller as it is a traditional horror. These people are isolated from the rest of society and super religious; the idea that someone in their little family might be in league with Satan is something they're actually willing to consider. It's unnerving. Of course, this is a horror film and the movie establishes that it isn't just paranoia from the very beginning. We, the audience, know of the witch in the woods. What we don't know is whether anyone in the family might be working in conjunction with it. Are the children telling the truth about whisperings from Black Peter? Or are the accusations lobbied against Thomasin based on truth? The very idea that one of the children might've dabbled in the dark arts is enough to tear the family apart in fear and suspicion. It's absolutely enthralling to watch. While everyone in this film delivers standout performances (well, except maybe Harvey Scrimshaw as middle child Caleb some of his stuff didn't sit right with me), the real accolades belong to Ralph Ineson and Anya Taylor-Joy. Ineson was perfectly cast in the role as the devout Puritan and loving father to the struggling family and elicits the most sympathy as a man just trying to keep it all together, but Taylor-Joy just knocks it out as Thomasin. From the start, she's a tormented girl. She seems absolutely miserable at the news that her family's been exiled and, despite trying her best to do her part, she keeps coming under fire from her grieving mother. There's no hesitation from her mother in blaming her when something goes wrong and the youngest children are just a royal pain. Her performance walks a line where you aren't sure if she's just good at bottling up her issues in the face of her family or if she's got something going on the side, like maybe some demonic-aided retribution against her tormentors. And I haven't even raved about how much I love the production and costume design. Eggers really went for full immersion, with period-accurate dialogue and everything. He admits to taking a few creative licenses with some aspects to better suit the story but THE WITCH, with all the talent involved in front of and behind the camera, is one of the most authentic-feeling period pieces I've seen. This all adds immeasurably to the well-written story and amazing character performances. THE WITCH won't satisfy all horror fans, and the pacing may bore some others, but it's an enthusiastic recommend from me.",875,5,7,False

Most horror films, especially ones with as much publicity as this one, are reliant on the usual mix of jump-scares and over the top gore with not much substance at their core other than a bit of exhilarating blood-splattering fun. This film draws you into its world brilliantly through simple and effective devices like dim candlelight, claustrophobic rooms and thoroughly believable acting. It builds wonderfully and each of the horrific and eerie moments come at just the right time and aren't overdone. You become entrenched in the world of a small farm house by a big spooky woods through the eyes of the religious fervour and fears of an ordinary family in 1630. It is mesmerising, hypnotic and eerily thrilling and the faithfulness of the research done by its creators to portray the time as historically accurate is impressive. This is a film that I believe will be regarded as a classic in years to come, much in the vein of films like The Wicker Man. It is a timeless horror that will resound as much in ten or twenty years as it would have done twenty years ago. The essential elements of good filmmaking and horror story are all accounted for here. I heavily recommend this film to anyone interested in horror, history or drama.",250,4,5,False
imdb_the_witch_yourfavoritecritic_20201102,The Witch,IMDb,yourfavoritecritic,2020-11-02,10,Not for Everyone,"""The Witch"" is the directorial debut from Robert Eggers and is about a series of unfortunate events plaguing a family after they choose to depart from their village. ""The Witch"" stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie. Now this was a film I was quite looking forward to as I am a huge horror movie geek and I had heard nothing but positive things about the film. Now I must say this was probably my favourite film I have seen so far this year, however it is not for everyone. Just everything about this film I thought was incredible, just on a technical stand point the cinematography in this film was a sight to see and adds so much to this enthralling story which you can so easily get lost in. This movie was very interesting for the fact that it takes place in the 1630's and includes a mix of shakespearian and modern english dialogue which could have went one of two ways, either it'll sound really forced coming from the actors or they'll sound completely genuine and the audience will totally buy into the schtick. Luckily this is a case of all the actors being completely stellar and strong enough to deliver these performances that were shown in this movie, I did not think there was one flat performance and even when one of the actors seemed to falter he really won me back with a deeply disturbing scene where he just lets loose. Now like I was saying this movie will not be for everybody, many people will go into this expecting a horror film similar to many of the mainstream horror movies released nowadays and they will be thoroughly disappointed as ""The Witch"" is not one of those films flushed out with a bunch of jumpscares. This is a methodical film that takes its time to build itself up and some people may not be used to that and I am here to to tell you today that even though this film advertises seeing the witch itself, you actually see the witch less in this movie than you do the babadook in ""The Babadook"", this is not meant as a spoiler but more of a warning. So ""The Witch"" was a deeply suspenseful film that affected me on many levels, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen through the whole runtime, the score for this film was another profound aspect, I absolutely loved the way the it built up. Though I had slight problems with the film such as the strong english accents being hard to understand sometimes and colour palette being too grey at times, they didn't detract away from the film, for that reason ""The Witch"" receives a 10/10.",457,3,3,False

The production of this films is one of my favorites as it was almost all done practically. The dialogue and it's use of Old English is amazing and proves Eggers is a master of his craft despite it being his first role directing. The use of sound in this film is my new favorite for a horror movie with its use of chants and silence. The light from candle and the darkness really add to the eeriness. I can not praise Eggers enough for this as it was his first movie he ever directed and makes me want to see his new movie The Lighthouse even more. The film is probably the scariest horror movie I have ever seen(it might have been where and when I watched it but I do not believe this is true).

The Witch excels in all facets. The performances are pitch perfect, unnerving and believable.

Now I've been really excited for this movie for a while and now that I've seen it, I can honestly say that this one of the best directed movies I've ever seen from a first-time director. First off, all the performances in this movie are amazing, especially from the oldest daughter (Anya Taylor- Joy) and the father (Ralph Ineson). All of the actors aren't well-known so it was nice to see some new actors to look out for. Also, the tone and atmosphere make this movie what it is. This movie is really creepy, disturbing and, at some points, really hard to watch. Also, the musical score for this movie helps you feel the tension and uneasiness of what's happening. The cinematography and look of the movie also help set the tone. The movie is slow-paced and there are a lot of wide shots and it worked perfectly for this movie. Lastly, the ending was really disturbing and interesting. It's the kind of ending that is left up for interpretation and leaves the audience thinking about what it means exactly. If I were to say anything bad, it would be that this is not our typical modern-day horror movie. Compared to the horror movies that come out today, this is a slow-paced movie that will probably leave a lot of typical moviegoers bored and wanting more. This might be because of the way this movie is marketed, which shows it as a full-on horror flick specifically about a witch.

Writer-director Robert Eggers' viciously delicious slowburner represents all that's good about low-budget terror. Shunning his religious community, patriarch William and his family take to the wilderness to try and start anew. Misfortune however, seems to plagued the venture at every turn, not only does the crop keep failing but their infant son disappears, seemingly gobbled up by the ominous woods looming large over the family' habitat. As conditions worsen, the family unit begins to self-destruct, all under the watchful eye of the households malevolent billy goat Black Phillip. Making rumbles since its debut at Sundance 2015, The Witch has been long awaited by yours truly. Did it live up to expectations? Did it ever! The Witch is an amazingly taut and focused horror movie. Debutant Eggers has an iron tight grip on proceedings and shows no qualms about how he's going to go about telling his story. The script, cinematography, acting and score, all of the highest order, effortlessly amalgamates into one hell of an unsettling and disturbing horror experience. Best of all, he manages all of this without pandering to the lowest common denominator, instead trusting the audience to find their own way in getting his point across. Last but certainly not least, special props must go to the amazing creation that is Black Phillip, a 210-pound billy goat named Charlie, who apparently ran roughshod over the cast and crew during production. Well I'm here tell you that their trails and pain was worth it as Phillip (short as his appearance may be) will no doubt join the annals of horror lore as one of the greatest animal performers ever, so effective is his performance in the film. As a matter of fact, He might as well rise onto his hind legs - now rather the later - and violently bang his majestic horns at the endless night sky, bellowing out in celebration as he and his fellows have just crafted one of the greatest horror offerings of the 21th century.

The writer/director takes away any sense of lingering mystery, he takes away any want or need we may have had to watch the film again. It's like watching a painter dump a bucket of water all over a painting we just watched them meticulously paint for hours. It all seems like a complete waste. And it is. The trailers for The Witch are more frightening than the film itself. However, The Witch's biggest sin is how forgettable it all is in the end. And that is unforgivable.",234,11,13,False

The filmmakers went further than anyone has before in authentically recreating the time period and place, very early colonial New England, and the language the characters use may be initially off-putting but do what I did, turn subtitles on and make an effort to try to appreciate real historical accuracy that took a lot of effort in the face of being unpopular. If you are honest with yourself, you'll admit that you are following what's going on just fine and the realism is what sells the film. It gives more credit to the depiction of the ""true"" stories that were used to inspire the film. There is just the right amount of....witchery.... to be completely terrifying and seem as though it really could be something that really did happen. Any more focus away from a more ""normal"" setting, any more footage of witchcraft would have taken away from the power of what we ARE shown. Yes, it is a supernatural based horror film, but its dedication to historical accuracy makes it come off feeling so real, so possible, so plausible, and if you give yourself over to it, it becomes absolutely believable, as well as giving us today a better understanding of just how horrifying witchcraft was to people of that era, almost to the point of understanding why the witch trials of early America took such a hold over people, people who didn't have beliefs more rooted in science and reason. Witches were accepted as fact and if you submit to the movie and suspend that disbelief, you'll see how terrified those people might have been when coming face to face with what they believed to be credible stories of witches and witchcraft. And if it just did happen to be real, witchcraft I mean, this is the indisputably most accurate depiction of real witches. So glad to have been alive at a time like this and to have watched it.

A vivid depiction of descending into madness and genuinely disturbing, everything about The Witch builds anxiety. The film doesn't have many overt jump scares, but, instead, leaves a haunting impression. Diligently true to its time period and centered around the dominant religious views of that era, The Witch touches on very real subjects and closely examines a significant aspect of American heritage. The supernatural elements loom in the background because they are accents for this tense look at devout households. Meanwhile, this film is crafted perfectly. The writing is laced with complex themes and ripe for interpretations, yet the story is clear and concise. The music is deeply unsettling without distracting. The acting is downright astonishing because the foreign dialect is presented effortlessly and each character provides elaborate layers to digest. The visuals, editing, and sound design are expertly tailored to build panic, uncertainty, and despair. Natural overcast lighting, hypnotic cuts, and restrained sound all contribute to feelings of impending doom.

With a lot of horrific movies out there, this movie defied their expectations so hard that they wrote this one and only review, that's pretty telling! Main reason to review it badly was that ""It wasn't scary"". In my opinion the trailer for ""The Witch"" is at fault in this case, the movie is described here as: ""One of the most genuinely unnerving horror film in recent memory"" David Ehrlich or ""A nightmarish picture that will make your blood run cold"" Rodrigo Perez, accompanied by the ""scariest"" images taken from the movie and dramatic score, sadly trailer did this movie a big disfavor. Meanwhile on the poster we can only read ""The New England Folktale. Evil takes many forms"" well that's more like it! To get things straight, ""The Witch"" It is not a horror movie, although it contains many elements of good horrors like the sense of dread, despair, distrust, confusion or doom. But never are those emotions played to please the audiences need to be scared. It is rather the contrary, where the movie dissects and tries to explain where all those emotions may come from, meandering at the same time between reality and fable-tale, challenging you to answer what is true, and what really disturbs you as a viewer.

imdb_the_witch_zkonedog_20170224,The Witch,IMDb,zkonedog,2017-02-24,10,The Folktale Aspect Is Key Here,"While being touted as a ""horror flick"", ""The Witch"" only shares that designation in the sense that the events depicted within it can be quite unsettling. It is nowhere near, however, the type of movie that most theater-goers these days would consider ""horror"". It has nothing in common with, say, ""Paranormal Activity"", which uses jump-scares to produce its frights. No, ""The Witch"" is a much more subtle type of scary, the type that unspools with each minute as you begin to gain a deeper understanding of how troubling the situation is becoming. For a very basic overview, ""The Witch"" tells the story of a family in 1630s New England. Father William (Ralph Ineson) has a major falling-out with the religious community in his village, forcing him to be excommunicated and banished to the wilderness lands where he must begin a new life with wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), well-meaning son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and two young twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson). There is also an infant boy in tow, who quickly disappears near the edge of the forest. The family suspects witchcraft, but is there really paranormal activity afoot? Also, suspicions are raised that perhaps Thomasin herself knows more than she is letting on. On of the biggest keys to keep in mind while watching this movie is that director Robert Eggers makes no bones about the the fact that the story is essentially an amalgamation of real-life accounts from the time period, an era when people believed far different things than what we generally do now when it comes to things like religion and the paranormal. So even if certain on-screen events seem absurd, far-fetched, or don't 100% always make sense, remember that they are all basically drawn straight from the mouths of real people. There are many deep and interesting themes in ""The Witch"": One big one is the role religion plays in the life of the family. Despite (or perhaps because of?) their devout Christianity, the mother and father are quick to contemplate witchcraft and relate it to a supposed lack of piety. Another interesting theme centers on familial relationships. The mother and father are constantly at odds about how to live their lives, especially with Thomasin just coming into her womanhood and brother Caleb's not-so-subtle noticing of that very fact. Even the little twins, who seem innocent, manage to rile up a family goat (named ""Black Phillip"") and are quick to point fingers (as children are wont to do) at a sibling's transgressions. It's a potent family mix that only becomes more combustible when the overriding religious concepts are thrown into the fray. Pacing-wise, ""The Witch"" uses a simmering or building of tension almost like a Hitchcock flick, where the suspense is given more screen time than the ""big reveal"". Whereas horror fans are used to being jump-scared out of their seats, ""The Witch"" again and again takes you just to the point of terror and then backs off. The ending of the film--which I won't spoil here--is going to rub some people the wrong way. Again, however, please remember how it was constructed from actual journals, writings, and other documents of New Englanders from that time period. It tries to be as authentic as possible in that vein, which obviously makes it difficult to construct a narrative around which contemporary audiences will appreciate. Eggers does the best he can, but the ending simply requires as much obliqueness as finality. Overall, I think that two words--""reflection"" & ""thought""--really are the key to appreciating ""The Witch"". If you are expecting a movie where every few minutes the tension builds and something jumps out, you might be disappointed. Instead, the real horror of ""The Witch"" probably comes as much after the viewing process and you begin to process what you just saw. The combination of fanatical religion, 1600s family dynamics, and the supernatural elements will give you plenty to think about for days afterward.",663,4,6,False

Either reaction would be legitimate, as its unsettling visuals and themes are as enveloping as they are hard-to-stomach. Less a forceful, shocking horror than an atmospheric vision of fear, these two disparate effects point to the same truth: The Witch is an overwhelming experience of sheer terror. Set in 17th century New England, teenager Thomasin and her family are banished from their paranoid town and forced to make a life of their own. As witchcraft and black magic begin to make their way out of the neighboring woods and into the family's life, things go from bad to worse. Newcomer Eggers directs with such fervency for authenticity, it feels like he time-traveled to capture this unique era for horror. His characters carry all the affectations you expect of the period (old-fashioned English, enclosed communities), but more importantly, each member of the small cast is layered with empathy and dark humanity. Those characters, coupled with the dreary beauty of the visuals and the mesmerizing score, give us a clear first-look at a fearless talent. Eggers not only has a handle on the surface level aesthetics, but dives into some deep wells of thought, like religion vs. spirituality and the very notion of innocence.

imdb_the_witch_eddie_baggins_20160502,The Witch,IMDb,eddie_baggins,2016-05-02,8,A masterful example of mood and chills,"Forgoing the jump scare and gore tactics that have inhabited and tarnished the horror genre over the last decade, first time filmmaker Robert Eggers has with his old English folktale The Witch (a film Jordan nominated as his most anticipated of the year) created an utterly unnerving and moody piece of horror filmmaking that whilst won't have audiences covering their eyes, will most certainly have them squirming in their seats and feeling incredibly uneasy during and after proceedings. Tinged with the religious zealously and witch fearing pandemonium that infested the landscape in which The Witch is based in, Eggers has created something refreshingly unique with his picture, from the Ye Olde English dialogue which itself is based on writings of the day, through to the atmospheric capturing of its countryside and regardless of genre, The Witch is undoubtedly one of the most effective films in some time concerning its ability to draw the viewer into its particular mood, which in this case is pure palpable dread from its first frame through to its last horrific hoorah. Centering this period tale almost exclusively within the confines of a Puritan Family's lowly farm, after their fatherly patriarch William (played effectively by Ralph Ineson) is excommunicated by a local plantation community and the family is banished to the edges of woods that are quite possibly haunted by a witch or witches, Eggers manages to draw out scene after scene of tension riddled family and spiritual dramas that are expertly crafted and effectively played out by its actors. Showcasing skills as a writer and director, The Witch also signals Eggers ability with actors and in particular young performers with both Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw as well-meaning brother and sister Thomasin and Caleb respectively delivering above average turns for actors of their age and tasked with delivering hefty material, The Witch finds itself in safe hands whenever these two teenagers take center stage. It must also be noted that Eggers shows himself a deft hand with animals as well, Black Phillip the goat and a seemingly nefarious bunny rabbit hold their own in this not for the faint of heart experience. Not a film for those that have become accustomed to their horror in the form of cheap Hollywood knockoffs and anthologies that have lasted long after their use by dates, The Witch may not be perfect horror but it's about as close as your likely to get in today's climate and based on this memorable and disquieting experience (who or what exactly is the titular witch?), Eggers is a filmmaker that could well be the savior of modern day horror, not a bad feat by a director on debut. 4 thirsty crows out of 5",452,3,4,False
imdb_the_witch_keithbrown_90195_20160911,The Witch,IMDb,keithbrown-90195,2016-09-11,9,Pure Atmospheric Dread,"Let me begin by saying this is perfectly constructed to recreate the feeling and mood of the time period. And even before the supernatural elements begin the cinematic frame is claustrophobic as the family leaves the plantation, and the disturbing sound design has constant wind and animal noises underlying the action. Natural lighting shrouds the film in darkness, and the time-appropriate dialogue has an edge of madness. The farm is under constant overcast, and the wood surrounding it has no traces of green or even the hint of something better around the corner. This is film making so precise it would be unnerving if we were to simply watch the family try and make it through the winter. Shortly into the movie, we're introduced to a figure in the woods. We're also introduced to a skin-crawling score that takes this movie to a new level of unease. Scenes that depict the daily routine of trying to survive on a barren farm are marked with dread; the inner-family fighting occasionally boils to the surface in moments of fear and rage; and lonely figures walking through the woods are under constant threat of the demon that lurks within. I'm still trying to wrestle with the meaning of the title of the movie, because there were questions I had throughout that I'm not sure were cleared up by the ending, or muddled even further. I do like the suggestion that the powers of the satanic forces were working to tear the family apart from within. By the end, it contains some of the most frightening moments and images in recent cinema. There's a laugh that I'll never ever forget. And then there's that goat, Black Phillip.",283,3,4,False

imdb_the_witch_gatheringsnow_20170424,The Witch,IMDb,gatheringsnow,2017-04-24,10,Something Evil in the Woods...,"The Witch, or the VVitch, as it is so cleverly marketed, is one of the finest examples of supernatural horror I've seen in a film for quite some time, and considering the current trend of jump-scare laden cheese-fests, that's definitely saying something. Even more shocking than the film itself perhaps is the fact that this is the directorial debut of writer/director Robert Eggers, a New England native who skillfully drew from his childhood surroundings of isolated colonial farmhouses and lonely cemeteries in the middle of the woods as inspiration for this film. Cold, haunting, dreary, and sinister are all words which come to mind when describing the look and atmosphere of this finely-crafted work of art. From start to finish a creeping sense of primeval dread and suspense embodies every scene in one way or another. Taking place in 17th century New England, the film focuses on a Puritan family, father William (Ralph Ineson), mother Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), adolescent son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson), as they are banished from their colonial settlement due to being too severe in their interpretation of the scriptures even by Puritan standards. They travel into a deeply wooded, isolated region where they settle down, build a farmhouse, and try to start anew, with a newborn son, Samuel, soon arriving and bringing a tinge of joy to an otherwise dour household. However, other, unknown forces of evil are congregating just beyond the confines of their land, and it isn't long before they begin seeping into the lives of the family itself. The land itself is not very fertile and soon the crops begin to fail, and the animals, especially a goat innocuously named Black Phillip, begin acting strange and unnatural. Then things take a turn for the worse when the infant son Samuel, who was yet unbaptized, is abducted under mysterious circumstances. Teenage daughter Thomasin, who was supposed to be looking after him when he disappeared, immediately falls under suspicion from the family and that's when things begin to get truly terrifying, for both the audience and the unfortunate family being tormented by some unseen evil lurking in the woods. The Witch is not your standard horror film, as while it does have horror elements, parts of it also play out like a period drama a la The Crucible, a film which is often compared to this due to the similar settings/characters. However, while The Crucible is more about the dangers of mass hysteria and religious fanaticism, as opposed to witchcraft and sorcery, The Witch makes it far more clear that it's not simply paranoia slowly tearing the family apart, but something very real and very dangerous. The film moves at a rather slow pace, and doesn't feature any jump scares or any of the usual clichés found in horror movies nowadays, which is actually very refreshing. In addition to that the soundtrack and cinematography perfectly compliment the film and add an extra dimension to the horrific plot as it slowly unfolds. As the family situation continually spirals downward into madness and chaos, and the family turns against one another out of fear and suspicion, the supernatural horrors of the surrounding forest become more and more evident, less subtle, and more terrifying, with a truly unexpected and shocking conclusion that I feel most viewers will not be able to predict, due to the very unpredictable nature of the film itself. In addition to the human characters, the animals and even the forest itself function as developed characters in their own right, perfectly complimenting the overall plot/story. Overall I highly recommend this film for viewers who are looking for something different than standard modern-day horror fare, with a style that is more reminiscent of old-fashioned classics like The Innocents or The Haunting, with a dread-filled atmosphere, and slowly ratcheting suspense over explicit violence and gore. You won't be disappointed, Robert Eggers is a truly a force to be reckoned with.",668,3,4,False

The last name free Puritan family of William (Ralph Ineson), wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), daughters Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) Mercy (Ellie Grainger), and sons, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Mercy's twin, Jonas (Lucas Dawson) and infant son Samuel are the main characters in this story. The story takes place in 1630, 10 years after the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts. The family is incredibly zealous even by Puritan standards and this doesn't set well with the community who kicks them out. William is determined his family will not let the woods tear them apart and the farm will be a thriving one. The life of the family literally goes to hell when baby Samuel vanishes while Thomasin is watching him. The crops begin to die and the chickens lay dead eggs and the goat gives blood instead of milk. The one animal on the farm that gives the most grief is Black Philip. The twins claim he talks to them and they also claim Thomasin is a witch. The only real witch in the story is the one who killed Samuel and who seduced Caleb when the older boy went out for food for the family. Caleb comes back naked and delirious. He is in hysterics in bed and this wears out his heart and he dies. Mercy and Jonas don't help matters either when they both collapse on the ground in hysterics as well! In the end, the whole family except for Thomasin is killed. William is gored to death by Black Philip while Katherine is killed by Thomasin in self-defense. Katherine tried to strangle her daughter and Thomasin stopped her. Black Philip is really the devil who set in motion all the bad things that happened to the family. He has Thomasin sign the book he has and leads her to the woods after she strips naked. Thomasin is now apart of the coven of witches in the woods and in a weird way is much happier now. Before everyone made her feel like she was a witch and abnormal because she was a teenage girl struggling with puberty. This was a very interesting, scary movie about how a belief system can turn people against each other. This family forgot about love and acceptance all belief systems should have and the devil was able to get a hold of them. All the characters were excellent with special mention paid to Anya Taylor-Joy as the misunderstood Thomasin! Robert Eggers really did his homework in regards to the language, clothing, and religion of the time and it shows!",446,4,7,False
imdb_the_witch_i_ailurophile_20210315,The Witch,IMDb,I_Ailurophile,2021-03-15,10,"A masterstroke of horror, and cinema at large","We've seen many movies before about unseen terrors and mounting ill omens befalling a family. But not like this. We can talk about the blood and gore. We can talk about the obvious supernatural elements that go beyond reality as it's known in-universe. We can talk about the dark, depressive, disturbing atmosphere, suspense, and mystery that only deepens and grows as the film progresses. We can talk about the acutely shocking moments, presented in a deliberately understated way, that in other pictures would get all the focus of the camera. These are all reasons why 'The witch' is horror, but still only scratch the surface of what makes it so gripping, and such an essential film to watch. 'The witch' fully embraces and embodies tropes of horror that most movies can only claim to dabble in: accusations of witchcraft, creepy behavior from children, hallucinations belying more horrid circumstances, exposure to Satanist worship, and more. Many movies play in this space, and surely do it well, but none immediately come to mind that actualize these ideas of the horror genre so concretely. Even still - the narrative is truly only part of the appeal here. A great deal of labor and love went into crafting a picture as period-accurate as it could be. From the meticulous construction of the family's domicile to the weave of their clothing, from the purposeful isolation of the setting to the lighting in each scene - writer and director Robert Eggers is to be applauded for overseeing a production so heavily detailed, to the extent that I again find myself unable to name an immediate comparison. A rarity in the horror genre, above all. Furthermore - it's one thing to hold a casting call in England to bolster authenticity, but the accents and manner of speaking of the early 17th century are a far cry from speech readily recognizable almost 400 years later. There's no shame in turning on subtitles here, as devotion to historical accuracy extends so completely to even the script that the dialogue can sometimes be difficult to discern without them. The cast is outstanding as they bring this tale to life, with even the grammar of another era playing heavily into their roles. All perform admirably, but very special mention must be made of Ralph Ineson, portraying the deeply religious and stubborn father William - and Anya Taylor-Joy, in the part of the bewildered, put-upon teenage protagonist, Thomasin. 'The witch' marked only the film debut of Taylor-Joy, and one would hope that she has many great things coming to her, because she is phenomenal. There's something to be said for the way these characters are presented to us. We readily sympathize with Thomasin, a young girl who is trying to define herself while suffering the scorn of her parents in the circumstances they find themselves in. We sympathize less immediately with the twins that torment their older sister, or with the strict father whose stubbornness and religious devotion upholds an imposing moral view that would essentially demand the damnation of anyone watching the film. Yet even as we identify most with Thomasin, as events escalate and tragedy and hardship befall the family, it's difficult not to still feel crestfallen with each portent they suffer. All of this only makes the ending even more tremendous. The conclusion of 'The witch' is hands down one of my favorite endings to any movie I've seen, matched only by John Carpenter's 'The thing' (though there are many runners-up). The way the ending conveys its atmosphere, the way it toys with the suspense that's been building, and the very denouement of the narrative all mesh into a genuinely perfect capstone for such an incredible film. 'The witch' isn't for everyone, not by a longshot. Between the blood and gore, general violence, nudity, and overall themes, someone who doesn't enjoy horror films isn't likely to find favor here, either. Yet the movie is so very carefully, lovingly made, in every possible way, whether one is dissecting the production, the screenplay, the acting, or the narrative generally. Despite belonging squarely in the horror genre, the content here is so well crafted that I feel obligated to recommend 'The witch' to all possible viewers.

The viewers can debate all day what was going on, but it is a genuine horror film, all because the director takes you back to the 17th century, a time where religious beliefs, were the glue that held families together.

This story, The Witch, knocked me out with it's incredible depth of historical and cultural accuracy, the earnest and believable characters, and the extraordinary belief system that they held on to as a psychic buffer in the face of such risk and courage. The director wisely chose relatively unknown actors to give the story an almost documentary subtext. But the actors were all sublimely believable and wonderful to observe. I worry that the way the movie is promoted as horror, witchcraft and possession will keep some away from experiencing this masterful creation. I'd simply characterize the film differently: A psychological thriller based on how the people of the time would interpret what's happening around them in the world. A true New England folktale, as it's tag line properly declares. The Witch is the best depiction of the early Puritan culture and challenges I've ever seen.

It would be impossible to talk about this film without acknowledging how well-budgeted it is. Eggers fully utilized his merely 4 million dollar budget to create an environment that truly feels set in the 17th century, with sets and costumes that are tangible, it does not feel like a low budget independent production for a second, plus it's incredible that it is his directorial debut. I absolutely love films that have to do with biblical themes and ideas, whether literally as they do here, or metaphorically and thematically. Eggers uses this setting to explore heavy themes of myth, faith, sin, disparity, isolation, desperation, and temptation. Great, tight, and unknown cast, everyone brought forth the necessary emotions that raised the tensions to a maximum by the end if it. Anya is especially great, perfectly capturing the feelings of disparity and fear. Horror is one of the those genres that can clearly show if there is a talent behind the camera, what choices directors make, how they approach their characters, and how the let the story unfold are vital aspects of what makes a worthwhile horror film. My favorite type of horror is this, films that look to create horror and terror in terms of concepts, environment, and thoughts, instead of just doing creepy visuals or jump scares. Eggers places you right with the family, you are as confused as they are, and what raised my rating my a half-point is the scene before the last, where it flips the entirety of how you were perceiving the film, and proves that Eggers successfully created enough illusion and confusion to make you doubt every surrounding, much like the characters themselves. A haunting scene, perfectly executed. No doubt, there are weaknesses, I don't expect most people to thoroughly be able to enjoy it. The story can feel a bit thin before it ends, feeling like it is going nowhere and without reason, some scenes early on drag and can be very slow. Also, it was a brave choice to set the dialogue entirely in old English, but after a couple of minutes you get used to the way they talk. Not a huge fan of typical, commercial, easy horror films, and this is definitely not one of them, a haunting experience that is carefully directed by a skilled director and carried by a compelling cast.",452,2,2,False

The Witch is not a movie for just anyone, it is not a quick horror movie or random jumpscares, it establishes itself as the narrative of the sad fate of a poor family as they are harassed by the evil powers of an outside witch. The film is filmed in a beautiful way, creating fantastic images that get stuck in our minds, but above all, full of symbolism and icons that present us with constant subconscious ideas to build the story they are trying to give. The performances are fascinating and make us see the real panic within the characters, even the performances of children are quite solid. The direction is fantastic, the scenes are dark, medieval and cold, giving a strong feeling of desolation. With a fantastic script, it makes us see through the eyes of the poor victims of this story. The Witch is a strong film, full of very incredible and spooky images, concentrates mainly on a very strong subject which is witchcraft and the powers of hell, teaching us the horrors that these entail, however, in a magical way and yet realistic, raw and sincere, without over-explained fantasies or effects. And it doesn't need explanation, that's what this movie is about, to face the horrors of powers that go beyond our understanding, our power and our mental health. Probably one of my favorite horror movies, a perfect movie for those seeking the ''special touch'' in the over-saturated genre of terror. Fascinating.

imdb_the_witch_hellmant_20160224,The Witch,IMDb,Hellmant,2016-02-24,9,I can understand why the average (unintellectual) viewer wouldn't like it.,"'THE WITCH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Critically acclaimed indie horror flick, from debut feature filmmaker Robert Eggers. It tells the story of a deeply devout Christian family, living in the wilderness (of 1630s New England), that are terrorized by a witch (and other evil forces). The movie stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie and Harvey Scrimshaw. It was made on a budget of just $3.5 million, and received rave reviews from critics (but poor reviews from theater audiences). I enjoyed it quite a bit. William (Ineson), and his family, leave the New England plantation they're staying at (in 1630), and head out to the edge of the wilderness, to start life over there. William and his wife Katherine (Dickie) have their fifth child together, named Samuel, but he immediately goes missing. Katherine blames her oldest daughter, Thomasin (Taylor-Joy), for the baby's disappearance; since she was the one watching over him at the time. More mysterious, and very creepy, things keep happening, as the family continues to turn on each other; while always trying to stay true to their faith. The movie is very purposefully slow-paced, and it works. It's always building towards something, and always digging under the viewer's skin. What Eggers does, with such a limited budget, is extremely impressive; and the cast is all great as well. The movie is very creepy, and horrifying, while never giving the viewer any cheap thrills; it's horror done right! It also has some great social commentary, on how being deeply religious can do a lot of psychological harm; to individuals and families (the Satanic Temple even enthusiastically endorsed this movie). Being raised catholic, I'm always fascinated by (well done) religious themed movies (like this). I can understand why the average (unintellectual) viewer wouldn't like it, but everyone else should be blown away!

The craftsmanship is beyond impressive. Every shot could have been an art photograph. All of the sets and costumes and props were so painstakingly period accurate that the world of this film felt viscerally real. The oppressive tone never lifted for the entire run time so that you leave the theater still feeling a bit weird. The Witch reminds me strongly of ""The Others"". Much of the creepiness was drawn from the set and the location. The pacing is similar. Both have super small casts and center the action around child actors. There's very little blood and gore. If you hated ""The Others"" and thought it was boring, then ""The Witch"" is not for you. It's not the typical Hollywood horror ""scare-a-minute"" CGI romp. There's no break in the tension for a comedic relief. It goes to a very dark place right from the start and never shifts that tone. The dialogue can be difficult to follow. It's much more similar to a Shakespearean play than standard issue Period Piece English. I could understand them with some effort, and it made the world of the movie feel that much more real, but some might be turned off by it, especially since the film is so dialogue-heavy.

This one's an unsettling, slow-building horror masterstroke, that delivers some thrills, but is overall a work of pure treatment. 'The Witch' isn't all about scares & spooks, but a tale that grabs you & throws shivers down your spine, even without a single cheap scare. 'The Witch' Synopsis: A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession. 'The Witch' is an exercise in fright. Believe me, after the All-Time Blockbuster The Conjuring, 'The Witch' is another film of the 2010's that does the horror genre right. Eggers's Screenplay moves on an intentionally slow-pace, only to build & build to an unforgettable culmination. You watch the ill-fated family being torn apart from the evil & although heartbreaking, the narrative remains engrossing. Eggers's Direction relies on treatment & he has aced it here. He treats every moment with a sense of paranoia & unpredictably, adding all the more force to the goings-on.

imdb_the_witch_johntequila_20160313,The Witch,IMDb,JohnTequila,2016-03-13,9,Not your run of the mill horror film.,"I've not seen a film like this in decades. A throwback to a CGI-less era where special effects were minimal, the story well written and performances weren't phoned in for the paycheck. This film doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or loud music to trick the audience into scaring. In fact it relies mainly on tension and the paranoia that eventually overwhelms this New England story. I sat in a theatre in the afternoon with about 30 people. A group left 20 minutes before the story unravelled to a satisfying conclusion (their loss). The performances here are all spectacular, the cast made their roles appear utterly believable. Extra credit is due to the promising young actress Anya Taylor-Joy who stands out above a stellar cast. During the showing there no screams or gasps, just positive comments when the credits rolled. Already this film has found an audience, but I think it's the sort of film to grow ever popular over the next decade or so, possibly even studied. If you like your horrors dripping in guts, gore and profanity, then stay away. This is for fans of the old school horror films, reminiscent of the 70's horror classics.",198,3,6,False

imdb_the_witch_bobhartshorn_20160228,The Witch,IMDb,bobhartshorn,2016-02-28,10,The Bare Witch Project,"I approached this particular witch with caution. At first glance it appeared to be sharing DNA similar to that spooned from the same misfiring cauldron as two of my least favourite sub-genre outings of the past 15 years: M Night Shymalan's The Village and Ben Wheatley's A Field In England. The Buzz generated from early reviews & trailers promised the visual aesthetics of the former and theatrical bombastic lingo of the latter and I braced myself for another hyperbolic disappointment. But I needn't have worried, as writer/director Robert Eggers debut effort delivers full on its promise with a slow burning historical tale of external evil manipulating internalised religious fervour to its ultimate sticky end. The story involves a puritan family of seven ousted from the safety of their colony into a life of corn-crunching hardship in the fertile land of New England's past. But deep in the forest lurks an unspeakably malevolent force that wastes no time instigating a plan of destruction for its unsuspecting neighbours, and it isn't too long before finger pointing accusations of witchcraft begin and the ship of dread sets sail toward its unknowable, terrifying destination... With more than a passing nod to lurid 70's classic Blood On Satan's Claw, Eggers' wicked 17th Century yarn is alarmingly brought to life by his informed ear for the period dialect and the remarkable DP work of his cameraman Janin Blaschke, whose lighting skills drain just enough colour from the landscape to make you believe we're right slap-back bang in the middle of pre-creature comforts 1630. There's no shirking from the harsh day-to- day realities & tensions of these new/olde' puritans existence, but Eggers' screenplay never loses focus on their humanity as a real living, loving family unit either. As the dogmatic hubris of ingrained faith begins to tear them apart from within, the dynamics of the story stubbornly refuses to make snide, self-righteous judgements at their expense, so we always care about their survival even when it looks like things are heading to the point of no return. Any whiff of archaic restraints imploding on the usage of Eggers' authentic dialogue is expertly staved off by a first-rate cast who deliver it with unforced conviction. Ralph Inesen and Kate Dickie as parents William and Katherine (respectively) are very fine indeed, but it's their brethren of offspring that steal the show with Harvey Scrimshaw's Caleb and star player Anya Taylor-Joy as Thomasin making the biggest splash via two of the most original and, not to mention, rudest sexual awakenings ever committed to a horror film. And yes, The Witch is very much a horror film. Brooding atmosphere and disquieting menace take precedence over the urge to indulge the usual tired genre tropes, and the more conventionally minded patron seeking a roller-coaster broomstick ride might be put off by Eggers' steady, deliberate pacing. But when it's ready to get its hands dirty, out come the teeth and claws to reward your patience, not least by landing a jump scare I guarantee you will not see coming, but boy, will you feel it! This one isn't called The Witch for nothing. Eggers' draws everything to a close via an orgasmic flash of perfectly timed delirium that, intentional or otherwise, hits a key visual beat from Logan's Run. The reference points don't stop there either as the eerier aspects of the iconic soundtracks for 2001 and The Shining are gleefully aped by composer Mark Korven's score. His music enhances the outlandish finale to such a spine tingling degree, you almost feel as though you've snuck a peek behind the magic curtain to witness one of the world's best kept secrets. Voices of dissent have called out this ending as a step too far. But for me it's further proof of the movies balls and insurance against a branding from the dreaded 'Psychological Thriller' iron too. The Witch is lean, mean and when it chooses to be, damn right nasty. By stepping back in time to the darkness of our past, Eggers' has sneaked the genre creeping and cackling into the 21st century with an entry to make you think twice about picnicking in the woods anytime soon. And to that, I raise a glass of bloody goat's milk. Cheers Phillip!",708,3,6,False

A devout Christian family find themselves banished by the elders of their local community, on account of their father William's (Ralph Ineson) puritanical, uncompromising religious ways, into the wilderness. They set up a home in the forest, and live their lives strictly in accordance with the teachings of the Bible. But then, a mysterious curse seems to befall them, where their crops fail and the infant child of the family disappears into thin air. The family find their dynamics closing in on each other, with accusations flying around, culminating in daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) being accused of practising witchcraft. Of all the genres, in recent times, horror is probably a strong contender for the one that's become the most stale and stagnant, a field that's become over loaded with remakes or original work that's highly derivative of other works that's gone before, and it's all become pretty samey and interchangeable. And so it's refreshing, at least, that feature length debut director Robert Eggers has delivered something like The Witch, a period horror piece that takes us back to the times of Ye Olde England, and drowns us in dialogue that recreates to a tee the spoken dialect of the time, a move that will wrap up and captivate many, and will sadly make it impenetrable for just as many others. If the dialogue and text is something the average viewer might struggle to get their head around, one thing that will manage to appeal to horror aficionados of all ranges is the beautiful, perfectly creepy and unsettling sense of atmosphere, with the dense, barren forest and the thick, glimmering mist used to beautifully haunting, spooky effect, complimented by a soundtrack that jeeps and jars at just the right times for maximum effect. In the lead role, Ineson's gravelly Yorkshire drawl lends his spoken dialogue an added air of vitality. The climax sacrifices solving the mystery of the missing child for something more startling and ambiguous. In an age where the average horror flick seems to think frequent jump scares, excessive gore, young teen stars with questionable acting skills being chased and a whiny grunge soundtrack playing over the end credits is enough, it's certainly a breath of fresh air for something like The Witch to come along, and receive a lot of the acclaim it has. And deservedly so, if only so much of the historical recreation wouldn't have proved so overwhelming to so many. ****",426,3,6,False

So these are my quick thoughts. The Witch is a masterpiece. It's what true horror is all about, it has a fantastic story alongside amazing acting. the film is accompanied with a brilliant brooding atmosphere, that is filled with absolute dread, that seeps into your very bones. This for me is the best Horror film in the last twenty years. It's far beyond the offerings of today's 'Horror' the Blumhouse type jump scare, poorly edited assembly line of crap films. The biggest problem with this film, is the audience, people tend to go into this film not understanding what type of film to expect. Most people I know thought it was going to be a Conjuring type film. It's so much more then that, this is the type of horror that belongs in the 1970s. Robert Eggers had full creative control to do what he wanted. You just don't get that sort of freedom today, and despite it being his debut feature he absolutely knocked it out of the park. The Witch is a far cry from the usual copy and paste, play it safe jump scare horror, which in my opinion isn't at all scary. This film reminded me of Horror classics like Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now and even Ken Russell's The Devils. Like those classics this is true horror that gets under your skin and stays there.

I saw ""The VVitch'' back in early March and I thought it was decent, but I didn't understand what all the fuss was all about. Yeah, it looked nice and it had a chilling atmosphere but that's the only thing I got from it. Well, to be fair, I think I was the only one that I liked this movie compared to my friends and family, as they thought the movie was terrible. I liked the movie but I thought it was kind of slow, I was a bit confused at times and the movie didn't stick with me after it was done. If I was reviewing this back in March, I would probably give this movie a 3/5. But after re-watching the film, I actually liked it even more and there was a lot of things that I can't believe I missed on my first viewing. I don't know how to explain it, but I had this uncomfortable feeling from watching this that I never experience the first time. This is a horror movie that exceeds in film making, it's freaky score and it's gloomy atmosphere that really made this film a true horror. This is a great psychological horror film that can really get under the your skin. I started to notice little details that really made this movie freaking scary when you understand the meaning of it. This doesn't have any stupid jump scars that deflates tension or just any horror movie tropes that we've seen million times already, but that's nowhere to be seen in the ''The VVitch''. THANK GOODNESS! Oh and the cinematography is this movie is just flawless.

Political upheaval, town and family rivalries, religious disagreements, constant fear of Indian attacks, and some individuals' psychological and medical conditions created a perfect New England storm that exploded into what history calls the Salem Witch Trials. Based on unquestioned belief in the Bible, these colonists believed in the literal existence of witches and demons. Stemming from a lack of scientific knowledge, the Puritans also ascribed many natural occurrences to God or the Devil, depending on the prevailing opinions in their society. And, finally, the lack of separation of church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that their government wrote and executed laws (and sometimes executed their people) based on their religious principles. The result of all this was a mass hysteria which occupied the colony's governmental apparatus and legal system for over a year and led to the killing of 20 accused witches. Now, having said all that, I have to tell you that ""The Witch"" (R, 1:33) is not about the Salem Witch Trials. However, taking place in the same general area 32 years before the witchcraft hysteria in and around Salem Village, all the same elements play out in the life of one Puritan family. William Nolastname (Ralph Ineson) is an extremely pious man, so pious that the leaders of Massachusetts Bay invite him to take his family and leave. (This is kind of like ISIS breaking away from Al Qaeda for not being radical enough.) William happily packs up a horse-drawn cart and takes his wife, Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), and son, Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), the younger twins, Jonas and Mercy (Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger) and baby Samuel even further out into the wilderness. They establish a homestead in the shadow of a deep, dark forest, but, despite their fervent prayers, things aren't going quite as well for them as they would've hoped. Life is tough in colonial America and it's even tougher when you're a day's ride away from anyone else. William's crops fail and the hunting ain't so good either. Then, baby Samuel disappears. One moment he's enjoying watching Thomasin playing peek-a-boo with him and the next, he's just gone. The family assumes he was taken away by a wolf, but the audience knows that the reality is even more frightening. As the family members venture into those forbidding woods looking for answers (and food), things go from bad to worse. Caleb disappears, family members reveal uncomfortable secrets to each other and as their stresses and insecurities build, serious accusations of witchcraft are tossed around. ""The Witch"" is a stylistically inventive cautionary tale, but is lacking in basic entertainment value. The characters speak in Old English (think: King James Version of the Bible) and with antiquated British accents. This makes the dialog simultaneously interesting and hard to decipher (although it does get easier as the movie progresses). The acting is outstanding which, when combined with the small setting and even smaller cast, gives a realistic, even voyeuristic feel to the action. The plot, however, is intentionally un-realistic. First time feature film writer-director Robert Eggers has based the dialogue on actual official records and personal journals of the time period, and his story, on popular folklore and superstitions of the day. The result is a film that's original, but convoluted, and has open-ended plot points that call to mind a more European style of filmmaking which many Americans find frustrating. With a terrific cast and original (or at least, unusual) tone and style, along with great educational value (in understanding how something like the Salem Witch Trials could have happened) and relevant lessons as they relate to the dangers of religious extremism in the modern world, ""The Witch"" is just a little too overwrought and unsatisfying for me to call it ""entertaining"" and recommend it.

Sadly I don't think that sort of old style speaking is going to appeal to the mass of people who wanted to see a horror films, but I do think that it will get them talking. This is a real treat of a film that should be watched. It is not a psychological horror flick, but rather a scary and yet neat look into the ideas of the Salem Witch Trails that had once happened and brought fear into many people of that era. It brings in the use of magic and witchcraft in a pretty new and different way. It is a film that works on all levels to make the reaction that the directors and writers want us to feel.

Acting, cinematography, musical score, costumes, locations, and all the technical stuff is a 10/10. This is a masterpiece from a technical standpoint. Where The Witch might fall short for some people is tone. It is incredibly and relentlessly intense, and bleak. It's a heavy, dark movie. Granted, there probably wasn't much to be happy about in colonial America in the 1600s, but don't expect a ray of sunshine to peek through the clouds at the end. The movie did not sell its soul, and at least I can feel good about that. There's no CGI, kickpunching, forced comedy, or anything like that. This is as pure of a horror drama as I've ever seen. I read some complaints about the pace, but that was not a problem for me. As with all the other technical aspects, The Witch felt perfectly timed. Some people may have been frustrated when the feel-good sine-wave didn't progress upwards at any point, but just because they didn't like what was happening doesn't mean nothing was.

This is exactly how one moves the protagonist about a rich and robust plot disporting through a prevalent terror yet using the directing as a sort of spectral narrative in whose fiendish features, mobilize and galvanize the garrison for an all out assault on both phenomena and phenomenal classic reality.

It is compact yet eerily spacious. It has more than enough to make us ponder, then later reflect. Perhaps in the offing, posterity might hark-back and use this masterpiece to add the missing piece to the plight of our human puzzle, to effect change from the paternal quagmire our forefathers were presented with, dispatch with the hoax and forthwith call to the arms of science with a dash of the savage thusly spare us more wasted time, whereupon we are henceforth cast out of the darkest of centuries and hurled headlong into a polar contra-distinction so incredible, so fantastic, so irreprehensibly, inextricably sound it will make the nonce but a sad and petty prospect whose superstitious tenets bring only more discord and disharmony as a unified humane whole, with which to disobey would but surely shake the very foundation of sanity; conversely, we would all brainlessly stumble forth and crumble such to revert back to genuflecting at another more pernicious, more malicious tabernacle.

She actually comes across as the most saintly character up until the denouement. In the meticulously crafted dialogue of first-generation American pilgrims one becomes immersed in the wierd mindscape of 17th century Puritans, where there's an unflinching belief in the supernatural - be it heavenly or hellish... Somehow the horror seemed just so much more genuine here than amidst the usual comic stumbling fiends that make up the stock of the tired genre.. Anyway I loved it from start to finish, and felt such a transgressive kick, a liberated feeling becoming involved in a vicarious way with the goings on. One witnesses in subtle symbolism and audacious moments a bit of everything from murder to incest, suppressed greed & vanity, obsession in bucketloads, pubertal lust, love mingled with hate, hopes for salvation meeting fire & brimstone, to name a few. And it was all so much more pointed and realistic in the austere, sprititalised and just plain paranoid setting that the director so painstakingly creates. This is far too clever and too serious to be pidgeon-holed as 'horror'. It's more of a psychological thriller with buckets of blood and bible-talk.

imdb_the_witch_doubleoscar_20160219,The Witch,IMDb,DoubleOscar,2016-02-19,8,Psychological Horror Meets Family Period Piece.,"The Witch has been receiving a lot of buzz recently from horror fans and Sundance Film Festival attendees. Writer/Director Roboert Eggers even won the Best Director award at the festival. So does it live up to what people are saying? Well yes, but you have to know what you're getting in to. Knowing that this is a smaller indie film from Sundance and that it isn't going to be your run of the mill, make-a- quick- buck horror movie there is a lot of great stuff here. This film combines two things that I am not the biggest fan, period pieces and horror, and, surprisingly, make them work. in his first film, Eggers does a fantastic job and building and sustaining tension. The atmosphere of the film never lets up making for suspense that really gets under the skin in moments where it really counts. Furthermore, the actors were just as equally great as the direction, at first, the older dialect was hard to follow and didn't feel very natural. But after about ten minutes, the language flows better and every thing becomes very believable. Going on with the believability, everything in the landscape and surroundings felt as thought it fit the time period. The film just pulls you into the time period where you fell the struggles as the family does. There was a point where I had to look around the theater to make sure that I was indeed not in Old England. The one thing that might be off-putting to some will be that the story isn't exactly about a witch versus a family. The story focuses much more on the family aspect as we see every family member deal with grief in their own ways as they sink deeper and deeper a psychological trance. There aren't as many straight up ""scares"" as one might hope, but there no doubt be times that make you jump and make you gut wrench. The family struggle is the fuel that drives the story forward and it makes for some great dramatic acting from adult and child actors alike. As for problems, there are a few, but none to detract from the tension and drama that the film builds. The film is very gray and bleak, and at some points, it can be a little overwhelming at times, where you wish the color palette would liven up. To continue, there was a point where I thought the mother character was a little one- note, but I just assumed that it was her way of dealing with grief since she is obviously the one that gets hits the hardest in family problems. The ending can be polarizing to some, I wish there was a even a little more ambiguity, but the way Eggers decided to end is sufficient enough. Lastly, a note must be made about the music and cinematography, both add to the film wonderfully and enthrall the viewer into whatever Eggers wants them to see. Overall, The Witch is a very good horror film, certainly a brilliant start for Robert Eggers and easily a mark or two above the average horror film that is released nowadays. The closest thing I can compare this film to would be The Shining. So, just know what kind of film you are getting in to and you won't leave disappointed.

imdb_the_witch_lw_08854_20231226,The Witch,IMDb,LW-08854,2023-12-26,9,The best horror movie in the last 20 years.,"A very smart slow paced horror film. The historical setting was very well done. This is a film you can watch a few times and in each viewing find something new and interesting. The Blu Ray is clean and clear, the film looks very good for a low budget horror. It was shot digitally and has a nice smooth look. The camera work is very assured and the film is well edited and flows naturally. It also features real animals thankfully not CGI ones, practical effects I would say, great lighting when it's needed. In fact it looks as though there's a lot of natural lighting, both in the outdoors, the moonlight, or candle lit interiors which manage to bring a little colour and warmth to some scenes. The cast was very small but all did very well with what they were given. The film doesn't make any of the characters too likeable actually but that helps with some of the realism. The title I would say is a bit misleading, the film has very little to do with the witch, she's in it for about 35 seconds all in all. The script is really good, you have a small cast so get to spend lots of time with them and to know and understand their dynamic as a group. Things which happen later on are nicely foreshadowed earlier such as the oldest daughter cruelly joking about going out at night and dancing naked with the devil which in the end she basically does. Equally the earlier scenes involving the goat hint at the violence to come. The low light and night shots are very well handled, the picture never becomes noisy. Equally there's no awful day for night attempt either, things actually look like they do at night, with just a bit of moonlight for lighting. The story appears to be set in the 17th or early 18th century and the script nicely utilises some old English, the props, costumes, casting all perfectly sell the period, we don't get some annoying modern comedian in one of the roles or a racially diverse cast playing the same family or anything terrible like that. Old the actors do really well in this film with what they are given, the actress playing the mother is probably the best actually, and also the most unlikeable character too. The film focuses heavily on religion, less so on the love and hope aspect of Christianity but in this case on the sins and corruption of mankind. The devil when he does appear wears black, is tall, wears a black hat and appears to have a black moustache. He speaks in a seductive yet strong whisper, he's able to tempt and seduce. It's a very creepy portrayal. The film somehow manages to make everyday animals scary, hares, birds and goats all seem threatening and sinister. The landscape is largely colourless and the family find themselves struck down by grief, hunger, sleep deprivation, this all causes them to start to turn on each other. This family conflict is really more interesting than the witch in the end, though there is some man v nature conflict in there too. The family live a largely humourless, puritanical life, it's little wonder the children are so troubled. The eldest boy is starting to become interested in his elder sisters body. The film avoids any glamour at all, the two parents look especially thin, lean, grubby and weather beaten. This is a film without loud jump scares, it's a million miles from the over the top hysterical loud horror movies like the Conjuring, Insidious or Paranormal Activity. Much more interestingly there's a thread of paranoia running through it, just like many great horror films like Rosemary's baby or the Shining. Some of the religious are also worth diving into. Man's nature is described as corrupt, wicked, selfish and destructive, it's hard to argue with any of that. However the eldest son cannot help but wonder what sins his new born baby brother could have committed? How could he be born a sinner? The poster mirrors the scene we get at the end of the film of the eldest daughter stepping out naked into the woods, seduced by the devil. The presence of the witch in the film is sinister, many misdeeds are attributed to her but it's more the psychological horror and tension which make this film so good.",738,2,4,False

They're far removed from their nearest community, all alone on their farm. Hard-working, religious and fervent in their world views. So what would happen if they started fearing that the Devil himself had infected one of their own? The film is the feature directional debut of Robert Eggers, who's worked in theater before this one, mainly as a production designer. And that definitely shows. The attention to detail in this film is astonishing. Everything from the location to the set designs to the costumes is about as period accurate as possible. Even the dialogue and the accents utilized by the actors is straight from 1630s Plymouth Colony. The only way to make this more accurate would be to invent a time machine and actually film in the 1600s. As for the horror aspect of the story, it works very well. The film is in no hurry and doesn't rely on cheap jump scares to get you to sit on the edge of your seat. Rather it relies on atmosphere and good character building. Its characters are fearful, frail and flawed. And when the pressure is put on them, they turn on one another. If jump scares are being shanked with a knife, then this film would be the slow agony of a screw press. And when the violence inevitably comes, it's all the more horrifying because you've been waiting for it for so long. Easily one of the best horror films I've seen in years.

It made me what to write this. Indeed, I suppose it is a movie for ""cinephiles"" - but I don't see that as praise and it made me really consider the term cinephile. I have seen thousands of movies. I'm part of a movie group that has been running for years and each week we rotate a movie pick and watch it. I have taken film classes in university and learned how to study film like any good ""cinephile"". I like to analyze movies like any good ""cinephile"". I can admire strong direction, unique filmography, and appreciate difficult shots like say a room has a lot of mirrors and there's no visible crew and camera - like any good ""cinephile"". Where apparently myself and other ""cinephiles"" differ is that a true ""cinephile"" must always praise boring period piece movies. I don't know what it is exactly. Unlike other ""cinephiles"" I hold the opinion that the absolute worst thing a movie can be is boring. I have seen Battleship Potemkin with a live orchestra playing, and I've also gone to live screenings of Rocky Horror Picture Show. I know what one the ""cinephile"" will say was an enriching cultural experience - but what one do you think was more fun? Why must that been the only metric films are judged on? Why can't a movie being a good time be an admirable quality? Like every good film student of yore I had to watch my share of the classics and I always felt crazy. La Dolce Vita? I wanted to fall asleep. Jean Luc Godard? I saw it as meandering pretentious art pieces. On the other hand while Neil Breen has made some of the most objectively terrible movies of the last decade I can't deny turning on one of his movies with some friends and just laughing ourselves sick is a night I'm going to remember more than analyzing Yasujiro Ozu's ""The Flavor of Green Tea over Rice"" and trying to reflect on it's representation of pre-war Japanese family structure. So, as it comes to the VVitch - this is most certainly a movie for the critics. A movie for the staunches of cinephiles. A movie for those who hate fun. A movie for those who hate horror. A movie for those who feel authentic period costumes and hard to listen to old timey English are what film is *supposed* to be. The movie is well made, well shot, the language is (as far as I know) authentic and I'm sure there's lots of allegory and imagery you're supposed to love to analyze. Unfortunately it commits what is, to me, the gravest of movie sins. One which all cultural reflection, meaning, symbolism, imagery and Oscar bait period piece themes can't make up for - the only ""horror"" in this movie is in that it's horrifically boring.",491,5,5,False
imdb_the_witch_oberrated_20160420,The Witch,IMDb,Oberrated,2016-04-20,8,Slowly terrifying and disturbing,"To put it simply, Robert Eggers delivers a terrorizing horror in the form of 'The Witch'.

The constant questioning of what is happening leaves the audience uneasy and when this film finally starts to pick up, it consistently bludgeons the audience with eerie terror.

imdb_the_witch_wondrousmoose_20170828,The Witch,IMDb,WondrousMoose,2017-08-28,9,NULL,"The Witch, director Robert Eggers' debut film, is an atmospherically terrifying tale of manipulation and paranoia. 2016 was a pretty solid year for horror films, with major releases like Don't Breathe and 10 Cloverfield Lane faring well with audiences and critics. While many releases were sequels, prequels, or lazy reboots, there were several that ended up as genuinely scary films. The Witch, an indie gem distributed by A24 (Ex Machina, Swiss Army Man), is one of these, and many people simply haven't heard of it. I'm not going to hide how much I like this movie. It fascinates me. I'm generally not much of a horror fan, but at the end of the day, a good movie is just a good movie. The story takes place in 16th-century New England and follows a Puritan family of seven who have recently been banished from a plantation settlement. Distressed, they set out blindly into the wild, in hopes of building a new home for themselves. When a witch from the nearby forest abducts their youngest, the mother of the family completely snaps, and the rest must try to survive in the untamed wilderness as their relationships and minds deteriorate further. As they grow more paranoid and even accuse the oldest daughter of witchcraft, they threaten to destroy themselves. The pacing of this film has remained its most contentious quality among audiences since its release. The slow and deliberate pacing starkly contrasts the exciting scare-fests that more casual horror fans expect today. Instead, this movie is oppressively tense, refusing to break the mood that it builds at almost any point. What the pacing and atmosphere of this film are able to create is utterly horrifying. The witch herself is introduced to us in just about the most repulsive way possible, and from that point onward, the film essentially builds as an hour-and-a-half nightmare. Without the relief provided by unearned jump scares, the tension from these scenes builds mercilessly and doesn't let up. I also have to be sure to mention the acting in this film. Each member of the family, which serves as most of the cast of the movie, is thoroughly believable, from the parents to the young twins. While children in movies are with rare exceptions painfully hard to watch, both the child and adult actors in The Witch give convincing performances. This is a film featuring many relative unknowns who can remind us that a film doesn't have to be helmed by A-list stars to be effective. In particular, lead actress Anya Taylor-Joy delivered a well-rounded and convincingly emotional performance; I'm excited to see where her career takes her over the next several years. The characters' mutual descent into madness is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece The Shining. Visually, they are both exquisitely constructed, though instead of the bright symmetry of the older film, The Witch presents itself visually in a sharp grayness of frank poverty, uncomfortable character closeups, and shrieking nature shots. Honestly, you'll end up afraid of just about everyone and everything in the movie from the paranoia that the visuals help produce and the chilling score of period instruments and melismatic chanting help to fully bring out. There's a terribly vulnerable nakedness to the characters' condition in their small homestead. Protected from the wilderness by a shabby split rail fence, the members of this family appear so cold and fragile. While the titular witch is the villain behind what happens to and between this family, the land around them is so oppressively ambivalent that it become a villain all its own. The film is a surprisingly spiritual film. Christian iconography is common in western horror films, but The Witch is able to meaningfully incorporate otherwise cliché themes and imagery into its narrative. The characters are deeply religious, often praying and quoting scripture, though a good deal of drama and tension derives from how horribly they treat each other in the worst times. By rejecting the joy and forgiveness that is central to the Christian faith, this devout family allows for a very real and present evil to tear them apart. Each of these characters is fast to instruct the others to pray for forgiveness because they refuse to offer it to each other, and in the end, they all suffer horribly. Beyond its strengths as a horror film, The Witch is an undeniable accomplishment of period filmmaking. From the characters' way of life and view of the world to their immediately apparent costumes and speech, most elements of this film are placed and held believably within seventeenth century America. The dialog could have sounded contrived and artificial, and given the inexperience of many of the actors involved, I am impressed by how well it turned out. Director Robert Eggers heavily researched speech, farming, religious attitudes, and more from the time period portrayed in order to authentically transport us there; his efforts paid off. I particularly appreciate his transformation of dialog produced by twentieth century actors into everyday speech of seventeenth century English expats. To my knowledge, the accent that the characters use in the film is accurate to what the English language sounded like at that time. The words used are also largely accurate; Eggers went as far as to incorporate records of actual alleged possessions and bewitchings from around that period in time into scenes in the film. The ease with which these lines fit the rest of the film is a testament to his efforts. It's a shame that because of this movie's pacing and relatively understated scares I can't recommend it to many horror enthusiasts, but that hardly takes away from its artistic quality. The Witch is a testament to what can be accomplished in a film conceived and driven by a passionate and skilled mind. It is proof that there is more to the horror genre today whatever Blumhouse Productions is pumping out this month. Like the best horror films, it exists where fear and helplessness meet and holds you there with it until the screen has gone black.",1007,2,4,False

It is about as subjective as comedy, perhaps even more so. Both comedy and horror are ruled by emotions that vary widely from person to person. For example, most critics hate Adam Sandler comedies (with a few exceptions) but audiences still receive them. Why? Because they find it funny. The same can be said for horror. Paranormal Activity has gone stale for most people, but there are still a lot of people that watch it. Why? Because they think it's scary. There are going to be people that like the new Ghostbusters movie, and people that are going to like the new 'The Ring' reboot that is coming out this year (seriously). The Witch, like 'It Follows' and 'The Babadook' before it, follows a trend of critically acclaimed, slow paced psychological horror movies that perhaps unintentionally market themselves as epic monster pieces that are full of scares. The Witch isn't full of scares. The concepts behind it are scary, but you won't jump in your seat. I didn't at least. The Witch is a mellow piece that builds tension over time. The cinematography is beautiful, the writing is moody and matches the time period, the music is amazing (probably my favourite part) and the young leading actress Anya Taylor-Joy was incredible in her role as Thomasin.

I generally don't like horror movies because I get annoyed by the standard Hollywood formula. It's refreshing to see something that is disturbingly all kinds of wrong. The Witch is not a jump-out-of-your-seat-in-terror-brown-your-pants horror film but what makes this film especially unnerving is that it feels real and plausible. Indeed, this story is inspired by a series of historical accounts. The story begins with a family in the new frontier of the US in the 1630s getting banished from their township and their attempts to create a new life by the edge of a forest. Nothing else need be said. Just watch and squirm and be prepared to look away. There are some truly unsettling moments. I can tolerate all sorts of weird and freaky stuff with my movie watching habits, but the Witch had me rattled and I've not quite figured out why or how. The entire cast was amazing - the guy from the Office who plays Chris the sleazeball, that creepy Lysa Arryn from Game of Thrones, all four children, led by striking newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy who was impressive as Thomasin, the eldest sibling. The eerie soundtrack and the use of shadows in the cinematography were also very effective. The manner in which this was filmed places the viewers in the midst of the family's struggles making us helpless voyeurs and at times maybe complicit... I'll stop right here. This is exactly how horror films should be done. It is one of the best horror films I've seen in a loooooong time. Very promising feature debut by director Robert Eggers. Here's looking forward to see how he translates Nosferatu as his new project. Really impressive. Go see it.",284,2,4,False

The movie presents an engaging slow burn tale of estrangement, betrayal and exile which takes on many forms throughout the story and does a phenomenal job of building mood, atmosphere and tension as well as some well-crafted suspense and frightening set pieces resulting in a unique and enthralling viewing experience that will stay with you long after it's over. The Plot = Set in New England during the 1630's, A Puritan family finds themselves banished from their community over a religious dispute. They build a farm near a large, secluded forest, only to be preyed upon by an evil force in the woods. This is the kind of movie that reminds me of why I love the horror genre so much, a deeply thought-provoking and visually stunning masterpiece that works on just about every level with incredible performances, authentic set pieces and the harsh reality of the time period really pulls you in and while the movie doesn't quite play out as a traditional mainstream horror flick, it does an excellent job of building atmospheric tension and plenty of unnerving dread and presents a story filled with drama, paranoia, melancholy and fear. The direction by Robert Eggers is simply outstanding as his style fully immerses you into the period setting with powerful storytelling and subtle techniques to present an original viewing experience and one the very best horror movies to come out from the 2010's. The performances here are extraordinary with Anya Taylor Joy who steals the show as Thomasin the eldest and rebellious daughter with her captivating screen presence and excellent performance. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie each delivers incredible and formidable performances as the parents as their heartbreaking descent into helplessness is harrowing to watch. Harvey Scrimshaw gives a remarkable performance as the eldest son Caleb.

Each shot in the film is meticulously crafted, speaking volumes without the need for words. The depiction of witchcraft is both beautiful and frightening, striking a perfect balance that intrigues and unnerves in equal measure. The soundtrack complements the visuals flawlessly, enhancing the eerie and unsettling ambiance of the film. This combination of striking imagery and haunting audio creates an atmosphere that is both mesmerizing and disconcerting, drawing the viewer deeper into the film's dark world. The performances are outstanding, with each actor delivering a strong and compelling portrayal of their character. Their performances add depth to the already rich narrative, making the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere even more palpable. What sets ""The Witch"" apart is its storytelling approach, which heavily relies on the interpretation of the viewer. The narrative is crafted in a way that encourages personal reflection and analysis, leaving much to the imagination and interpretation of the audience. While the film may not be conventionally scary, it has an undeniable psychological heaviness. Certain scenes are particularly impactful, resonating with a profound intensity that can be unsettling, especially for those in a low mood. In conclusion, The Witch is a remarkable horror film characterized by its powerful imagery, eerie soundtrack, and exceptional tension.

The dialogue is particularly excellent, too. Everyone on the cast gives a terrific performance, shown perfectly by that final scene with them all together onscreen. Harvey Scrimshaw is super convincing in the aforementioned, I was almost questioning if they had got an adult actor and morphed him into Caleb, such was his high performance. Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson are class in that scene too, one of the most unsettling moments in this is as their characters convulse on the floor - that sorta thing with kids always creeps me out. I've gone too far into my review to not note Anya Taylor-Joy, who is quality from beginning to end. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie merit props as well. I mentioned in my recent review of (the good) 'Nosferatu' that I was unsure how this one was going to fare in my personal ranking of this director's work, given the stark contrast with my thoughts on 'The Lighthouse' (4/10) and 'The Northman' (9/10). In actuality, this falls a notch below the latter; not far off the same rating, fwiw.

The movie really portraits the said era. After the best Hereditary film, this comes after. Anya Taylor-Joy really is the best at horror films from her young age. She starts the film with being innocent and naive until she became omnipotent and that's a good character development since she is ""The Witch"". I knew the Queen's Gambit girl is the best at horror films. The movie is totally creepy and will leave you having goosebumps until the end. It totally depicts a girl going through maturity and comprehends that she'll eventually experience such chaos in her family. A really good movie to originate a folktale. The only criticism I personally have is how they talk, I sometimes cannot understand their conversation or is it just my perception that is low and besides it's from New England.

Even the subtle score is well put together and not over the time, not brewing up to cheap jump scares or slashing moments. I myself am a fan of horror, however most horror movies often leave me feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied. For those who feel this way on an even more dissatisfied level, this movie may be the one that brings the genre of Horror to a level playing field for your interests. Watch The Witch, but with expectations of it being a movie.

""The Witch"" is a painstaking recreation of Puritan life in New England. The lifestyle is mimicked. The clothes are period-accurate. The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It's as if Mel Gibson decided to update ""The Passion of the Christ"" by 1700 years. As mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until... okay, no spoilers. See the movie. This is a dark and effective movie. I can't remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to ""get"" me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won't lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster's ""Hereditary,"" if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end. That being said, the film isn't perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it's perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It's kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are. ""The Witch"" is quite an achievement and I'm glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking ""The Lighthouse.""

Eggers cast perfectly, the location and setting are astonishingly eerie and the isolation felt is so real. The twins make me want to reconsider my stance on not hitting children, Taylor-Joy's performance is subtle but great, Dickie is very similar to her character in Game of Thrones, but it works. The boy is second best imo but the absolute show stealer for me is Ralph Ineson. 10/10 Haunting sound design, specific colour grading and authentic dialogue give this movie a unique style which is hard to find in this genre. Some clunky editing in the middle and tad bit over the top -ness reduce it to an 8 out of 10 for me. But it's still great!

His work proves to be exceptional, even after following into this grim subject of witchcraft.

Everything from the Christian slurs, to the naked chants in the forest, and hateful curses coming from the mouths of children. Although I am not someone of this practice, the portrayal of the craft felt well executed throughout the film. At least in terms of what I've always imagined these types of things to be like, which in layman's terms is a deep rooted spiritual warfare for the believers of God and non-believers of God. The destruction of the nuclear family, the infamous black goat, the mysterious loom of the bonfire, and the remote forestry all combined for the perfect magical horror recipe.

Horror cinema is overloaded with average or bad productions, and that's why I believe we have every reason to congratulate a work that manages to stand out and stand out from the crowd for the best reasons. I'm not going to make the mistake that many professional critics have made and indulge in grandiloquent praise that calls this film the horror masterpiece of the decade, or one of the scariest films of their lifetimes. I won't do that because that would be a huge exaggeration and unfair to several other quality horror films. But yes, this is a very, very well made film, and worth every penny of the movie ticket. I will definitely recommend it to friends. The action takes place in 17th century New England, among the English communities of radical Protestant religion, the so-called Puritans. The film invites us to follow a Puritan family who are excluded from their community due to religious differences, and who are forced to live on the edge of civilization, on a small isolated farm on the edge of the forest. For whatever reason, they did not feel any fear of the native Amerindians who inhabited those regions, nor did they think about them when terrible things began to happen to them and the family's baby was kidnapped. To the ultra-religious and fearful minds of these people, it could not be more evident that there is a diabolical witch, a servant of Satan, disturbing their peaceful and most Christian existence. And of course, to the audience's delight, they couldn't have been more right! Since they don't know who she is, suspicions start right inside the house and a kind of ""cabin fever"" develops. How will it all end? You better see! Let's start with the not so good part, which for me comes down to the written script. The story is good and is set in an attractive historical period where religious hysteria and witch hunts were real. That is, if we traveled back in time and could go to that region we would find people with similar attitudes and thoughts. This is very good and writer/director Robert Eggers shows that he did his homework and read some books about the time and the mindset of those people. But, as the people say, the Devil is in the details: even though they were ostracized, did they have to move so far away from the settlement that they would expose themselves to danger? Why are there almost no other characters? Anyway, I can handle these little script details just fine. On a technical level, the film is very solid and presents us with very well-done cinematography, an excellent filming job that makes the most of the candlelight, the yellowish tone they give off, and the shadows they leave in the environment. The soundtrack and sound effects do a lot for the dark and tense atmosphere that the film begins to build from the beginning. There is not a moment where I felt that these elements were intrusive or omitted. The suspense and dramatic tension are magnificently modeled throughout the action, so much so that we don't even feel time passing: we are caught up in what we are seeing, and we want to see how it will end. The cast contributes enormously to the quality of the film, giving us superb dramatic performances, full of tension and authenticity. We cannot fail to say that Anya Taylor-Joy, who quickly establishes herself as an unequivocal protagonist, deserves all the applause she has received for this work, which consolidates the ascending career she has had over the last few years. Ralph Ineson is also not far behind and is probably the one who receives the most complex and difficult character to play. Kate Dickie, meanwhile, takes her character on a gradual descent into hysterical madness as she watches her life fall apart piece by piece. Harvey Scrimshaw and Ellie Grainger are very helpful with the work they do and cannot be overlooked because of their age.",690,1,1,False

They make a rough homestead in the wilderness, where their infant son disappears in the literal wink of an eye while under the care of eldest daughter Thomasin. . .catch the connotations of her name? A lot of creepy stuff follows. While the plot line's a bit too hazy to be truly satisfying, ""The Witch"" is better and more original than most recent horror efforts. If more solid folklore and theology were brought in, this film might have been really great. It also could have worked better if the supernatural were left out altogether and everything was kept in the characters' guilt-ridden heads—or at least implied to be. I got a little restless during the draggy middle portions which, luckily, don't last long. That being said, those who want lots of action and constant surprises probably won't dig ""The Witch."" This film is also quite bleak, so the easily dejected should also perhaps avoid it. An interesting blend of supernatural and psychological horror. Keeps you guessing who's really evil--the parents, the children, neither, or both? Is the rabbit just a rabbit, the goats just goats? Is the silver cup really just an heirloom? Is it deliberate witchcraft, unwitting obsession or possession, or is the family just stir-crazy, overworked, and over-worried about how they'll survive the upcoming winter? Some of the middle details, along with the turnabout at the end, help to answer these questions, though they don't entirely--and who wants them to? The children's attempts at fun and games—or are they more than that?— add a great deal. It's easy to see why young kids would be bored out of their minds and willing to do just about anything for entertainment in these surroundings. Obviously fairly low budget, but the directors made good use of what they had to work with. A small cast and narrow use of settings, but good visuals, costume design, and dialogue. The latter is easy enough to understand if you know your basic thee-thou-hithers, etc. Still, it's hard to follow everything in a few places due to the heavy accents and muttering, so subtitles may be necessary—I saw this in the theater, where there were none. While ""The Witch"" avoids stereotyping the Puritan characters as completely austere and humorless, it conveys the setting pretty convincingly. Good acting by all the main cast, but especially those who play the four children.",421,2,5,False

Now they are in dire straits by themselves on their dry little farm. One day the baby son suddenly vanishes basically right in front of the teen daughter's (Thomasin's) eyes. We see that a witch puts him to sinister use. The father thinks that a wolf took the baby. We learn that the father isn't particularly good at anything but chopping wood and being pious. That forces the early teen son to man-up to to speak. For some reason they don't seem to be able to plant anything and have to make do with three goats, two white ones and a black one. The mother doesn't also do much but complain to god and dream of going back to England. At some point the father sold a silver cup that belonged to the mother's father, something that he doesn't disclose to her. Their two strange toddlers are a little creepy and talk to the black goat and even sing its praises! One day in jest, Thomasin threatens the unruly kids pretending to be a witch. One night the son decides to leave at night with the horse and dog to find food to avoid the family's decision to sell Thomasin away to work for someone else. Thomasin comes along. The dog off course ends up dead, the horse runs away, and the kid is seduced by a beautiful woman. Later he appears at the farm naked and ill. He's somewhat possessed and this pushes the family to the limit. The kids accuse Thomasin of being a witch, which the mother quickly believes, Thomasin throws the father's uselessness in his face. The day after the kids are forced to spend the night with the goats, things have a bloody unraveling. And we learn why the movie is called ""The Witch."" The Witch is a lovely atmospheric even claustrophobic little movie written and directed with subdued confidence and charm. It sets a great tone with the accented overly pious language but the obsession the God and scripture does get tiring after a while. It's supposed to be an independent movie but it eagerly follows the standard Hollywood political agenda. The father's incompetence is just too unrealistic, so is the overly democratic household. Things improve markedly from the monotony once things unravel and the two final revelations regarding the goat and the witch raise this movie several notches in quality and leave one with a very favorable impression of the movie as a whole. The Witch is original in a very good way.",436,2,6,False

What an asshole he must have been. Therefore he leaves with his entire family of wife and three children and a babe - plus several goats - to make a life of his own in an isolated cabin. When children start dying in mysterious circumstances, the family starts to break apart, while accusations and fear of witchcraft fly uncontrolled. I loved this part of the story and I liked that the pace is slow and uncomfortable. Nothing really happens other than see backward people do backward things and then suffering for it, but the acting is good, the pain is transmitted well and you kind of understand how they get to where they're getting. The part that I didn't like is that with all the setup, they had to introduce a few scenes with ""the witch"", which was absolutely superfluous. If they would have shown no witches and kept the viewer guessing, the impact would have been greater, I believe. Also, with a supernatural cause for everything the writer/director denies the viewer the choice of believing in God's salvation, in the possibility of controlling the situation by ordinary folk or of any hope for the ending. It's just like ""Bambi meets Godzilla"", the outcome is pretty much set. Add a slow pace to this and I am sure people will be upset of how nothing happens and when it does is inconsequential. Other than this one - important - detail, I liked the movie. Therefore I urge you to tweak the story in your heads when you watch the film. Consider all witchy things hallucinations of the people involved. Then you will find some meaning in the whole thing.

The buildup in circumstances that lead to the level of intensity at the very end is perfect. The prayer scene is tremendous and everything in the last 20 minutes is a 10/10.

Weird can be okay. I found this movie to be weird, unique, disturbing, interesting, and creepy. Not scary, more creepy. The good parts about this movie was the scenery, the acting, the uniqueness (no clichés in *this* film), and the time period (mid 1600's). The absolute worst part of this film was that I couldn't understand most of it. I didn't understand most (and that means over 50%) of the sentences. I wanted subtitles. I'm reading from others that the dialogue was a wee bit hard to understand. Ya' THINK? That's kind of like saying a cannon fired on a ship gives a few splinters. Anyway, I understood about 20% of the dialogue. The second worst thing was that it didn't tie things together. SPOILER ALERT (kind of): I waited for the end to tell me who the witch really was, what did she do, was the teenage girl insane (that would have been a better ending in my opinion), why did the mother hallucinate, was anyone really evil, what happened to Caleb in the cave, what happened to the twins, etc. etc. The third worst element was the over dramatized scenes for effect -- he gets gutted, she gets strangled, he upchucks a bloody apple, she gets the knife, he gets shot in the eye (but later, no blood!), she gets hen-pecked, the boy has a 1950 haircut... my WORD! And the ending was just silly to me. A talking goat? At that point, I wondered if the film was realistic and someone lost their mind. Nope. Sheer silly fantasy. This may be my failing in that I was expecting realism from a fantastical film. But the dark mood, the cinematography, and the imagery haunted me. The acting was superb.

Those who do not understand the story have little understanding of the history and truths the people lived with as there is no corresponding belief system today. Attempting to interpret the storyline under today's sociologically contemporary belief system will not work. The belief in witches and how people became them is historically consistent in this piece and is a fascinating study of how people believed it happened, especially in it's relationship to a major religion. Watching this film requires you to place yourself under this alternative world view, understanding the minute of the daily impact that religion placed in everyday actions that individuals undertook. If you are capable of doing so, you will find this a fascinating and very rewarding watch. If you can not, you won't be able to follow the story line or understand the story elements.

imdb_the_witch_quinimdb_20161202,The Witch,IMDb,quinimdb,2016-12-02,9,The Witch,"""The Witch"" thrives on the suggestion of evil, which is truly the scariest evil of all. The film is based in 1630s New England during the early colonization of America. The characters are God-fearing and they are dedicated to their faith. It is what drove them to America, and it is implied that it is what got them banished from their town just at the start of the movie. The family moves out to the country to start their new home in isolation just outside the woods, and soon their infant child suddenly disappears. Of course, this is a result of the witch living in the woods, as revealed to us near the start of the film during an incredibly disturbing scene, complete with very unsettling music. The music in this film contributes greatly to its success; it's frantic, upsetting, chaotic, and grating, and it works perfectly to compliment the atmosphere of the film. As far as the setting goes, there is a striking attention to detail. The wardrobe, architecture, performances, and especially the dialogue, all done in old English, contribute to an incredibly accurate depiction that sucks the viewer right into that time period. This film heavily relies on its child actors for the majority of it, so thank God each and every one of them managed to have a convincing, realistic performance. The characters' dedication to their religion is ultimately what isolates each one, and causes their ultimate acceptance of evil. Since they follow all of these strict rules without question, it leads each of them to harbor repressed thoughts and hide their actions from each other, leading to a growing paranoia between all of them. It is a disturbing portrait of humanities' inclination towards evil. The cinematography and the dark, muted color palette evokes a genuine sense of dread. Subtlety is the key here. Something as simple as a shot being held for a little too long can put a viewer on edge. The tall trees in the forest loom over the family at every moment and the dense collection of trees and branches in the shots within the forest give a sense of being trapped and overwhelmed. The tension that is built in this film results from direction so confident you would never guess this is a debut. Horror movies need a real, universal fear in order to work, and in ""The Witch"" it is the fear that we are all naturally inclined to evil, and there is nothing we can do about it.",418,1,2,False

The creation of atmosphere be it with the camera work, editing, effects, and score are a great success in giving you the whole experience of being back in the 1630's, facing a cruel existence, for some god knows why reason.

I took a gamble with The Witch and boy oh boy I was not disappointed. The combination of the authentic feel of colonial New England, the devout God fearing family, the foreboding woods, the bone chilling musical score, the brief glimpses of the actual witch and chaos she creates, all of it works so perfectly together. Now I would not recommend this movie to everyone. The tension and horror slowly builds for over an hour until the final act so if you are impatient and want a beginning to end nonstop horror ride then you will be disappointed. The movie starts out quickly with the abduction of the baby Samuel (along with a VERY disturbing scene that shows you the extreme evil the family is facing) but then kind of dials back as the family dismisses his disappearance as an act of a wolf. Even though it is pretty slow in the middle the cinematographic shots and music keep you gripping your armrests throughout the whole movie wondering when the next time something sinister might happen. I wasn't 100% happy with the ending.

'The Witch' (stylized as The VVitch) is more of a fable - almost a surreal catechism from the 17th century. It is not, of course, something that judders your bones and causes you to jump out of your seat. Rather, the atmosphere puts us back in the New England of the Puritans. Would you question God and if you do, well you have pledged your allegiance to the devil is the circumstance in which we find ourselves. Robert Eggers remarks that the film was made to be a Puritans nightmare, something directly out of the mind of a 17th century New England-er. And such a nightmare, given its time would have to be purely inherited. We are treated to how this nightmare is inherited as well, with a father-son sequence that isn't about bees and birds but more about how humans are born and bred in sin and redemption is a distant dream. Never are we allowed to distance ourselves from the fact that the family who's life we are deposited into do not exactly have a happy life of living off their produce. William, the head of the family,banished from the plantation where he lived and farmed with his then pregnant wife, sons and daughters builds a modest farm at the edge of the woods. The rest of the story is designed to be and works as a beautiful bed time horror story. Before we get to the actors, I would be remiss if I did not mention that Robert Eggers is first and foremost a production designer, someone who believes in and I quote 'if I got asked for dirty green curtains, I gave them the best dirty green curtains they'd get'. The proof of course is the clawing natural light photography, faithful production design, costumes and imagery. His sense of design extends and is shared by his team in researching New England Puritan history and most of the dialogue helps in the time travel we are subject to. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke and composer Mark Korven lend beautifully atmospheric imagery and background score so much so that at a certain point in the tension, silence has already etched a melody in our minds. The cast in the meanwhile almost seem as committed to the movie as the Vatican was to killing off women of wisdom in the middle ages. Ralph Ineson, Anya Taylor-Joy, Kate Dickie, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson comprise the entire cast save a couple of supporting actors. Not only does keeping a small circle of actors the main cast pay off in terms of keeping us engrossed to their fate, it also shows us the darkness that descends on them. The actors are almost fiercely committed to the movie, mouthing their 'thou''s and 'thy''s with such casual conviction that we are sucked into the soul of their plight. Anya and Kate Dickie in particular, and it should come as no surprise, are brilliant in their characters. Without going into too many details, 'The VVitch' if it were necessary to be described in comparison would be in the same coven as 'The Shining'. Moody, atmospheric, generative and degenerative, the images flicker across the retinas like out of a crystal ball that has told you the future, murky and realistic at the same time. When a cold dreary sky is offset by a thick brownish grey wood, when the wind blows across a reinforced barn roof and howls down the chimney, when the rising full moon is blurred by the cast of a shadowy fear - 'The Witch' wins you over in the chills it sends down your spine. It is not to be missed - a classic concocted in genius fashion in the masterful hands of Robert Eggers, Jarin Blaschke and Mark Korven.",649,1,2,False

The Witch does not resort to jump scares to put the ""scary"" in ""scary movie"". Instead, The Witch relies on a dark atmosphere, haunting imagery, the subject of religion and the consequences of sinning to pull emotions from the darkest depths of your soul. The Witch starts as a seventeenth century family is thrown from their homes, leaving no choice but to make homestead distant from all civilization. When their newborn baby vanishes, madness begins to pin the family against each other all while something lurks in the very woods surrounding them. This movie does just about everything right when it comes to a great horror film. Ominous visuals with very tense camera-work involving long shots and quick cuts helping the extremely unsettling aesthetic created. Impressive and convincing acting from all of the cast, especially all the children who actually out perform the adults involved. Mark Korven delivers a spectacularly chilling soundtrack which adds to the already eerie setting presented. The plot itself is like a scary tale you are told as a child around a campfire, and keeps you up that night leaving you thinking whether if something like this could really happen. The Witch is certainly a distinct movie that might introduce you to elements you have never seen before. When it comes to horror films, The Witch has definitely taken the cake for best of 2016 yet, and I don't really see any upcoming major threats.",262,1,2,False

The best accident for a long, long time! Registered here just to review it. Everything about this movie resonated with my horror sensibilities. The cast is most excellent, the background and surroundings are pleasantly realistic, and the tension is built up masterfully. The writer has clearly read historical witch trial proceedings, and reflects the contents of those grim documents in this work. I don't have much love for most modern horror films. Too often, they play on cheap scare tactics such as sudden loud noises, sudden loud cuts, sudden loud louts screaming in high-pitched voices and running around headlessly, getting gored by knife-wielding maniacs. They over-explain everything, and leave no room for mystery and genuine horror that comes from the unexplainable. The Witch takes a completely different approach. It's a brave move, but I daresay the gamble paid off: this movie is a classic in the making. It's a slow-burner, but there is a sufficient amount of interesting things going on at all times.

The Witch focuses on the psychological decline of a family - how quickly it can happen and how it effects the dynamic of the household. The horror aspect comes from the creepiness which surrounds this film. It's a throwback to old Hitchcock films, and more recently, ""Goodnight Mommy,"" in that it makes you question what is real and what is not. The acting is superb. Every actor in this film will make you uneasy at one time or another, which, of course, is the point! The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 is because I didn't love the ending. Well, not really the ending itself, just how it played out on screen. But aside from that I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.

Despite my inability to articulate why this was a great film, I also knew it wouldn't be an enjoyable film to continue to watch over and over again, so dark, so foreboding, so serious .... I, unsurprisingly, was wrong! Upon each additional re-watch I have continued to thoroughly enjoy this film and my tiny little ex-film student mind has even started to realise why. The Witch, or for the pretentious like myself The VVitch, is a modern horror truly crafted with passion, creativity and attention for detail. Everything is elevated to next level film making here, be it acting, cinematography, pace, I could go on, proving once again Horror is a vital genre breeding filmmakers that deserve to be recognised as artists. If you were to ask me if its scary, after first watching I'd probably say 'yeh but i dunno why', experiencing it again allows for a few layers of subtle execution to osmose through my thick skull. The gore is used precisely and only when necessary, for maximum shock, the atmospheric building of terror is perfect enough not to rely on jump scares (the few they use are cracking though) and the darkly comic tension they create in this family dynamic is sumptuous. The comedy is in there and for me it is vital in the entertainment factor, that has disproved my initial thought RE re-watching, the ability to wryly smile at the darkness ironically punishing this family looking to get closer to God, will grow into laughs. If the film has a flaw it is that clearly the ending was bungled, in the last scene the townsfolk should have gone in search of the family only to find remnants of there bodies and the occult, one line should then have been uttered: ""Must be the season of the Witch!""

I watched this film about a month ago now, and I'm still not entirely sure what to make of it. I read one critic describe this film as 'a horror film for cinephiles, not horror fans', and I can honestly say that that describes this film perfectly. The film looks amazing, has great performances, and effortlessly builds atmosphere and dread with each passing frame. It is hopelessly bleak and nihilistic, and you are not entirely sure if there really are dark forces at play here or if the family are just descending into delerium due to lack of nutrition. The thing is though, I'm a horror fan... and I like my horror films to be, you know... horror? Like that critic said, this is a horror film for non-horror fans (as oxymoronic as that is), and even though this film builds and builds its atmosphere, there is never any really big payoff that I personally felt was needed. You basically just watch a family go mad for 90 minutes, and... I dunno, I just felt I needed a bit... more? Is there a witch? Is the eldest daughter a witch? Can the twins talk to the devil, who is actually a goat called black Phillip? What actually happened to the baby? So many questions... but the leaving it up to personal interpretation felt a bit uninspired, at least to me. People who love their arty films will probably lap this up, and it no doubt will give film schools much to discuss, but personally I felt a bit underwhelmed. It wasn't at all what I expected, and I get that that's on me... but nevertheless like I said I'm conflicted on how I feel about it. A good film that's just not for me?

When their baby, Sam, is taken from their parish an unruly force takes over the family that begins to slowly tear them apart. The film is directed by Robert Eggers and stars Kate Dickie, Anya-Taylor Joy, and Ralph Ineson. It's been a long while since watching a film that is genuinely unsettling but to also find it refreshing at the same time. This time around we're talking about 'The Witch' and having viewed the trailer this past month I was eagerly looking forward to seeing it. To describe this movie is nothing but unsettling and the credit goes out to the director who was able to hone in the suspense not knowing where the movie would go next. Now I have to warn everyone in saying that this isn't your typical horror film with big budget effects and cheap jump scares forced down your throats. Instead you are treated to a time piece that sets the tone with events that took place in old folklore and a time where witchcraft was believed to exist. So for some viewers this may not rub off so well and could turn them away if your not knowing what to expect. With that said, this is not one to be overlooked.

imdb_the_witch_schroeder_gustavo_20160322,The Witch,IMDb,schroeder-gustavo,2016-03-22,9,Disturbing,"The Witch is Robert Eggers' directorial debut, he also wrote the film. It tells the story of a family that is banned from New England and moves into a farm in the middle of nowhere in the 17th century. There, they start to experience weird things as there may or may not be a witch causing trouble nearby. I'll just start off by saying I really liked The Witch, but I think a lot of people will be disappointed in the movie because it's really not a conventional horror film. In all honesty, parts of the first act kind of bored me. There were parts in the beginning of the film where the movie does slow down a lot and I actually nearly fell asleep. But that's where I realized this movie was more about the characters than the actual witch. It's a film about this struggling religious family and how they react to this certain type of situation. Even if the first act was pretty slow and I didn't know where it was all going, nearing the second act of the film, all of the third act and especially the ending was amazing. It is a movie filled with tension, every scene is filled with it. You feel like something could happen at any moment. There are many things in the movie that just blew me away: the directing is brilliant, the cinematography is beautiful and surprisingly, the acting was spectacular, especially from Anya- Taylor Joy who plays Thomasin, the main character. Her performance is brilliant and I really hope to see her in more films in the future. The score is haunting and really fits the movie's tone and the editing is pretty unconventional and I loved it. The editing lets you in at take a peek at the horrific things happening, but it never gives away too much information and it really is a prime example that the things you don't see are more terrifying than the things you do see. One of the things I really liked about the movie was that it felt pretty real and accurate. It's a very good depiction of the 17th century I believe and one thing in there that was great was the dialogue. Everyone speaks in old English. You know, like ""How art thou this morning?"" And things like that made the film feel real. The dialogue is kind of hard to follow but I can't really say that's a negative because it's built into the fabric of the film and how it wants to be more realistic. The last act and the ending is some of the best horror I have seen in years, maybe even ever. It's so gripping and tense and I just felt dirty and disturbed after watching it. It got under my skin in the best way, I thought the Witch was terrifying. However, like I said I think most mainstream movie-goers will be disappointed in the film, because there are no unnecessary jump scares and the movie moves pretty slowly. Besides from a few boring parts, I loved the Witch. It's a brilliantly crafted film, tonally perfect and scary as hell, too. One other thing I really liked is that this movie features some blood and gore at parts but it was never like violence for the sake of violence.

More often than not, I leave disappointed. That was not the case with this indie epic horror film that exudes with Kubrickesque qualities, most eloquently in the cinematography & music. I heard haunting hymns from ""The Shining"" while my partner heard ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". In every single frame, a composition by which a photography class could be taught. The lighting was exceptional and imbibed the overall mood of dread that amassed throughout an expertly-paced 90-minute runtime. Truly disturbing situations arise. Though tastefully done, the imagery is sure to sustain long after leaving the theater. I could feel the anxiety from the handful of others in the theater with us. I could not tell if they were impatient by the 10-15 extra seconds that would typically be cut from modern forms of horror or the unsettling images just out of sight but definitely not out of mind. Once the 10 distributor logos cleared the screen (which gave me a deeper appreciation from the get-go the many trials this gem had to traverse in order to craft success), much like my favorite Kubrick picks, my eyes would not dare leave the screen. This dark historical piece, genuinely creepy to the point of traumatizing, actually scary when the time was right, and acted with a maturity void from so many films nowadays, especially child actors. Summarized credit where it is duly-earned, in order of noteworthiness (cast first): Anya Taylor-Joy, Harvey Scrimshaw, Ralph Ineson, Katie Dickie, (& crew) composer Mark Korven, Jarin Blaschke's Oscar-worthy eye for the light, also kudos to the dozen+ producers, including Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potters 1 & 2), and writer/director Robert Eggers.

The story of a farmer family who came across the ocean, but now lives on the edge of the forest after denied permission to build a house in a village. When the newborn baby disappears in a thin air, the family begins to experience the mysterious events. Without a clue about the happenings, the evil force begins to possess them while the unity of the family is tested. Wow, finally a wonderful horror-psychological-thriller. Usually horror films are the worst kind compared with other genres, because most of them overly rely on the sudden sound/noise and gore. But there are many awesome horror films I had liked which were better story than the graphical presentation, like this one. So I love good narration than those try to scare me with make-ups, stunts and sound mixings. It was a limited cast film, sets in a beautiful remote place and the language was awesome that perfectly suits for the horror theme like this. Everyone's performance was brilliant. It is just a one million dollar film and the entire film was shot within a month. The records are not matter when the writing and the direction were top notch. Especially for a first timer it was a remarkable achievement. A simple plot, developed greatly and the suspense was the highlight. Yet viewers expect more explanation, but I'm happy for what it is and it should not go deeper than that which might spoil its unique flavour. Not just horror film fans, everyone should try it if they're capable to handle the slow narration. Finally, like usual, here I won't ask for a sequel, because it'll make an amazing one off film than the dozens of crappy follow ups. 8/10",308,1,3,False

imdb_the_witch_cultfilmfan_20160219,The Witch,IMDb,cultfilmfan,2016-02-19,9,The Witch,"Back in the year 2000, I had the pleasure of seeing the director's cut and re release of The Exorcist on the big screen at my local theatre. This was such a thrill for me as I was not around in 1973 to see the film when it was first released in theatres and now having a chance to see not only one of my favourite horror films, but one of my favourite films of all time on the big screen was an experience that I was to savour and that was a great all around film experience for me. Overall as I mentioned, seeing the film on the big screen in stereo sound and with additional unseen footage was great. I also thought that being able to see and experience the film with a then live audience full of people who perhaps had never seen the film before as well as fans of it probably who even saw it back in the 70's would be a real treat, but unfortunately seeing it with a live audience was one of the drawbacks of the film. All the then teenage viewers who were in the film audience amongst me, were instead of being in fear, or absolutely captivated by the film as they should have been, they were instead laughing and mocking the film as if what they saw on the screen was one of the funniest things they had ever seen. I was completely in disbelief and truly was despairing of this generation of moviegoers, even if I unfortunately fall into that same age group and demographic. I mention this in this review of the new film, The Witch, because the exact same thing happened to me while I was watching this film with a live audience who typically fell in the teenage age bracket as well. People were not only laughing and sneering at the film as if this was the funniest film to come along in quite awhile, but they also mocked it, were squirming in their chairs with boredom and countless times various people of the audience would leave and then come back into the theatre which each time caused the heavy theatre door to make a large slamming sound as they would enter and then exit the theatre and this happened frequently throughout the film. I think in both cases with The Exorcist, and now with The Witch, both films are very good, but the proof shows that they go beyond the typical maturity level of a teenage audience and those who attended my screening. The Witch, is a smart film with sparse and bare settings and backdrops that reminded me of the European films of Bergman, Tarkovsky and even Lars Von Trier's last few films in his depression type trilogy with Antichrist and Melancholia being the main examples. The acting was all by people who were relatively unknown to me as was the director and most of the crew if I have to be honest about it, but their dedication and craft on this film was excellent and this ended up being one of the most effective and interesting horror films of recent years. There certainly were moments in the film that were almost baffling, ludicrous and even hard to understand at times, but I at least was so compelled and interested by what was going on that even the more bizarre aspects of the film were intriguing to me as opposed to being something that bothered me about it. The film is getting rave reviews from critics and for good and appropriate reasons because technically it is one of the best made horror films from an artistic standpoint as well as any serious fan of the genre can tell you how effective and thought provoking this experience was. The people in my theatre like the people almost 16 years ago who laughed and mocked The Exorcist, are from a generation who like their horror films violent and with loud, annoying and sometimes just plain idiotic jump scares and stuff that most of us would just avoid, or roll our eyes at if we saw. Too bad that all these years later that today's teens are still enjoying the same old garbage and are totally aloof to anything of any artistic merit such as the two films in question. With time we will see how these films continue to fair, but I have a suspicion that critics and horror fans will be on my side and these teens will eventually grow up and their past tastes will be left in the dust. Time will certainly tell.",771,1,4,False

They all tend to be quite similar: jump scares, freaky imagery, etc. Well The Witch is not at all like these films. The film is set about 400 years ago in a very religious and puritanical world. A man and his family are banished from a community and set up a small farm on the edge of a forest. Eventually supernatural problems occur... Now don't think that it will be like the other horror films I listed. This film is slower and doesn't really feature anything too out there like spider-walking little girls or red-faced demons. Nonetheless it is quite thrilling for a horror fan who appreciates something different. And I don't think this is too much of a spoiler but this isn't a film where the protagonists can just shout about the power of Christ to make the antagonists run away. So it's refreshing in that way. Technically the film is very well made. The acting is good, the scenery is believable and you really get the feeling that it is historically accurate. I recommend it but do realize that it's a divisive film seemingly; some say its really scary (including Stephen King) and some say its so boring.",228,1,4,False
imdb_the_witch_turfseer_20170221,The Witch,IMDb,Turfseer,2017-02-21,4,NULL,"Convincing tale of Puritan family's paranoia leading to murder ruined by reliance on typical horror film tropes The Witch marks the directorial debut of Roger Eggers, who meticulously researched this tale of a 17th century Puritan family banished from their community due to a disagreement over the interpretation of the New Testament. The characters and dialogue are based on actual court transcripts from the time period as well as folk tales that reflect the supernatural beliefs of the people of that era. The attention to period detail is perhaps the film's greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness. Eggers' protagonists--consisting of parents William and wife Katherine, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas, as well as their daughter, Thomasin (who emerges as the story's antagonist)--feel as though they were delivered directly to the screen via a time machine. The verisimilitude of the characters is that convincing. At the same time, because they speak in the arcane style of old English, dependent on the Bible, you might find it quite difficult understanding the words that are being uttered—unless English subtitles are available on your DVD. The story begins with the family living in a remote, rural area. Thomasin is babysitting Katherine's newborn son, Samuel, who is kidnapped—and we soon learn that a witch snatched Samuel and killed him for his blood (to make a flying ointment). When William takes Caleb hunting, he confesses that he sold Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. Later, when Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of the cup, she implies that not only did she steal the cup but also had something to do with Samuel's disappearance. Meanwhile, the other children claim that the family goat, Black Phillip, has been talking to them. When Caleb decides to go hunting in the forest by himself, Thomasin insists on joining him. Eventually William finds Thomasin but Caleb ends up in the clutches of a witch and when he finally returns to the home, he's dying of a fatal illness. After the young boy's death, the twins and Thomasin accuse one another of being in league with witches and William is forced to lock them all up in the goat's stable. What could have been a nice little story of a 17th century family's paranoia leading to murder, is replaced by a silly folktale about witches being responsible for the carnage that unfolds before us. The sequence of events is as follows: the twins disappear, William finds Thomasin unconscious in the stable with blood on her hands, Black Phillip kills William, Katherine blames Thomasin for William's death and attempts to strangle her, and Thomasin kills her mother in self-defense. Eggers appears to buy the superstitious mumble-jumble of those times when he has Thomasin end up in the forest talking to Black Phillip the goat, who of course is actually Satan. When she signs Satan's ""big book,"" it's the old trope of signing away one's soul to the devil. Alan Scherstuhl, writing in the Village Voice, couldn't have said it better: ""The Witch purports, at times, to confront ignorance and hysteria, but in the end, for horror thrills, Eggers's film sides with the preachers and executioners."" In other words, despite all the impressive research, The Witch is just another dumb horror movie. Despite the earnest performances (especially an intense Anya Taylor-Joy playing the accused Thomasin), once we're force fed all this nonsense about witches and a goat morphing into Satan, all bets are unfortunately off.",577,5,7,False

As the movie opens, we see the husband of the family at trial, due to religious disagreements, and the man and his family (his wife and 4 kids) are forced to leave the plantation and start life anew. Some time (a year?) later, we see the family having built a house and working the land in a far off place. Thomasin, the oldest daughter, goes out near the woods and plays peekaboo with the newest addition to the family, a baby boy. Then after another peekaboo, when she opens her eyes, the baby is gone. She frantically goes looking for the baby in the woods. At this point we are about 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this is the debut film of writer-director Robert Eggers, and what a debut it is! In the opening credits, we see that the movie's full title is actually ""The Witch - A New England Folk Tale"". The movie is billed as a 'horror' film, but if you are expecting a slasher movie or something explicit like The Exorcist, you will surely be disappointed. Think of ""The Witch"" more in terms of the Stanley Kubrick film ""The Shining"", also termed a 'horror' movie but in reality more a psychological family drama. Even though they are completely different movies, the parallels are uncanny: the isolation, the gradual breakdown of the family, and the ultimate insanity of it all. Newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy is sensational as Thomasin, but truth be told, so are Kate Dickie as the mother and Ralph Ineson as the father. BEWARE: the movie is spoken in 17th century English (""thee"", ""thy mother"", etc.) and I must admit that quite a bit of the dialogue flew straight over my head, I just could not grasp it (English not being my native tongue may be a factor, although I have lived in the US for 30+ years--I'd be interested in anyone else's perspective on this). Even with that 'complaint', I found this to be quite an amazing movie, furthermore so considering this was made on a nickel and a dime. ""The Witch"" premiered at the 2015 Sundance Festival and made a huge splash. I've been waiting to see it since. Not sure why it's taken more than a year to finally get a release in theaters, but better late than never I suppose. The screening I saw this at on the Friday evening of the movie's opening weekend was attended okay but not nearly as well as I had anticipated. Couldn't help but notice that a group of about 4-5 people left the theater midway through, and didn't return. I'm afraid that there was a gap between their expectations of this movie and what the movie really is. Yes, it is a 'horror' movie, in the same way that ""The Shining"" is a 'horror' movie, but it is so much more than that. If you are in the mood for an outstanding original tale of one 17th century family's descent into insanity, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.

This film is not your typical jump-scare fest; it's a slow-burn descent into madness that will leave you disturbed and captivated long after the credits roll. Set in 17th-century New England, the film follows a Puritan family exiled from their community and forced to confront the dark forces lurking in the surrounding wilderness. The film masterfully creates a sense of isolation and dread, immersing you in the family's paranoia and the chilling atmosphere of the unknown.

He captures something special, different and unique with this movie. Ralph Ineson's voice is incredible. Masterful cinematography. That shot from the back of the wagon looking out to the pilgrims and Native Americans is so good. Really stands out to me. The eerie and unsettling minimalist soundtrack compliments the movie perfectly. The outfits and props are on point. That's something I always admire about Eggers is how he's able to teleport the audience to a specific place and time while also creating a very memorable atmosphere. A lot of attention to detail. Very striking and disturbing imagery. The sound design is beautifully detailed. You can even hear the creaks from the wood of the house. The lighting is so good with all the candle-lit scenes and natural lighting. They make really good use of darkness as well. It's a slower paced movie that takes its time building a sense of unease and dread through its eerie atmosphere. The scene with the witch lathering herself with blood literally made me sick to my stomach. It's so f'd up. The movie explores themes of religion, faith, womanhood and fear. They shine a light on the religious hysteria that was going on during that time. It also takes a detailed look at what it might've been like to live during those days. All the hardships and harsh living conditions look real tough to deal with. The dad struggles to provide and it was his pride that got the better of him. The twins are creepy, especially the way they seem to know what's really going on. The mom is a neurotic mess, she comes off very annoying at times. The rocky dynamic between the family makes for some interesting drama. Everyone gives a great performance. The boy who plays Caleb did an incredible job. The parents end up being hypocrites.

imdb_the_witch_jayakumarjrain_20250804,The Witch,IMDb,jayakumarjrain,2025-08-04,8,ROBERT EGGERS MASTERPIECE,"The Witch (2015) - Robert Eggers A masterwork of atmospheric horror, The Witch is a slow-burning tale of isolation, fear, and spiritual collapse set in 17th-century New England. After a devout Puritan family is exiled from their community, they settle near an ominous forest. When their infant son mysteriously vanishes, followed by the failure of their crops and eerie occurrences, paranoia infects the family. At the center of this descent is Thomasin, the eldest daughter, played with haunting intensity by Anya Taylor-Joy, whose transition from innocence to something far darker becomes the film's chilling core. Eggers, in his feature debut, demonstrates meticulous attention to historical detail, using period-authentic dialogue and minimalist design to create a world steeped in dread. The horror is not loud or overt but emerges from religious zeal, repression, and the family's crumbling grip on reality. As suspicions mount and tensions rise, the film becomes a meditation on female autonomy in a world ruled by patriarchal fear and superstition. The cinematography is bleak and beautiful-washed-out colors, stark natural lighting, and oppressive silence mirror the psychological suffocation of the characters. Mark Korven's unsettling score only deepens the discomfort. What's most terrifying is not the witch herself, but the unraveling of a family destroyed by their own beliefs and the terror of the unknown. The goat Black Phillip becomes a symbol of creeping evil and liberation alike. The Witch isn't traditional horror-it's an arthouse descent into madness that demands patience and rewards close attention. Its final moments, both shocking and strangely empowering, leave a lingering, provocative aftertaste. Review written by artist jayakumar jrain.",264,0,1,False

imdb_the_witch_elicopperman_20251006,The Witch,IMDb,elicopperman,2025-10-06,8,Folk Horror at its Most Effectively Minimal,"10 years ago, up and coming filmmaker Robert Eggers made his feature-length directorial debut, The Witch. Taking place in 17th century New England, this fairly minimalist folk horror flick sticks out for its authentic portrayal of Early Modern English and its premise of a Puritan family turning against each other due to an evil force lurking beyond them. On top of feeling like a naturalistic recreation of Ye Olde American folklore, The Witch tackles themes of paranoia and independence that are as timely as they come. As members of Thomasin's family disappear or crumble one by one, the ongoing danger of unknown diseases and rare medicinal cures add into them accusing the other of witchcraft or murder, further emphasizing how quickly people back then were to blame others for something unsolvable. As much as witchcraft does play a role within the context of the ongoing horrors shown throughout the film, the era this film depicts was already quite unnerving as is. As the cast is concisely minimal, they play off each other with believably fierce resentment and petrified anger, including Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie. However, then newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy carries the film on her shoulders as Thomasin herself, as she conveys the character's emotional obliviousness with appropriate uncertainty. The film at no point emphasizes whether Thomasin is a target of victim blaming from her family or an actual witch harming said family, making her ongoing turmoil all the more captivating. All the uncertainty shown through the film is so strong and airtight that even a significant goat named Black Phillip running through the farm may or may not be the definitive cause for alarm. Much like a mystery play, The Witch keeps the viewers guessing as to who the real culprit behind the danger actually is, allowing the horror to feel as unsettling as the era it takes place in. Well paced and effectively creepy given the era, Robert Eggers' The Witch still holds up as a uniquely spine tingling folk horror film. Made at a time when the horror genre was garnering fresh renowned praise with up and coming filmmakers at its disposal, it remains a testament to authentic period storytelling in the modern age. While Eggers has gone on to bigger and arguably creepier projects, this film marked a turning point in his career for being one of the new voices in horror filmmaking.",397,0,0,False

But that's about it. There's no horror to it, really, nothing special about it - we're a long way away from 'standard' horror fare, nevermind great offerings like ""hereditary"" that add an arthouse feel to the genre. Anya Taylor-Joy looks completely out of place, wearing foundation, eyeliner and lipstick in a world built to allegedly feel 'realistic' (the actors exchange in 'pseudo old English's', sometimes with clear difficulty). At times, it's so visible it's quite frankly laughable, even in 1080p. The film also suffers from major plot holes: for example, the family seems to remember every word ever said throughout and will imply drastic consequences simple comments made in jest, but ignore evident warning signs, to the point of absurdism. You'll want to scream at your tv in this one. There's also a dreadful lack of symbolism - the ending adds nothing to the film, offers nothing, and is a reflection of nothing.

As I child, I was more frightened of creepy dolls and serial killers (probably the result of a premature viewing of Child's Play); witches just reminded me of Maggie Smith dressed up as Minerva McGonagall. While watching Robert Eggers's The Witch, I was genuinely creeped by witches for the first time in my life. In early 17th century New England a puritanical pilgrim, William, (Ralph Ineson) is at odds with his plantation's church. In an act of religious pride he moves his family outside the plantation's walls and into the unsettled Northeastern wilderness. However, when William's daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), allows the newborn to suddenly vanish, the family begins to descend into chaos. Going into the theater, I was anticipating reviewing The Witch as a genre film, but don't be fooled by the title; Eggers (the film's rookie writer and director) has far loftier aspirations. The script is thematically dense and every element of the film, from the lighting to the camera movement and placement, compliments those themes. The dialogue, too, is, at times, almost impenetrable and undeniably ambitious. Don't expect cheap jump scares or a threadbare plot. This, alone, would keep The Witch firmly entrenched in the realm of pretentious art films, but in Eggers, and his entire team's execution of these ideas, the work is magnificently elevated. It is a tonal masterpiece. From the beginning montage, where we are introduced to the world of the supernatural, to the ending's chillingly satisfying final image, you can see the meticulous calculation that went into the making of this movie. The result is a slow burn that never feels boring, but instead leaves you waiting, in anxious anticipation, for a moment of terrifying climax. Moments like that are why we go out to the movies. There's nothing better than that sense of fulfillment, especially when it's tinged with a lingering psychological thrill. My lone misgiving with the film, though, lays with the acting, Perhaps, in his concentrating on the stunning visuals, Eggers ignored his child actors, who periodically seem lost in the script's archaic diction. The adults are fine, and I was mesmerized by Ineson's gruff, haunting voice, but young Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) are occasionally grating, and distractingly so. Even Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), who nails his important exorcism scene, falls flat on a few of the lower-key scenes. Taylor-Joy is the lone exception. She is mesmerizing throughout, and I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes a breakout star as a result of her work here. Those few hiccups won't ruin the film for a student looking for an interesting, new scary movie to occupy a study break, though, and for cinephiles searching for the next, modern horror classic, The Witch is your ticket.",465,0,2,False

The story is pretty much simple and involves only a few characters but what makes it unique is the believable performances and the time accurate writing. The actors playing the father, the male son and the wife were incredibly good at emoting and reacting to the horrible and disturbing situation they were put in and their performance is what made this movie stand out. Anya Taylor joy wasn't bad. Her accent seemed fake and felt like she was uttering what she memorized but still she did decent but not impressive as her counterparts. The movie is not terrifying in any manner as it's mostly a realistic drama dealing with daily survival but the fantasy elements were what made it tense and gave the place they lived in the chills. The family being unaware of the occultists presence right next to them yielded an unsettling and unpredictable environment where evil can strike at any moment. Their strong devotion to their beliefs slowly start to overshadow their rational world view and they start pointing their fingers at each other for the disturbing deeds of the witches and eventually their paranoia and mistrust opens a chasm in their tie for the monster lurking behind to exploit. I loved the culmination too. It seemed fitting to the build up and the plot. Some scenes seemed unnecessary though as nothing happens and the characters just stare. I know it's for suspenseful reasons but such overly long shots work when there's a payoff at the end. The religious babblings were also a bit too much.

The former is nothing more than an instrument, often exaggerated, and the seventh art has used it to exhaustion, mostly in its cheapest form: the scare-jump. The latter is the product of an intelligent and elaborate use of narrative resources that, in its best examples, refers to the ancient and paradigmatic oral stories in which the imagination of the good speaker stimulated that of his audience in a skillful framework of words, gestures, and brief, accurate, enigmatic silences. Honoring good horror with overwhelming historical precision, hurtful subtleties and dignified graphic sobriety, Robert Eggers reminds us of the ancient, fearful and forgotten truths of witchcraft, relegating the owner of the Blair Woods to the role of a poor, unpleasant old woman. All the elements that the sub-genre can draw on at its roots flow with terrifying naturalness from the first minutes of a story that makes tension its sharpest tool. The dark forest, possession, human sacrifice, the temptation of the flesh, the pact with evil, the blood rite, the cursed animals, the forbidden book as an evil mirror of the other, which does not seem to help at all, parade in their best finery. But if the convincing acts of witchcraft presented with no modesty before our eyes were not enough to hurt sensibilities, the elegant narrator's pen gives us the horror of a ruthless lifestyle, feeding on a fanaticism that refers to the least lucid ways of facing the most fearsome misfortunes. When evil finds no obstacle, prayers are answered by silence and the righteous pay for sinners, the road to the coven is paved with friendly, gentle whispers.",289,0,1,False

Eggers' presentation of the film allows it to have an eerie feel throughout, seeping the horror deep within the soul of the viewer. The exploration of themes such as religion, especially in a time when it was a pivotal standpoint in people's lives, creates a psychological drama for the family the film centers around. Giving each character a perspective on the subject matter produces a riveting and emotional weight to the film.

Rather than delivering scares through jumpscares or terrifying monsters, it builds tension slowly through atmosphere, dialogue, and a cold, grim setting. The 17th-century colonial era feels authentic, amplifying the sense of isolation and fear. The film's muted and dark cinematography enhances the unsettling mood throughout the story. The audience is drawn into a remote forest setting, where a family faces inner pressure and dread driven by their beliefs in the supernatural. Anya Taylor-Joy delivers an outstanding performance as the central character, carrying emotional weight without overacting. Admittedly, the film has a slow pace, which might not appeal to viewers expecting fast, surprise-driven horror. Yet, that deliberate pacing is The Witch's greatest strength. It's not frightening through sudden shocks, but through a sense of quiet danger that lingers from start to finish.

I've heard this film described as Satanic, but this rings true only if you define the Satanic as the intentionally chaotic, as the rejection of any form and order. It acknowledges only the limitation of the body, which is to say death, which is to say the limit of mortal knowledge. The cinematography is magnificent, brilliantly capturing the lighting of the pre-electric world at least as well as did The Revenent. This is true wilderness, and its unknowability as such is thus much more believable on its own terms than was that of the woods of Von Trier's ""Antichrist"", a work, it must be said, to which this film owes much of its forest-as-cruelty imagery. The person who can live with chaos is necessarily a by-product of a society that seeks to avert it, and the only person who can survive in this natural chaos is not inherently ""evil"", they are only thrown into a situation in which their natural strength reveals itself in relation to their peers.

I am a horror nut, I love horror movies of all kinds from old creature features to modern scifi alien movies. But, in order to love them, they have to be in some way.. actually.. good. This movie did not deliver on it's high promises of ""outstanding acting"" and it certainly did not live up to it's hype of being ""the best horror movie in years"" or ""a cinematic masterpiece"". Frankly the thing that kept me from walking out of the theater on this one was the fact that I literally fell asleep. I have never fallen asleep during a movie before, it was a terrible experience. For a moment I thought, maybe I missed some good stuff, but with the reassurance of my friends who watched the movie while i passed out from boredom, I worried a little less about what amazing cinematic marvels i may have missed. Now, I didn't want to go solely on my friend's feelings, perhaps we were the only ones in the theater who disliked it. Well, that too was proved to be.. an incredible experience. With the last... Terrible. Shot of the movie, which was made to be dramatic and horrifying, half of the audience erupted in laughter while the other half, such as myself, sat in awe of what i was watching, in complete disbelief that someone wrote that down in a script and other people went ""this is good."" When the movie switched to credits, the room was taken over by a universally spoken ""okay then."" as people got up to leave. People literally said ""okay then."" in an un-amused, annoyed, and utterly disappointed manner. This is without a doubt one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.

No offence to Catholics, but your sermons are not really known for there zest for life. The end of the movie plays out beyond prediction, as if you can tell the director simply gave up on the film and had to make some kind of conclusion, and it makes about as much sense as wearing a winter coat to the beach in July and about as exciting. ...

imdb_the_witch_sidd_the_movie_slayer_20160221,The Witch,IMDb,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,2016-02-21,9,Damn You Easter Bunny!,"The VVitch is a movie written and directed by Robert Eggers. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, and Harvey Scrimshaw, along with Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson. A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession. The VVitch is a 'horror movie' like no other. It manifests itself inside the viewer creating a genuine feeling of dread and anxiety as it becomes more and more apparent how inescapable the situation truly is. This dread and anxiety is reflected onto the silver screen as the characters understand their predicament slightly later than the audience. Though I did thoroughly enjoy The VVitch, I can definitely a large number of people hate it as everything about it seems so damn impenetrable. This is mainly due to the quaint setting and the fact that this movie isn't a true horror movie or even thriller. What it is, is a rich period piece that finds its depth in its heady yet poignant themes. Writer, Robert Eggers, understands the kind of movie he desires to make and does it with much gusto. He wanted to design a heated family drama under the masquerade of a supernatural thriller. This is no easy task as Eggers makes the active choice to keep the characters in the dark, while feeding the audience provocative twists on the age old story. This works quite well in constructing a tense and morbidly dark atmosphere that succeeds at making the viewer feel helpless with no real reason why. Emphasizing build up instead of cheap results and firm grasps on familial ties, paranoia, extremest mindset, the script of The VVitch is deeply disturbing yet pristine in its construction and subtext. Though tedious for some, and a joy for others, one thing is universal in both parties: the distaste seemingly tidy conclusion. For a movie that packs so much creative bite, an ending that boasts some interesting twist or an open ended yet arguably conclusive was definitely necessary. Eggers decides to go in a different, more definitive, end. This is frustrating since on first glance it seems too simplistic for a movie that is anything but. This is a complete fallacy as the straight forward, strict ending demonstrates the amount of nuance behind the main character in surprising and dour ways. The main character, Thomasin, is brought to life with full autonomy by Anya Taylor-Joy, who as a first time actress, delivered a surprisingly seasoned performance. She is assisted by Ralph Ineson who gives an equally dedicated performance. Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was Harvey Scrimshaw progressively improving performance, that really stole a handful of crucial scenes almost seamlessly. The direction in this movie was also surprisingly as Eggers makes some very smart calls as he uses exaggerated pans, wide shots, and moving shots as he truly brings out the setting while building the atmosphere, however this does drastically slow downs the pace which somewhat works against the progress made. He also uses an abundant compelling amount of imagery resembling fairy tales like Red Riding Hood and the Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, which in turn stimulates childhood fears and subverts them. This is matched by the dreary yet realized cinematography and the ominous score. The VVitch is a Unsettling masterwork of horror cinema that's brilliance is realized by his great ambitions. The VVitch gets an A or a 9/10.",567,0,4,False

Robert Eggers understands that the viewer doesn't need an instruction manual to understand his film and for this reason he contemplates a subtlety and a slowness in his films. In other words, Robert makes movies without anxiety, without that compulsive desire to stimulate the viewer, and this is evident in ""The Witch"" where in a little over 90 minutes we enter an immersive world where we perfectly feel the nebulousness and the eerie character of the environment. And regarding the atmosphere of ""The Witch"", of all the elements of the film, the atmosphere is a highlight, the atmosphere is so well constructed that you really feel the world created by Robert Eggers. Another highlight is the brilliant performance by Anya Taylor-Joy, who manages to be stunning on screen and offers an intensity in the scenes that creates a strong highlight during the experience. Regarding the script and direction by Robert Eggers, the concept of symmetrical direction and transforming the film into a living painting works concomitantly with the beautiful photography by Jarin Blaschke, which makes the film a work of art in each scene. And of course, Robert Eggers' script, despite not being deep, is absolutely functional and, above all, intriguing. Finally, ""The Witch"" is an almost perfect work.

The dramatic music and loud noises in the beginning - I could have been without, especially, since there wasn't much happening yet. They probably wanted to let us know, something is about to happen soon enough. The story is about puritan family in an exile (voluntary), away from other people, due to religious differences. They are however not holier than th... anybody else. As pretty much anybody, who thinks and tries to portray themselves, like they're better than others. They have their fair share of troubles - with honesty, faith, kindness, they deceive each other, blame each other, hurt each other. The land is hostile, the crops are bad, nothing is actually going very well at all. And then, as if that wasn't bad enough...there's this vvitch. Eventually, even the father realises, he should have been a bit more humble and stayed in the settlement. A bit late for that though. The scenery is great, haunting, acting is very good - kudos to those little children, other than having slightly different accents than the older family members - but that's absolutely nitpicking, they did fantastic, especially for this kind of movie. If you're expecting to see a slasher horror, monsters running around all the time, slime and liters of blood gushing everywhere, this is not the film.

imdb_angel_heart_luke_346_20071206,Angel Heart,IMDb,luke-346,2007-12-06,8,Matures with age and grows on audiences and film connoisseurs alike!,"I'm glad I caught this because what was seen by many as a poor film in 1987 can only be seen as great film in 2007. Angel Heart is one of those films that matures with age and grows on audiences and film connoisseurs alike. A psychological horror/thriller is one of the hardest genres for a director to prosper in but if you were to mix in spiritual and religious elements along with a heap of film noir, a touch of romance and a smidgen of jazz then you would set yourself a near impossible task, nevertheless it would be a task in which Alan Parker would succeed. The direction of this film is masterful as Parker engages us through a meticulous atmosphere littered with mysterious allegories, gut rendering paranoia and an unmatched sense of place. This unmatched sense of place is a symptom of his stark imagery and sombre lighting which is played out through an amalgamation of film noir and the focal iconography of 50s and 60s French New Wave (the use of elevators, ceiling fans, staircases etc). For many of these reasons and more Angel Heart is a very influential film and its inspirations can be seen in many of the psychological thrillers/horrors released in the past 20 years, it is thought provoking and at times a lot more disturbing than any of its genre equivalents. The multi-faceted love scene in the film is one such example, it plays very well as it is cleverly interspersed with a host demonic echelons which (given its style and narrative position) I believe to be unparallelled, even in contemporary cinema. Overall Angel Heart is a very well paced and well acted film  although initially I felt that having Mickey Rourke in the lead role was a poor choice (based on his more recent work) but clearly he was at his acting best in his younger days almost Oscar-worthy, Robert De Niro is also on form as is the young Lisa Bonet  but these performances combined with everything else make Angel Heart a film that will stick with you, not as much as Midnight Express or Mississippi Burning (dir. Alan Parker), but enough to make you ponder why this film wasn't so successful upon its initial release and enough to curse why he didn't spend more time dabbling in the psychological/horror genre.",393,75,11,False
imdb_angel_heart_kingm21_20060104,Angel Heart,IMDb,KingM21,2006-01-04,7,A Fallen Angel.,"Harry Angel, a low-rent private detective, has been hired by Louis Cyphre to track down a man with whom he has some sort of contract. The investigation leads Harry from person to person, from New York to New Orleans, through many dark twists and turns. As he goes deeper into the case, he gets pulled into a world of Voodoo, the occult, and murder and finds that he himself is involved somehow. He struggles to find out the truth behind everything going on and when he does, it's quite the revelation for him. It took me several viewings to finally grip Angel Heart. The film is a bit difficult, not in that it's hard to understand the plot but that there are so many details to sort through. You must pay attention to make sense of all the names mentioned, the flashbacks, the twists, and a tricky back-story that is given to us piece by piece. That said, when all the things come together, it does work well for the most part. Alan Parker's direction is both subtle and sharp, and he really does a fine job capturing the noir-type mood. He's also able to bring the 50's era to life without going overboard or relishing in it, he just simply shows it. The slushy New York locations contrasted with rainy, humid New Orleans suit the story very well (the change in climate being a reflection upon Harry's own comprehension and, indeed, fate), as does the bluesy/jazzy soundtrack. And that pounding heartbeat really helped to turn the tension levels up. Mickey Rourke is excellent as Harry. He's got just the right amount of New York accent and brings true emotions to his character; formidable, frightened, or distraught, he performs realistically. Now Robert De Niro, it's just a pleasure watching him as a sly Satan! His mannerisms, from a slight grin to a menacing glance to eating an egg, are wonderful. I've read some negative remarks about Lisa Bonet's acting in the film but I thought she did just fine with her role, as did the rest of the cast. So, aside from the sometimes confusing plot points, I thought Angel Heart was a very good horror mystery and holds up well for being nearly 20 years old. I really do enjoy story-driven films dealing with such subject matter and was not disappointed with the one in Angel Heart.",398,31,4,True
imdb_angel_heart_coventry_20040731,Angel Heart,IMDb,Coventry,2004-07-31,8,"Dark, complex and depressing...an outstanding film!!","Good supernatural thrillers with the incarnation of Satan himself as a pivot figure .we don't see enough of these films, if you ask me. Alan Parker's `Angel Heart' is one of the chosen few! Complex and confusing at times, but warmly recommended to fans of the occult and mysterious cinema. Mickey Rourke shines as protagonist Harry Angel. An unshaved, chain-smoking private eye with a chicken-phobia! The year is 1955 and the place is Brooklyn when Harry is hired by a malevolent Mr. Louis Cyphre (pronounce this name aloud a few times in a row) to find a missing crooner, who got severely traumatized in the war. The money is good and the job doesn't seem that risky, so Harry accepts. Pretty soon, the search takes him to all kinds of poverty, human misery, superstition and alternate religions. Every important figure in the search for Johnny Favorite (the crooner) finds a violent death after Harry talked to them and, apparently, our private detective is a lot more involved than he initially thought. As mentioned before, Angel Heart is a darn complex and very coherent film. One viewing is enough to understand the entire premise and main storylines, but a second (third or fourth) viewing sure isn't redundant. It would be a shame if any of the carefully worked out details and character-connections would go unnoticed. `Angel Heart' (and especially cinematographer Michael Seresin) also receives a huge plus for the dark and depressing portrayal of the film's surrounding. Angel Heart looks unattractive, vile and ominous which creates a superb horrific atmosphere. The supernatural aspects about the story are a bit overly stressed by clichés like silent and staring nuns or foggy New York suburbs. But this small negative element is largely made up by the subtle violence and compelling mystery this film features. The acting is outstanding with Rourke at the absolute top of his career. During the second half of the 80's, Mickey was the unforgettable star of several brilliant films such as `Barfly', `Year of the Dragon', `Nine ½ Weeks' and of course this `Angel Heart'. Robert DeNiro as Louis Cyphre was a downright brilliant casting idea! There isn't that much De Niro content in this film but, when he's on screen, evilness nearly drips from the screen. Bobby De Niro is probably one of the only actors who can make it look eerie to eat an egg! Lisa Bonet, in conclusion, isn't the world's most talented actress but Angel Heart sure is her best film. All in one, Angel Heart is a very good film that'll be appreciated by thriller fans and the admirer of slightly more intelligent horror.",440,75,16,True

Harry Angel (A cocky Mickey Rourke)is hired by a mysterious client named Louis Cyphre (A dark Robert DeNiro) to find a musician named Johnny Favourite. Angel is a crude, rather uncouth individual who, at first doesn't want the case, but the chance at earning a nice sum of money, jumps at the chance. Pretty soon, he wishes he hasn't as he is drawn into a very dark landscape involving voodoo,weird visions (Blood everywhere, a person in black sitting in front of an electric chair, and an elevator), and murder in Louisianna. Whenever Angel talks to his acquaintances, they end up dead in gruesome ways (One poor soul ends up in gumbo!). O.K. Kids, this is where the spoilers come into play, so if you haven't seen this film WALK AWAY NOW!!! There are 3 reasons why this film is incredibly creepy: 1) The ending: When Harry Angel finds out the disturbing truth that HE is Favourite and that Cyphre is Lucifer (Which people should have figured out in the beginning), you are in just as much disbelief as he is! How on earth did this happen? When Cyphre breaks it down, and the viewer can see the evidence, then it makes sense. Angel screams in denial, saying that he knows who he is, but then he (And us)starts to realize that he's wrong. He admits to himself (And to the viewers)that HE had committed the horrible murders in the film. 2)Lisa Bonnet: I was (and still am) a die-hard fan of ""The Cosby Show,"" and will always see her as Denise Huxtable. Her role as Epiphany was a total change, and to see her in an INCREDIBLY STEAMY love scene with Rourke totally shattered that image. Then for us to find out that she was Rourke's daughter? Another sin that will surely send him to hell (Incest, as well as murder). 3)The images and sounds:The constant use of blood,spiral staircases,and elevators are used in a nightmarish way. The viewer gets caught up in the nightmare, swirling out of control like Harry. The final image, of Harry in an elevator, going down, is the scariest of all. You KNOW who he is and what he's done, and he is going to burn. Simply put, he's on an express elevator to hell. One of Alan Parker's best, and he gets great performances from everyone, especially Rourke. And a guarantee good film to give you the shivers!",438,13,1,True

On the surface, that seems to be the moral of ""Angel Heart."" But look a little deeper -- the fact is, Harry Angel knew the truth all along, and here's the true moral: ""However cleverly you sneak up on a mirror... your reflection always looks you straight in the eye."" Much of the meaning in this dark tale lies in the above line uttered by DeNiro's character, Louis Cyphre. We can pretend to lie to ourselves and bury our heads in the sand, but in the end we know. And it isn't the knowing that hurts us, but all the hiding and lying that went on before. This film has been summed up many times before, so I won't do it again. It's also been said that the film was ahead of its time in 1987, and IMO this can't be emphasized enough. There's no doubt in my mind that it's been an influence on many a filmmaker and screenwriter. Among films of this type it's easier to follow than, say, ""Memento,"" but more befuddled and confusing than ""The Sixth Sense."" You may or may not guess the ending, but if you're the type who's bothered by confusing movies -- simply read all the spoilers or the whole screenplay, THEN see the film! I guarantee you won't enjoy it any less for knowing. Cinematography 10/10, screenplay 7/10, acting 9.5/10, overall I'd give it about a 9/10. If anything makes this movie great (and qualifies it as a classic) it's the cinematography and atmosphere. It really is richly and gorgeously shot, and atmospheric to the nth degree.

This is one of those films that seems to have garnered almost unanimous praise, so I feel a bit stupid in admitting that I found the narrative kinda hard to follow; a lot of the symbolism also seems to have gone right over my head, making the film a bit of a chore to fully comprehend. Angel Heart is, however, an undeniably stylish movie, with excellent visuals that make particularly good use of light and shadow (imbuing proceedings with that all-important pulp/film-noir atmosphere).

Angel Heart is a winding psychological thriller that -- in 1987 -- was far ahead of its time. So far that audiences didn't `get it' and the film bombed at the box office. Only now are we beginning to see endings like this one surface in horror movies. Had Angel Heart been made a decade or so later, perhaps it would have succeeded. As it is, the movie  which has a strong cult following and was recently re-released on a Special Edition DVD  is nothing short of mesmerizing. I wouldn't go so far as to call it great, or a `masterpiece,' but it is scary, disturbing, influential, thought-provoking, and a lot smarter and more atmospheric than 99% of the rip-off horror movies being made today. It stars Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a private eye from Brooklyn in the 1950s who is hired by Louis Cyphere (Robert De Niro) to locate a mysterious singer named Johnny Favorite, who disappeared in the early 40s and hasn't been seen since. Angel's journey takes him from the streets of New York to jazz clubs in Harlem and, finally, to the sweltering swamps of Louisiana. He meets a variety of characters, all of who have little to say about Favorite. All we seem to know is that he was a singer, entered the war, and was shot, had his face reconstructed, was taken out of hospital care, and apparently vanished from the face of the earth. I guessed the twist of the movie about seven minutes in, as soon as Robert De Niro appeared on screen during an extended cameo. But that's not to say that the movie won't affect you. Notorious when released for some controversial scenes (including a sequence involving Rourke and The Cosby Show's Lisa Bonet), the movie's moody atmosphere is its strongest element. The acting, too, is very strong. This is Rourke's finest performance, as Harry Angel, a scumbag detective with nothing to lose. On the new DVD, Rourke claims he wasn't very interested in acting at the time, and as a result `just showed up' and `memorized the lines.' I find that hard to believe  Rourke's acting here is Oscar-worthy. His recent descent into self-loathing has caused his career to fall apart (he was never enthusiastic about acting and wanted to become a boxer instead); he shouldn't discredit his earlier work merely because he's upset with his life. The role of Louis Cyphere (get it?) is also one of De Niro's most ambitious performances; he delves entirely into character and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. It was directed by (Sir) Alan Parker, the famous British filmmaker (of, among others, Midnight Express). Some say this is his finest film  wonderfully crafted, beautifully shot, masterfully edited  and I'd have to say that if it isn't his best, it certainly ranks somewhere at the top.",495,117,17,True

A few decades of wealth, power, fame, and sex in exchange for an eternity of suffering the fires of Hell? Evil may be fascinating, but stupidity never is, and we quickly lose interest in the fate of anyone dumb enough to do that. The story fares much better when understood in the allegorical sense, of course, but it is always better if a story makes sense literally if it is to have much value figuratively. This movie solves that problem. Johnny Liebling is a crooner who thinks he knows a way to trick Satan. He makes a pact with him, in which Satan gets Johnny's soul in exchange for fame as a singer, under the name Johnny Favourite. Having made the deal and benefited from it, he then performs a ritual that involves cutting the heart out of a soldier and eating it. By so doing, Johnny is able to substitute the soldier's soul for his own, the result being that the soldier's soul will have to suffer the fires of Hell, while Johnny's soul does not. The soldier's name is Harold Angel, suggesting his innocence, of course. As part of the ritual, the soldier's dog tags are sealed up in vase. Only if Johnny himself opens the vase will the ritual be undone. Because Satan wants Johnny's soul and not Angel's, he must trick Johnny into breaking open the vase. When World War II breaks out, Johnny is drafted and subsequently suffers an injury, which causes him to have amnesia. He spends some time in a hospital, but his friends get him out. Not knowing what to do with him, they simply drop him off in a crowd of people on New Year's Eve. As a result of Johnny's confused memory about swapping souls with Harold Angel, he comes to believe that he is Harold Angel, and eventually starts working as a private detective under that name. Ten years after the war, which is when the movie starts, this Harold Angel is hired by Louis Cyphre (Lucifer) to find Johnny Favourite. Angel does not realize it, but he has been hired by the Devil to find himself. We do not realize it either, at this point, and we are encouraged by the movie to like Angel and to identify with him. He seems to be basically a nice guy. As he starts investigating, he begins experiencing disturbing images from the past. Little by little, he begins to suspect the truth. He is horrified at the idea that he might be Johnny Favourite, and having come to like him and identify with him, we are horrified too. In his desperation to assure himself that he is who he thinks he is, he breaks open the vase, and the dog tags of the real Harold Angel fall out. The spell is broken. At this point, Louis Cyphre appears, announcing that Johnny's soul now belongs to him. Finally, recent memories that Johnny had distorted are replaced by accurate ones, and he is forced into the realization that he has murdered several people. Because Johnny thought he had a way to trick the Devil, this story works on a literal plane. And by making us like him as Harold Angel and identify with him, the movie forces us to realize that we too may not be as good as we like to think we are, that we too have something inside us that is evil.

It has the detective angle of ""Chinatown"", with people turning up dead, questionable connections and a private dick who may have to hide from the cops himself (well, that could be ""Maltese Falcon"", too, I suppose). ""Serpent""? Well, just the voodoo aspect, and both films came out about the same time -- this being the better of the two (sorry Wes Craven).

I mean, I do not normally think of him as a creeper, so what do I compare this to -- ""Cape Fear"", I guess. Or ""Little Fockers"". Roger Ebert says director ""Parker's films are always made with great gusto, as if he were in up to his elbows and taking no hostages"" -- he uses ""The Wall"" as an example, which is nothing like this film, but they both do have an intensity that any moviegoer ought to appreciate.

It has a tendency to leave you feeling quite disturbed and unsettled. This can be attributed mainly to the films last 15 minutes, wherein the lead character Harry Angel, a private investigator (played by Mickey Rourke), learns the emotionally devastating truth behind the case he has been working on. Rourke is quite good throughout the entire movie, lending his character a certain sleazy-cool charm, but it is in the films last few moments that he shines best. His harrowing display of pain in these scenes is so intense and believable that you truly feel his despair. Robert De Niro who appears in only a few scenes (in a key role), also does good work. Now for the down side. Director Alan Parker from the very beginning imbues his film with such a heavy atmosphere of impending doom that we hardly have a chance to breathe. If he had perhaps lightened up a bit in those earlier scenes, the ending would have slowly crept up on us and been even more shocking and disturbing than it was. Also he attempts to combine the horror and detective genres with only moderate success (especially in the later case). What usually thrills us about classic film-noir detectives is their sarcastic wit and hip dialogue. This verbal element is sorely lacking in ANGEL HEART, so the audience tends to latch onto the visual aspects of the investigation which are not enough to keep us totally riveted for the first two thirds of the film. On occasion the director also loses his sense of subtlety and allows sex, blood and gore to steal the show (as in the bedroom scene with Rourke and Lisa Bonet).

I immediately knew this was going to be my 1987 film of choice. The actual product was a bit of a let down I'm sorry to say. The biggest and most glaring problem this film has is simply that it's painfully boring. A mystery of sorts is set up and then we watch the character of 'Angel' going from person to person asking around trying to find a guy. We are given no reason to care about this mystery and very little along the way to mix things up and keep it interesting.

It begins on a very ominous note and remains gripping all the way through its serpentine story. Mickey Rourke, in one of his very best performances, stars as Harry Angel, low rent NYC private eye hired by mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro, who's fantastic) to locate a vanished crooner named Johnny Favourite. His search leads him from NYC to New Orleans, and with the story (based on the novel ""Falling Angel"" by William Hjortsberg) taking place in the mid-1950s, that merely adds to the overpowering atmosphere. Along the way, the dead bodies start piling up, and Harry finds things just getting more and more gloomy as his search moves inexorably towards its devastating conclusion. I think that a key to this films' success is that it *can* work even for the viewer who knows the major revelations beforehand, or guesses at them early on. It's the gravitas that Parker and his fine cast brings to the proceedings that make it so compulsively watchable. Also appearing are Charlotte Rampling, beautiful as ever, in the role of black magic practitioner Margaret, and the stunning Lisa Bonet, who's memorable in the role of young mother Epiphany. Familiar faces in smaller roles include Pruitt Taylor Vince, as a detective (he acted again for Parker in ""Mississippi Burning""), Kathleen Wilhoite, as a nurse, Michael Higgins as a drug-addicted doctor, musician Brownie McGhee as Toots Sweet, and Dann Florek ('Law & Order: SVU') as an attorney. As this story plays out, one just knows that whatever Harry finds out, it won't be pleasant, and the dark tone extends to the memorable sex scene, which is erotic and creepy in equal measure. The music score by Trevor Jones is suitably eerie and there's a serving of blues music that is irresistible, adding to the overall experience. In the end there's a strong message about the nature of living a lie, and the final confrontation between two characters is brilliantly subtle, depending on acting rather than spectacle or much in the way of cheese. This represents a solid effort from all concerned. Eight out of 10.",378,14,2,False

I think it's great; what other private-detective movie ends with the gumshoe discovering he's the killer and he didn't even know it (even The Big Sleep isn't that cracked) ? What sells it for me is Rourke's solid blustering performance - he steers a great course through smartass, out of his depth, bewildered, disbelieving and resigned as he's manipulated through the story by forces he can't control. The rest of the cast are good, with DeNiro in the plum role as The Lord Of The Flies himself, subtly underplaying it to great creepy comic effect.

It's a very straightforward story that ends up being more than meets the eye, mixing in horror and satanic elements to become a one-of-a-kind thriller. Private detective Harry Angel (Rourke) takes on a case to locate an old-time crooner named Johnny Favourite, who has been missing since WWII. He is hired by Louis Cyphre (De Niro) who has an ""unfinished contract"" with Favourite. It's fairly apparent that the devil is owed someone's soul, but Angel doesn't pick up on these clues as obviously as we do. Angel goes from name to name in search of people who knew Favourite and a trail of murder follows mysteriously behind him. Other than the delightfully creepy performance by De Niro, director and adapter Alan Parker deserves the praise for the enjoyable parts of this movie, namely it's suspense. His use of heartbeats for this dreadful suspense effect and the way he intercuts the scenes of shocking discovery with normal ones (such as a boy tap dancing in the streets of New Orleans) is nearly adrenaline-pumping. His depiction of rotating objects such as the fan and elevator cable spool is a bit blunt, but stylishly effective. Being an '80s film, you definitely get a sense of movement toward the modern thriller as we know it today. The style of the film, its pacing, its tendency to sit quietly at times and be introspective -- these are things we've come to know from the genre 20 years later, but as a '50s period piece as well, there's a definite tribute to film noir in the characterization and acting. Rourke's Angel is much like those P.I.s that get in too deep from the '30s and '40s. The dialogue too is very much the same way. Not spectacular but not disappointing, ""Angel Heart"" is entertaining and certainly unique. People who are into movies that involve elements of satanism, where the devil is a character, will certainly enjoy it more, but most will get enjoyment out of its classic mystery structure and intriguing twist.",355,1,0,False

ANGEL HEART is in essence a mood piece. Set during the 1950s, it chronicles the efforts of a private detective to track down a missing person who soon finds himself in some very dark places. With a string of unpleasant sex and violence scenes, excellent direction from the always-good Alan Parker and some quite wonderful performances, this is a real classic. There aren't that many films that deal with modern-day voodoo in a non-biased way so this one's a real treat. Parker is adept at crafting atmosphere and you can almost smell the cigarette smoke in this seedy, grubby little film. Mickey Rourke, in a career-best performance, is Harry Angel, the protagonist. Angel is a pretty unpleasant guy who thinks nothing of using violence as a method and yet Rourke embodies him with a raw humanity that makes us warm to him from the start. Although he's the archetypal tough guy he projects an air of bruised vulnerability that makes him riveting to see on screen. He has some great supporting actors with him, too; Lisa Bonet excels in a layered performance as the voodoo-practising Epiphany Proudfoot; Charlotte Rampling as a fortune teller; finally Robert De Niro, as great as ever as the sinister Louis Cyphre. The film is pretty slowly paced but laced with moments of action and violence that breathe life into it. My attention never wavered for a second. There are occasional missteps – I could have done without the 'glowing eye' stuff that takes place at the climax, that only serves to cheapen the effect; good when used in films like FRIGHT NIGHT, but not here!

Robert De Niro gets big billing but he doesn't have that many lines in this film. The ending of this movie has a very unique twist to it, but it's certainly not a satisfying ending. It is one I should go back over after the next viewing and check for credibility. That's all I can say without using spoilers. Overall, a sleazy but very intriguing story, with great atmosphere, that I enjoy watching every five years or so. Some would call this movie a modern-day ""film noir.""",199,50,20,False
imdb_angel_heart_rosscinema_20040328,Angel Heart,IMDb,rosscinema,2004-03-28,6,Murky but well made and acted,"It has been a long time since I first viewed this film in the late 1980's in an edited version to get that ""R"" rating but it's finally available for everyone to watch in the original version that the director wanted. Story is set in 1955 where a sloppy and dirty private eye named Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is given a call for a job and he heads to a church in Harlem, New York where he meets Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) who gives him $5,000 to try and locate someone named Johnny Favorite. Angel heads to a mental hospital where Favorite was a patient and there he learns that a doctor was given a large sum of money to make it look as though he stayed there longer than he did. The trail leads Angel to Louisiana where he meets Epiphany Proudfoot. *****SPOILER ALERT***** Epiphany (Lisa Bonet) tells Angel that her mother knew Favorite but now has no information on whether he's alive or not. While in Louisiana some of the people that knew Favorite start to die suddenly and it usually comes after Angel has interviewed them and the local police start to wonder how he is involved. This film is directed by Alan Parker who has such a diversified resume as far as the different types of films he has directed. But two elements in this story are reminiscent of previous efforts by him. The first is the time period (In this case the 50's) and Parker has dealt with period pieces before. And secondly he has made films that showcased the Southern culture and this film does a commendable job of being shot in the humidity of Louisiana. I personally am not as high on this film as others and it's primarily because the script does wander and then lag in the middle as Rourke's investigation goes on without even a hint that he's getting closer to the target. This is a muddled and murky mystery that seems to go on and on but there are some things that raise this film high enough for me to recommend. The set design gives this film such a rich feel for it's time period and the cinematography by Michael Seresin is excellent as he captures the heat and sweat of the Louisiana Bayou. Seresin has shot many of Parker's films and together they certainly have a special relationship that's reflected in their work. But the special thing about this film are the good performances by Rourke and Bonet and they together give one of the steamiest sex scenes in movie history. Parker had to trim it by a few seconds to get the ""R"" rating but you can view the original scene now on DVD. Rourke plays one of the sloppiest characters in recent memory and he's always unshaven and dripping from sweat. But with that he still keeps the audience interested in what he is doing during the investigation and Rourke always had good screen charisma. This was Bonet's first big role in a film and she's very good as a sexy young Cajun girl that's involved in black magic. This should have led her to some sort of a film career but it never did which is to bad because she shows so much promise here. This story has many twists and turns and even though it bogs down after a while it's still a well made film that leaves an indelible mark of sorts.",579,3,3,True
imdb_angel_heart_baumer_20010904,Angel Heart,IMDb,baumer,2001-09-04,10,I know who I am!,"I have often said that horror is the most difficult to master. I believe this to be true because although it seems any moron with a camera can stalk a would be victim and try to psyche the audience out by shaking a few trees, then flagitiously embellish the film with blood instead of atmosphere, true fear is difficult to capture on film. I think we have all seen films that lay it on pretty thick but ultimately fail. I truly believe you can hire someone to make a dummy and stuff it with blood and even some rudimentary designs of intestines and hearts and various other functioning organs that have the ability to make the squeamish cover their eyes. But if you remember some of the greats, some of the icons of the trade, you will see that a good horror film is more about minacious shadows, the vicissitudes of lights, the ominous and foreboding music and finally the brilliant sagaciousness of the story. I think many people overlook the relevance of a story in the horror movie genre. Many inferior films like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Idle Hands and such will present us with a half-assed story and then try to build on it by bombastically insulting us with the banalities of gore and other not so shocking elements. But what they forget is most horror films that either succeed or develop a cult following are films that somewhere along the way hit a nerve in the collective mindset of their viewers. Friday the 13th's attack the very foundation of one of adolescent's unadulterated joys, that being camping. Halloween invaded our trick or treaters and Nightmare On Elm Street surreptitiously alienated our dreams. In short, we were not safe from these abominations on any front. Angel Heart follows that trend. Spoilers Ahead... if you have not seen this film, do not read from here on out. The basic premise of Angel Heart is a detective story at heart. This is a 40's style film noir complete with rain soaked streets, seedy detectives and lots of questionable characters. We meet Harry Angel ( Roarke) as he is taking a phone call from a stranger. This stranger is from the law firm Winesap and MacIntosh ( any similarities here? think about it). They would like to meet with him as they have a client that is familiar with his work. The client's name is Monsieur Louis Cypher. ""Is your client foreign? Is he a foreign gentleman?"" Harry then travels to a church ( strange enough place to meet a client who wants to hire a detective) where he enters the room and is first greeted by Winesap (who looks a lot like Stephen Tobolwolski), and then he sees his client. But what we see first is long, perfectly manicured finger nails, a strange cane, a ring that has either the star of David in the middle of it or a strange cult like pointed symbol, you decide. Also, the client's hair is put up in a bun and the man dressed impeccably. The man does not rise to shake Harry's hand. But he smiles with a diabolical, factitious grin that seems warm and inviting but reeks with deceit. Harry then gets the facts of the case and is told that he will be searching for a crooner that owed Louis some money but disappeared during the war. So in essence, all Louis wants from Harry is to find out if this crooner is alive or dead. Cypher offers him a lot of money to find the guy and so Harry accepts. ""You must want this guy pretty bad,"" Harry says with a chuckle. ""I don't like messy accounts,"" Cypher replies dead-seriously. And then just before the meeting concludes, Louis says to Harry, ""I've got a funny feeling we've met before."" Harry has no recollection of ever meeting the man, and he would remember seeing how Cypher sticks out like a sore thumb. From here Harry goes on a labyrinthine journey to find out what happened to this crooner. It takes him from Coney Island to New Orleans. And along the way, dead bodies begin to show up. First he interviews a doctor that had something to do with the case. He shows up dead in the next scene. Next we see an old guitar player named Toot Sweet and then he shows up dead, ""strangled with a part of the body meant for pissing with."" Now Harry is a suspect in two murders and it just keeps getting worse. Every 20 minutes Louis Cypher shows up to check on his progress. And every time he does, more strange religion seems to get introduced to the plot. This French gentleman is obviously a fanatical, devout, religious iconoclast. He is not just seeking this missing person for personal accounts, it seems more like a reckoning. And the further Harry gets into the mystery, the more liable he is to be implicated in things that he had nothing to do with. To make matters worse, Cypher tells him that he has old fashioned and bucolic ideas about justice, ""You know, an eye for an eye, that sort of thing."" Finally Harry, in desperation, asks him in one of their sittings, ""Who the @^&* are you Cypher?"" Cypher's reply, ""Watch your language, this is a church."" By now the film has us both intrigued with it's eccentric and neurotic characters, and confused in some ways by the abstruse manner in which the story is unfolding. This apparent confusion is by design, because this film takes pride in laying the foundation out for us but not the glue. We have to use our heads to figure things out and that is rare in many films, especially the horror genre. That may sound contradictory to what we are all lead to believe about most horror, but it is true. Horror, true horror has gone the way of the do-do bird. It is all but extinct. Angel Heart however, is more of a heterodoxy than one might think. It takes all that is good with the genre and makes it even better. Every scene in this film seems to quietly show us another piece to the puzzle. Every twist and turn seems to unravel the story like the layers of an onion. Without giving away the plot and the secrets to the film, here are a few scenes to digest and think about. Take for instance the not so subliminal use fans in the film. Every time Louis Cypher is in the room, fans are first shown. This is relevant in some scenes because of the heat, but what about on a cold blustery day in the Bronx? Also examine some of the intriguing lines that slither out of DeNiro's mouth. Lines like, ""They say there is just enough religion in the world to make man hate one another, but not enough to make them love."" Or: ""Would you like an egg Mr. Angel?"" After Harry says no, Cypher replies, ""you know, they say the egg represents the soul."" He then bites into the egg and chews it with perfect equanimity. You can never tell if Cypher is mad or satisfied. All we know is this man is here to find a missing person. Some of the time he cracks a smile but what he is really smiling about is just somewhere underneath the surface. There are also a few times when Harry catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror but he sees two images of himself, the mirror is cracked or split or mangled in some way. And he always looks pensive and confused when he looks into the mirror as though he sees something.... but then forgets it. We are also privy to scenes that are ripe with contradictions. Bullets are stored in a Bible, a nun is cleaning blood off the wall, a priest wants to drive in a Rolls Royce, a heart is cut out, almost like a butcher did it and took pride in his work and a few other images that confuse yet enlighten you at the same time. Angel Heart is the true working of a paradox in progress. The climax of Angel Heart is one that will have you shell shocked. I wasn't prepared for it when I saw this film as a 17 year-old and even now when I am pushing 30 and have seen the film over 100 times, I am still in awe when I watch Harry and Louis banter about as Louis tells him of his ultimate fate. ""Alas. How terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise Johnny."" ""My name's not Johnny."" ""I know who I am. Cypher I know who I am!"" When all is about to be revealed, Louis tells Johnny to take a good look in the mirror because no matter how cleverly you sneak up on a mirror, you reflection always looks you straight in the eye. And when he does, all that we didn't know but may have suspected, is now revealed to us. Angel Heart is not the type of horror film that will scare you every five minutes with ghosts that bounce balls down stairs or with pumpkin candles that flicker coyly enough to see a shadow float across the ceiling. But what it will do is turn your insides upside down with the promise that something pernicious and final is about to take place. Angel Heart is opulent with undertones of doom and sumptuous with forbidden overtones. Just as Blair Witch attacked us with what could be there, Angel Heart admonishes us to stay away from things that should not be there. Harry Angel has entered into an inchoate project and it is one that he will wish he never sought out in the first place. This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and along with Halloween and Jaws, not only does this film rank highly on the horror charts, it cross polinates into the top films ever made. I am not sure where I would put this film because to compare a film like JFK and Raiders of the Lost Ark with an atmospheric, spine tingling film like this is like comparing a top of the line BMW to a top of the line Jaguar. Where do you start and how do you stipulate which is better. All I know is that this film made me fear what it warns us about. And it made me interested to read the Bible again. That has to count for something. After all, the Bible is filled with stories of fire, brimstone, people turning to stone and burning bushes and deceit and betrayal. Sounds like fun, doesn't it? 10 out of 10-- This is the epitome of horror and if you have not seen this film, I urge you to find it and watch it this weekend. Mickey Roarke and Robert Deniro are priceless and keep in mind, this is brought to you by the same team that gave us films like T-2, First Blood and Basic Instinct. This was a different kind of film for Kassar and Vajna and I am thankful they decided to take a chance on a dark film like this. Add Alan Parker to this brilliant behind the scenes team and you have all the ingredients for one hell of a ride.",1911,25,9,True

Sadly, I thought it was way too predictable, and they went way too far with the metaphors. On occasions they tried to te profound, and end up being unintentionally funny, especially when De Niro shows up. I'm still trying to understand the first scene's relation with the rest of the film. It seems to serve only to set the tone, but there was a million different ways to do it, all which make much more sense than a random dead woman in an alley being smelled by a dog.

""Angel Heart"" starts out dark and brooding and just keeps getting darker and darker. It will almost even test your limits, which is exactly what it sets out to do. Even though Robert De Niro's on screen time is small and limited, he steals every scene he is in. A strong performance in a limited role. Set in the mid-50's, the story follows the investigative trail of private detective, Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke), as he goes south into voodoo country to discover whatever happened to a man named Johnny Favorite - a crooner famous in his day. He is employed by Louis Cyphre (De Niro), who claims that Favorite still owes him from a contract agreed upon some years ago. When Favorite disappeared, Cyphre hires Angel to find out what happened to him. The deeper Angel digs, the more he finds out. The more he finds out, the less he wants to know. The dead bodies start to build and soon the local authorities are naming him the primary suspect - leading to the film's startling and unnerving conclusion. This film is unabashed in it's visceral detail and raw portrayal of the unlucky victims who fall prey to a murderer's schemes. I would have to say that this was also the most intense sex scene I've ever seen, and that isn't necessarily a good thing. I had my suspicions going in about what was really happening behind the scenes, and I got it right. The how and the why was a big mystery to me, so I paid attention. And you do have to pay attention, because it is easy to get lost. Once the final realization hits you, it will make you stop and think. It's that kind of film. This movie is well produced and filmed. The editing was top notch for it's day, and the special effects were perfect and not overdone. You will get some chills and there are a few scenes where you will want to look away, but you won't be able to. However, it is low on the re-watchable scale. It isn't the type of movie that someone would say that they watch it over and over again. If they did, I would begin to wonder about them. It will tug at your dark side and make you uncomfortable.

In esoteric lore, you cannot actually sell your soul to the devil because you don't own your soul, it is a part of the highest god level. You can only think you sell your soul to the devil and go through with whatever deal you think you have. If you don't know you have a deal, you cannot be asked to pay.

First of all, the script is very sound, combining tight noir mystery and bizarre paranormal carnage in one seamless, endlessly bleak atmosphere that unfolds beautifully and economically. It's one of those movies were clever hints at the final plot twist exist throughout the duration of the film, but it's only at the end that all the pieces fall into place. Some people have told me they saw the end coming, which i will not reveal here, but i think most people will be too engrossed in the gorgeously filthy, decaying set pieces and grizzly violence to pick up on all the hints, and even then the movie still delivers on the grounds of execution alone. Rourke gives his all-time best performance (with his role as Marv in Sin City following at a close second), and imo perfectly depicts a man falling completely apart emotionally as he progresses further into madness. Parker is masterful here, maintaining a constant aura of doom and mystery, juxtaposing the quiet main piano theme brilliantly against Rourke's failing sanity.

But I found the first half of the film somewhat ponderous and I was a little uninterested in where it was all going. Things pick up a little in the second half as the supernatural elements begin to shine through, and of course the twist ending. The problem is that I knew this was all leading up to something and for the most part I was just waiting to see what. The production design by Brian Morris and cinematography by Micheal Seresin is top-notch and combine to give the film a really good atmosphere and look about it. It's very well made and has superb performances from both Rourke and De Niro but as I said I just wasn't 'into' it as many people seem to be. Once you've seen the film it has no re-watch appeal at all, the whole film is just an excuse for a twist ending which may, or may not impress you. There is some minor gore but not much, there is also a little animal cruelty with a cockfight and a chicken that has it's throat slit in a Voodoo ceremony. There is a pretty steamy interracial sex scene between Rourke and Lisa Bonet, and various other little bits of nudity here and there. Don't get me wrong, I liked it. It's just that I was a little disappointed after hearing so many good things about it. Definitely worth watching but I personally don't think it's the masterpiece many make it out to be.",470,3,5,True

Very confusing film, I couldn't work out what was real and what wasn't, and the ending doesn't make sense to me - if Angel is really Johnny what is the relevance of him killing all those people?

Angel Heart, set in Brooklyn and New Orleans, is one of the most beautiful cinematic films I've ever seen. Parker really took advantage of the surrounding scenery. But what stands out the most in this film is the acting. Mickey Rourke, who plays Harry Angel, is phenomenal as usual and proves that he really is one of the greatest actors of his generation.

imdb_angel_heart_bandsaboutmovies_20200113,Angel Heart,IMDb,BandSAboutMovies,2020-01-13,6,More mumbo jumbo,"Following the publication of his 1978 novel Falling Angel, William Hjortsberg began working on turning it into a film. His friend, production designer Richard Sylbert (Dick Tracy, The Cotton Club) took the book to Robert Evans, who was running Paramount and was ready to make the film with John Frankenheimer set to direct and Dustin Hoffman in the lead. That option expired, as did another attempt to get the movie made with Robert Redford. Years later, producer Elliott Kastner met with Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone, Midnight Express, Fame, Pink Floyd: The Wall, The Commitments) to discuss him writing the screenplay. Parker also helped get the movie funded by Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna as part of Carolco Pictures, as long as he was given creative control. Parker made several changes from the novel, retitling the story Angel Heart, including moving the second half of the tale to New Orleans and moving the time forward four years to 1955, so the story feels like it belongs more to the 40's than the coming 60's. He also worked toward making Harry Angel more sympathetic and Louis Cyphre more realistic. Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a New York City private investigator who has been hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) to track down a singer named Johnny Favorite, who has been dealing with PTSD from World War II. Even the upstate hospital where Favorite was staying can't find him, as his release was facilitated by two mysterious people and a doctor was convinced to change his records. Cyphre offers Angel a large sum of money to continue hunting for Favorite. The trail leads him to Favorite's fiancee Margaret Krusemark (Charlotte Rampling) and the discovery that he had sired a daughter named Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) with an ex-lover. Everyone that gives Angel info - guitarist Toots Suite (blues musician Brownie McGhee), Margaret, the doctor - dies horribly. This causes Margaret's father to demand that he leave town, but of course, he goes back to his hotel room and has rough sex with Epiphany while visions of blood drip down the walls. So - follow me on this - Margaret and her dad were the ones who took Favorite out of the hospital. And the former singer was a sorcerer who sold his soul to the Devil to be famous, but tried to get out of the deal by kidnapping a soldier in Times Square and eating his heart to take the boy's soul. Now in that soldier's body, he went overseas and suffering facial injuries and amnesia during some fighting. If you haven't realized it yet, our protagonist and Johnny Favorite are the same people and the none-so-cleverly named Louis Cypher is the devil himself. And everyone dead in the movie? Yeah, our so-called hero killed them all and then had sex with his granddaughter. Gulp. Although initially supportive of Bonet's decision to make this movie, America's one-time dad Bill Cosby dismissed the results as ""a movie made by white America that cast a black girl, gave her voodoo things to do and have sex"". How did that all work out? De Niro's performance as Louis Cyphere is supposed to be based on his friend and frequent collaberator Martin Scorsese. For what it's worth, it so unnerved Parker that he avoided him during his scenes and let him direct himself. You know, before The Wrestler, so many people forgot just how good Mickey Rourke can be. You should discover that for yourself by going back and watching this for yourself.",588,4,9,True
imdb_angel_heart_seymourblack_1_20140216,Angel Heart,IMDb,seymourblack-1,2014-02-16,9,A Creepy Thriller With Some Good Twists,"""Angel Heart"" is a dark thriller that begins very conventionally when a private detective is employed to undertake, what seems to be, a routine missing persons case. This is misleading, however, as the investigation is soon characterised by a series of dead-ends, bizarre murders and strange encounters with the supernatural that give rise to the types of tension, violence and shocks which continue to be present at various points throughout the entire movie. The plot is thoroughly absorbing, offbeat and full of surprises and the quantity of blood on view is absolutely extraordinary. Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is an unkempt, small-time, private detective who's hired by the immaculate but rather mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to trace the whereabouts of a crooner called Johnny Favorite who'd achieved some success in the period just before World War 11. Favorite had suffered serious injuries during his time in North Africa where he'd been entertaining the troops and had spent time in a mental hospital near Poughkeepsie where it's believed that, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, he'd been treated for shell shock. Cyphre had helped Favorite to launch his career and wanted to know if he was still alive because there were some clauses in his contract that remained unfulfilled. Angel soon discovers that something irregular had happened 12 years earlier (in December 1943) when he traces a clearly falsified document relating to Favorite's apparent transfer to another hospital and then discovers the body of the doctor responsible who'd just been brutally murdered. Spooked by this experience, Angel decides that it's unsafe to continue with the case but after Cyphre increases his fee, he agrees to carry on. His further investigations bring him into contact with a sophisticated fortune teller called Margaret Krusemark (Charlotte Rampling), the daughter of one of Favorite's secret lovers, Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) and a blues guitarist called Toots Sweet (Brownie McGhee) who'd previously worked in a band with Favorite. All three are distinctly unhelpful and the gruesome events that take place following his contact with them have a powerful effect on Angel who's sharply aware that he's steadily unravelling but can't do anything to improve his predicament. Alarmingly, things get even worse for him when the reasons for his involvement in this dangerous and seemingly intractable case are finally revealed. Some of the content in ""Angel Heart"" is shocking and controversial but its greatest quality is the unsettling atmosphere that's present from start to finish. The dark street scene that opens the film sets a sinister tone and everything that follows from the eccentricities of Cyphre to the sounds of the descending steel elevators continues to suggest a lurking threat. This creepiness is further emphasised by the use of drained colours, high camera angles and views of a spiral staircase that work together brilliantly to create a sense of continuing unease. In a tremendous performance, Mickey Rourke inhabits his role so fully that he's utterly convincing as he portrays the difficult changes that Angel goes through and Robert De Niro also makes the most of the scope that Cyphre's character provides. ""Angel Heart"" has a haunting quality that makes repeat viewings irresistible and enough twists to ensure that such experiences are both rewarding and enjoyable.",538,9,3,True
imdb_angel_heart_rmax304823_20070328,Angel Heart,IMDb,rmax304823,2007-03-28,6,The Fifth And a Half Sense.,"It opens with Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a bummy kind of private eye in a seedy office in Brooklyn in 1955. The black plastic phone rings. It's a potential client, a law firm. ""Do I know what an attorney is? Sure I know what an attorney is. It's like a lawyer but the bucks are bigger."" The lawyers names are Winesap and Macintosh -- two apples. A long-forgotten crooner is missing. He owes the lawyers something and they want Harry to track him down. A missing person case. Harry meets the client in the loft of an Evangelical black church in Harlem. It's Robert DeNiro overly decked out and trying on an elegant accent. The story soon gets complicated. People begin to turn up with oddball names -- Proudfoot, Johnny Favorite, Evangeline Krusemark, Toots Sweet. So far, we feel we're on pretty normal ground here. A Raymond-Chandleresque mystery will follow, during which we'll lose sight of the original problem while we meet eccentrics, goons, and pre-verts, and we'll be taken down colorful paths into mansions and down into spooky basements and people will be knocked off for reasons we don't understand. Well -- yes, but with two or three twists. One twist is that the next thing we know, we and Rourke are out of Brooklyn and into New Orleans and environs. Another twist is that the story moves into the orbit of the supernatural -- voodoo, black magic, mummified hands, pentagrams, Satanism, selling one's soul to the devil, and all that -- and it's meant seriously. I mean the devil is real and is a real character in the film. (Why he insists on meeting Rourke in a Catholic church and warning Rourke against using the F word in such a place isn't entirely clear.) The third twist I won't reveal except to say that the people who made ""The Sixth Sense"" might have seen this ending. It's a weird movie, overall, teetering on the brink of being arty. Off-kilter shots of ventilator fans slowly creaking to a halt. Rain turning into blood for no apparent reason. Murders committed for no apparent reason either. And not only that, but the victim's heart is cut out and left on the floor. There's a thin line between beauty and baseness, and at times this film and its editing go beyond atmospheric into plain sloppiness and self indulgence. Much is made of the voodoo thread that leads Rourke to Louisiana but in fact it has nothing to do with the central event of the story, which might just as well have taken place in the apartment of Rosemary's baby. DeNiro is a great actor but he's in the wrong role here, or rather the role is wrong for him. Whatever else he is, DeNiro is always grounded. But here his lines are written as if meant for somebody like Clifton Webb or George Sanders. Mickey Rourke -- whatever happened to HIM? He's very good in this, as he was in many of his earlier films. The next thing we knew he had a new raggedy haircut and a pair of boxing gloves. What a loss for us. Lisa Bonet is beautiful and sexy and demonstrates how well suited she was for a television sitcom. The musical score is pretty good except at times, during moments of dread, we get a booming heart-like sound that's guaranteed to induce at least a headache and at most a gallop rhythm. There's another loose end to the plot that keeps nagging me. I can't understand why any of the murders were committed. And another. Why does Mickey Rourke wind up having to pay his dues when in fact he's not the same guy who signed the contract? He has a different face and a different brain and a different set of memories. He doesn't even KNOW he's the guy who first made the deal. Is he held to the contract because he happens to have the same set of fingerprints? Somebody tried to ploy the system once in Connecticut after a sex change operation and were foiled because of that simple dermatographic fact. At times it's a little tiresome but it's worth catching if you haven't seen it, especially if you're unfamiliar with Mickey Rourke's talent, curious about Lisa Bonet's bosom, or a fan of the occult.",722,3,6,True

imdb_angel_heart_talahaseeslittlebrother_20241112,Angel Heart,IMDb,TalahaseesLittleBrother,2024-11-12,8,Wanna hear one of his tunes?,"Even in the '80s they didn't make 80's horror quite like Angel Heart. It isn't popcorn horror. It isn't teen horror. It probably isn't horror at all. Angel Heart is a period, neo-noir detective thriller that happens to find itself in a mystery embedded in the occult. The thrills and scares are deliberately serious and gratuitous, however the true horror lies in the art and craft of the film-making. For every blood-soaked sex scene, grizzly murder or voodoo dance with a dead chicken there is equal helping of symbolism and suggestion. While the book Falling Angel (1978) is predominantly set in New York, Angel Heart moves from the cold of the 50's Big Apple to the sweltering heat of the South, the journey to Hell being represented by the change in the colour palette. While the film may show a little too much for some viewers, others will be surprised by how much it hides in terms of exposition and requires an interpretation of its imagery. And the music?! That sax? Those big band tunes and the blues... wow! Forget the telltale signals that this is an 80's movie; it looks and sounds fantastic. But more than that, the atmosphere it creates is as thick and viscous as blood. The scene on Coney Island beach is aesthetically near perfect. As for criticism of the acting... who? The leads are great even if DeNiro is hamming it up a little playing his pal Scorcese! (Note - the part Marty plays in Taxi Driver can be interpreted as the Devil... and note the similarities in their appearance...) Rourke never looked cooler and Bonet is a revelation. Now for the controversy. No, not the sex scene (it has to be gratuitous and graphic for the payoff to work - the nightmare has to end with the smashed mirror, the revelation and a violent stop) No, the controversy concerning the plot twist as it pertains to Louis Cyphre. ""It's silly."" ""It's too obvious."" ""I saw it a mile off."" These are poor interpretations. We always suspect that Cyphre is the Devil. It's signposted everywhere. It's a movie with a fake name in the title - and the title contains the word ""Angel."" And it's about contracts and Devil Worship and satanism and black magic and they even talk of summoning Lucifer himself! The cover of the book HAS LUCIFER ON IT! It would have been more of a surprise if the Devil HADN'T appeared! The real twist is that Angel is Leibling/Favorite and that the girl is his daughter! This is why Lucifer's fake name is, to paraphrase Angel, a cheap joke. The Devil gets Angel/Leibling/Favorite to seduce his own daughter and then murder her in the most obscene fashion and thus be sent to the electric chair whereupon the Devil gets his soul. El Diablo certainly has an evil sense of humour. To conclude, Angel Heart is surprisingly good, serious and intelligent thriller/horror hybrid from a decade when style ruled substance. It was ahead of its time and remains a firm Favorite of mine.",511,3,0,True

Mickey Rourke stars as private detective Harry Angel, who gets hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert de Niro) to find out if a certain Johnny Favorite, or Liebling, is still alive. His investigation takes him on a rollercoaster journey of fear, with people involved in the case dying around him. The suspense is pretty well set up. I enjoyed the sense of mystery, and Cyphre himself as a very mysterious character. Hail to the cinematographer for a job very well done. Certainly from a cinematography point of view, this was masterfully done. The performances from the entire cast is also very good and believable. There's a lot of reference to black magic and voodoo, and false prophets. And then there's the sensual element, with plenty of frontal nudity - some subtle, some in your face. My main criticism in 'Angel Heart' is the main character smoking too much - maybe because of the sponsor, Camel? It was rather obvious and a bit annoying. The film does feel a bit slow at times, but nevertheless remains interesting thanks to the mystery. There's a shocking twist indicating evil was at work all along.

Mickey Rourke is very good in one of his very best films and De Niro is most effective. The rest of the cast are fine but although the story moves fairly slowly we seem to get introduced to various people in something of a hurry and are caught trying to play catch up with what has just happened. And then everything gets really fast. The major sex scene towards the end is a sensation and amid the sweaty sex there is water through the roof and blood from somewhere. Courtney Pine's wailing saxophone adds to the confusion and menace and from here until the end what has seemed fairly dreamlike turns into a nightmare. Despite all that is great here, and the voodoo scenes are particularly impressive, I'm not convinced that Parker was all that interested in the story itself and he seems to allow it to get a little buried under the extraordinary sets and effects that abound.

And I?","The hauntingly sad melody of a tenor saxophone sounds over a littered alley in America's loneliest city in sync to the steps of an unkempt man in a long baggy coat. His name is Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke). He is a private detective from Brooklyn but not very successful. Most likely, Harry never heard of Mikhail Bulgakov's novel ""The Master and Margarita"", otherwise he would have grinned skeptically at the title of the very first chapter, ""Never Talk to Strangers."" How would he find a client and get the job done if he doesn't talk to strangers? Such as a wealthy, sophisticated, and mysterious businessman named Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro). One fine day, Cypher made him an offer, which Harry did not refuse. The businessman tasked the detective to track down a once-popular singer named Johnny Liebling, aka Johnny Favorite, who disappeared without a trace many years ago. The businessman signed a contract with Johnny which the latter did not fulfill. The contract must be closed, and for this Cypher needs to find out what happened to the former pop star. Several features distinguish ""Angel Heart"" from many similar films with a sensible private investigator who undertakes an undefined mission and immediately encounters corpses lining his path. The director Alan Parker successfully combines elements of classic noir films, such as dark lighting, cynical characters, hopeless intonation, and a fatalistic plot with a modern vision, which gives the picture its uniqueness. The atmosphere pulls in from the beginning to the last shot, which is helped by the soundtrack. It includes not only blues and jazz compositions but also a human heartbeat in the background that raises the level of tension in many scenes. Parker realistically portrayed the era of the 50s, not exaggerating the importance of details, but not in any way ignoring them. The careful composition reveals in each frame only what is necessary at the given moment to return later in a shocking flashback and reveal the full picture of what happened and how. The contrasts between windy winter streets, alleys, and avenues of New York Boroughs and hot New Orleans fit the story because climate change and setting reflect the beginning of Angel's true understanding of the case he is investigating, of himself and his own role in what is happening now and what happened many years ago. Landscape filming, built on the screen opposition of two cities, penetrates at the visceral level. Gray and slushy New York in early January is freezing to the bone. When the investigation brings Harry to wet, stuffy, witchcraft New Orleans and its suburb of Algeria, the center of the ancient pagan cult of Voodoo, it is difficult to breathe and you wish for the rain that will clear the air, wash away the dirt from the broken asphalt of the streets, drown out the agonizing questions that persistently sound in the brain like the echoing beats of someone's heart, and will bring peace to the suffering soul. And the rain will come. A real tropical downpour, like the biblical flood. It will break through the leaking ceiling in a cheap hotel room and turn into streams of blood that will flood a squalid little room that has become a haven for two strangers, Harry Angel and Epiphany (Lisa Bonnet), a young Louisiana woman who might be a key to the secrets of the past. Tangled in a passionate embrace, they found each other for a moment in the labyrinth of other people's memories, blood, lust, betrayal, and death. But the rain will not bring purification nor hope. It will only plunge even deeper into the atmosphere of a nightmare with its unpredictable logic and the inability to wake up. Following a cyclical rhythm, ""Angel Heart"" again and again returns to the same point. Shutters slam, fans growl, an elevator rumbles, heartbeats become more frequent, flights of stairs diverge into endless heights and transcendent depths, and there is always a figure in black on the bench that will never reveal the face. All of this evokes a sense of uncertainty of what is happening and the subtly enveloping ominousness that the viewer experiences along with the detective, who is desperately trying to close the case. Mickey Rourke is superb as Harry. Deprived of ambition, not caring about how he looks, unshaven, shaggy, with puffy eyes, awkward, but inconceivably charming with an amazing, slightly shy smile, Harry Angel is sympathetic from the first appearance. Rourke brings true emotions to the character of his hero: frightening, scared, distraught, or resigned, he is always realistic, and you sympathize with him to the end, even when Harry Angel discovers the true nature of his investigation. The sinister tone of the movie is set by Robert De Niro with sharp long polished nails, a pentagram ring, fine manners, a slight grin, and elegant black suits. De Niro must have had a lot of fun preparing for the role of Messier Cypher: a neatly trimmed black beard, long hair slicked back and pulled into a bun at the back of his head, lighting and makeup tricks make him an uncanny Martin Scorsese's doppelganger. Considering what we eventually learn about Mr. Louis Cypher, this is a very peculiar and controversial dedication to the beloved director and close friend of the actor. At the same time, this is one of the manifestations of humor that is constantly present in a film which is anything but comedy. A mystical thriller, allegorical parable, and horror film, Angel Heart is a bright, talented, and timeless exercise in the style and synthesis of cinema genres, in which Parker and his actors give their best, and the bold imagery keeps captivating even if you guessed pretty quickly where the investigation would lead Harry. Long after the old rumbling elevator leaves the lonely passenger at the final stop after an endless descent, the fan, the embodiment of inevitability, sighs heavily in the final revolution, and the beating of the human heart that accompanied the entire film subsides, the viewers will not be able to shake off dark magic of the film. They will reflect on the duality of human nature, on the endless struggle of the forces of light and darkness for the possession of the soul, on the roads that we choose, but which, in fact, choose us. They will think about the price that one must pay for the chosen path. About contracts that no one has the right to violate, the offers that are so hard to refuse, and about strangers from whom you need to run without looking back. But where to?",1101,8,3,True

It's even set in the same era. Although, besides how its said to take place in the 50s and a few old clunkers, it feels more like 1987 than 1955. While it may start off like a standard noir, the further it progresses the more it seems to transform into a supernatural/horror thriller. As the true motivations to Angel's case are revealed-though I'm not sure if revealed is the proper word. This picture is a like the film Shutter Island in the sense that its clever twist isn't so clever in the end. As a matter of fact, what's actually going on is glaringly apparent from the moment its stated. But it's not as well made as Shutter Island and the movie's transparency only seems to hurt an already fragile film. I'm not sure if this just because it's such a mediocre film or because he's such a good actor, but the best part of this movie is Robert Deniro's chilling performance.

Always one step away from trouble Harry takes a new case from a rather sinister fellow named Louis Cyphre (DeNiro). It seems that a singer named Johnny Favorite owes Mr. Cyphre a debt that he is to collect upon Favorite's death and it becomes Angels' job to find him and determine his status. When all roads lead to mysteries involving the occult and voodoo, Harry will have to uncover a terrible truth and the cost could be his immortal soul. Acting: The acting is superb as each actor brings some really great nuances to their characters. Little scenes in this film seem to be made huge with these little additions. Like the scene where Angel meets Cyphre and DeNiro is rolling the hard-boiled eggs and Rourke counters the menace by tossing a pinch of salt over his lest shoulder. These are the little things that make performances priceless and enduring. Direction / Writing: Expertly written and directed by Parker, every frame of Angel Heart seems to have an inherent grunginess that becomes more menacing as the film progresses. Beautifully set-up scenes do at times seem to have such a textured darkness that the darkness itself seems like a character that threatens to envelope all the characters. Technical: The technical aspects of Angel Heart don't disappoint either. Trevor Jones musical score runs a gamut of emotion and feeling. Menace, longing, jubilant, jazzy and erotic overtones make for one of his best scores and he has made several. The editing is top notch too; every scene seems to wield yet another piece of the puzzle and is presented very well. The look of the 50's seems to be presented very well I am no expert on the period but they seem to have done a remarkable job of replicating it.

It is at this very stage, that the viewer gets completely drawn in, into this shocking tale of an investigator out to seek a missing person, for one really odd client. The premise sounds like a regular mystery of a missing person, with the investigator, Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke) following every lead he gets. But things are not as straightforward as they may seem, as Harold slowly uncovers the disturbing truth behind the disappearance. I am surprised Angel Heart doesn't even have a 8/10 rating on IMDb. It definitely deserves much more than a 7.2. At least from horror/thriller film loyalists, 'cause this one is definitely a cut above some other cheap, B-horror flicks. This movie is a close second to the brilliant 'Jacob's Ladder' from the same producers (Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna). Alan Parker's direction is excellent. The background score by Trevor Jones is well in place and perfectly complements the dark mood of the movie. What can I say about the performances that hasn't already been said! This is quite possibly Mickey Rourke's career best performance! He shows a wide range of emotions, with so much ease. He sinks his teeth firmly into the character and fits the role of Harold Angel to the T. Not to mention he has great screen presence and charisma. As for the great Mr. De Niro...this is one actor who never fails to amaze me. Just when I thought he couldn't possibly be as brilliant as (or better than) he was in Raging Bull or Taxi Driver or The Godfather Part II or even Casino, I come across this GOD of a performance..De Niro's Louis Cyphre! This is what a true performance is all about!!! And what's more, De Niro is hardly there on screen (maybe a total of about 15 minutes?), but you've got to hand it to him....he makes it a point to be extraordinary in every frame he appears in! This is one less known but magnificent performance from the legendary actor. And then there's a special mention of Lisa Bonet. She delivers in her small role as Epiphany.

Here's a movie that probably inspired the more recent flicks, The Devil's Advocate and The Ninth Gate. It has really good acting and very solid dialog, but the pacing is a little off and the plot revelations come very late in the film and rather clumsily at that. Mickey Rourke is really good. His character is pretty entertaining to watch, likable and revolting at the same time. The exchanges between him and most other characters are pretty good and Rourke's guy Angel gets in a lot of good lines. The homage to '40s noir is really excellent, the sets are legit and the music is moody and eerie and never lets up. This stuff carries the movie pretty far. Really excellent is the elevator motif and its recurring symbolism. I liked that a lot. Those elevator shots ruled and were way ominous. In the DVD extra interview, the director mentions the book this movie is based on stays central to NYC. But the director took creative liberties with the film and moved part of the story to the Louisiana bayou. This is where the film slows down and becomes somewhat choppy. A lot of stuff happens with loose ends or nothing is revealed to the viewer until the final scenarios play out, those of which I personally did not find to be anything particularly mind-blowing. The first half of the flick breezes by, but the second half seems to take a really long time. Oh, also the ""occult"" elements are totally amateurish (not to mention the horrible, horrible special effects!). I mean, come on people! Consult someone who knows their satanic jazz before you start talking about black magick and whosits. Intriguingly, I felt the same way about The Devil's Advocate and The Ninth Gate, though I thought those films had much better pacing, even though the acting might not have been up to par. It's worth watching if you're a sucker for Rourke's acting chops, occult or alternative suspense/horror flicks, or you just wanna see Rourke's hairless bum (I'm serious). The feeling of this movie reminded me of some of those decent H.P. Lovecraft movies (""From Beyond"") and the presence of a NYC-Bayou connection with the devil involved reminded me of that guitar/blues-related Ralph Macchio vehicle, ""Crossroads"", from around the same time as ""Angel Heart"".",392,1,8,False

It had a superb moody atmosphere with great locations like Cooney Island, New Orleans and The Bronx. Actors like Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro and Charlotte Rampling at the top of their form, and a slow dream-like quality not seen too much in today's Cinema. It also mixed ""genres"" very successfully - merging the traditional gritty private eye format with an occult supernatural story-line - a unusual amalgam at the time, and not really revisited since this fine outing. There's also a fair amount of black humour, and a wealth of sparkling cameo performances (Izzy and Wife) that add depth and quirkiness to the film - making the overall experience even more enjoyable. I get the impression that director Alan Parker was at a point in his career where he could choose the style of movie he wanted to make, and was willing to direct against ""type"" with this private eye/occult thriller. This must have been magnificent freedom for a director - along the lines of David Lynch and Spike Lee making the movies they wanted to, with seemingly little studio interference. Alan Parker had had great success up to this point with films like Fame and Midnight Express, so he had some clout with the studios, and they knew that he was likely to produce a quality movie. I think that Angel Heart is one of those buried treasures that has not even achieved ""cult status"" - it seems to be below the radar for most movie watchers - even the UK DVD release seemed low-key and budget-priced, but very well done with a superb transfer, director commentary and informative extras. IMDb review comments mostly praise the film - but I feel that it's an 80's gem that ranks along side Good Fellas, Blue Velvet and deserves a much wider audience.

O'Rourke carries that off really well - he injects a swarthiness and grit to his character who clearly isn't quite as hard as he would like people to think, and De Niro - though infrequently on screen - also manages to create that slight sense of malevolence as the penny begins to drop for all watching.

Ideally suited for mature and attentive viewers with a particular zest in movies seeped in a bizarre Dali-type surrealism full of mystery, supernaturality, violence, bloodshed and sex. I drags us into an hypnotic world of voodoo, mambo-jambo, black magic, and the Lucifer. But, this is not a classic-type horror flick per se. Instead, unique and stylish OCCULT-THRILLER like Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Ninth Gate"" based on intrigue, confusion and contradiction.

If you enjoyed these movies, ""Angel Heart"" would be a favorite piece in your DVD collection. Set in 1955, it is an excellent period work, as are the settings and cinematography, especially shots of dark, seedy, and steamy backdrops in Louisiana.

Quite frankly the destination is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that has plot holes big enough to drive an 18 wheeler through, but by that time we have been well satisfied and entertained by the ride to get there, so I for one am not complaining. I've watched this movie a few times now, first because it is so stylishly noir and evocative of a time and place and genre, and secondly because I really would like to get my brain around the actual premise of the diabolical transaction that took place. I really don't understand who or what Harry Angel is. His body is obviously not Johnny Fortune's, nor is it that of the original ""Harry Angel"", the army guy who was butchered as part of the ceremony to transfer Johnny's soul. And why did Margaret Crusemark and her father actually assist in this process, since we find out later that she hated Johnny Fortune? And why does she not recognise Harry Angel as being that soldier when they meet years later? So many questions, so many flaws, so fundamental that it forces you to watch the movie again and again to get to the truth, if there is one. If there is one thing I would criticise it is the unnecessarily gruesome way in which people die. Maybe it is true to the book, I don't know, but it adds nothing to the movie, and in fact quite the contrary, it jars badly with the standards you would expect in what is essentially a 1950s period piece. For me the fact that people simply die is enough to tell the story, I don't need to know they had their genitals cut off, or whatever. I love the little ""extraneous"" details that are thrown in. Like when Harry greets an unknown girl on the sidewalk and asks if her new boyfriend really owns a car. We never see her again, and it adds nothing to the progress of the movie, yet it says so much about Harry as a person, as part of a community, and makes you care about him so much more. Much has been said about Robert de Niro's work, I agree it's fine, but really no more than you would expect. I loved his line ""the future isn't what it used to be"". Who'd have thought the Devil could be a stand-up comedian. Mickey Rourke of course holds the whole thing together and he does a brilliant job of portraying a believable gumshoe doing the best he can, but for my money the best piece of acting comes from whoever plays the morphine addicted doctor.

Angel heads to a clinic where Johnny was last seen and visits the addicted Dr. Albert Fowler (Michael Higgins), who tells that Johnny was shot in the face and arrived in the clinic with amnesia and dysfunctional.

Spoilers ahead: My understanding is that Johnny conjured Lucifer and made a pact to become famous; in return, he would deliver his soul to the devil. The also Satanist Mr. Krusemark is impressed with Johnny and introduces his daughter, who also worships the devil, to him. Margaret and Johnny become lovers and find a means to lure Lucifer in a black book. Johnny and Toots kidnap the soldier Harold Angel in the Times Square and Johnny sacrifices him in a ritual and assumes his identity. He delivers his identification to Margaret inside a jar but he is summoned to fight in the war. He is shot in the face and arrives in the clinic where Dr. Fowler works with amnesia and dysfunctional.

Put simply its a thoroughly watchable affair that grips from the start and breezes by with nary a dull spell. Sadly for all its slick watch-ability its too flawed a work to be all that powerful or memorable but its entertaining at least. If entertainment you seek here you shall find it, but I can certainly see why this is lauded more by genre fans than critics. But the pluses first. Mickey Rourke is the biggest in his role as Harold Angel, private eye on the case. Somewhat cynical and sleazy whilst retaining a sense of righteousness its a spot on performance that impresses more and more as the film goes on and things get darker. A terrific focal point, and the rest of the cast is pretty spiffing too, Robert de Niro is on cool and quiet form as Rourkes wryly sinister employer, the ever classy Charlotte Rampling puts in an elegantly witchy turn and the comely Lisa Bonet makes a splash as a young priestess (who appears in the films most eyebrow raising scene. The film looks super too, from the dark alleyway opening with smoke curling up from beneath onwards there's a great sense of the life of place, of human bustle and animal scuffle, heat and wet, richness and poverty. And within it all is the suggestion of dark, but here lies the films main problem. As horror, as dark piece Angel Heart is never more than efficient. Sure there are grisly sights, ones that escalate during the course of the film to one or two nice shocks. But its all too clean and controlled, where delirious revelry is needed the film offers tight editing, smart framing and restraint, clinical cuts to the meat beneath the surface rather than a better double fisted clawing plunge. And much as the horror has little more than surface charm so does the rest of the film. Plentiful symbolic shots of air conditioners hammer home the plight of mechanisms against inevitability, but there's far more atmosphere than suspense and the films revelations are standard genre theatrics. Fate has a face but offers little more than standard villainy, a white man delves deep into colored circles but racial tensions are minimal, no doubt I'll find even more to pick up on with a second viewing. All this is not meant as seriously heavy criticism by the way, its still one of the easiest watched I've had in the past few months, an hour and three quarters or so whipping along like it was less than half that length well mounted with some aforementioned great aspects and quality moments. Its just rather frustrating to see a quality genre piece with a truly great work suffocating within, and at the close of play I couldn't help but sit back and ponder being let down. Still well worth a watch if you haven't yet though, may be lightweight but its still kind of a treat. 7/10.",543,0,6,False

A lawyer is hired to help a client seek out a man that he wants to get in touch with, that nobody has heard from in many years.

This was Rourke's next appearance after the blockbuster ""9 1/2 Weeks"" and before ""A Prayer for the Dying"" and ""Barfly"", which means it was made while he was just leveling off from the peak of his game as an actor. Rourke said so himself regarding ""Angel Heart"" that it was a movie he did in order to get the money to pay for the house he was about to lose, and was also around the time that he had realized that acting wasn't giving him what he needed anymore. I have to say, I'm glad he did this one rather than passing it up, as it contains some of the best of his more subtle acting. I must admit that when I saw this in the theater, I turned to my date and said ""Gee...Louis Cyphre, huh? A private dick, huh? Lookin' for someone who has gone missing with amnesia, huh? It's going to be him searching for himself - just watch."" Well, this truly did annoy my date, who brushed off my observation (which I thought was pretty evident to anyone with a brain) and I simply watched the film, treating what I'd already figured to be true as merely incidental to the film and enjoyed how the story was told. And told beautifully it was! Alan Parker and his production team of cinematographer Michael Seresin, production designer Brian Morris, & editor Gerry Hambling, create an incredibly atmospheric, rich and lush film worth seeing. For Parker's first venture into making a thriller movie, it was, for it's time, a completely original and welcomed approach to a much-abused genre. Watching the DVD today truly did please me for a few reasons. The main factor I appreciated about the DVD's special features were the segments devoted to the truths about voudon. The parts, titled ""Voodoo...The Truth - Voodoo in the Madia"" and ""New Orleans Voodoo Connection: History of Voodoo in New Orleans"" plus ""Dances of Worship: The Meaning of Dance and Music in Voodoo Worship"" and so on, showed a great responsibility on the part of the DVD's creators to dispel the much-negatively-portrayed religious belief/way of life of many people around the world, as well as telling the truth about how many lies this movie/the novel contained. Containing interviews and conversations with various practitioners, from Ava Kay Jones a Yoruba priestess, Brandi Kelly, the proprietor of ""Voodoo Authentica"", John T. Martin, manager of the Voodoo Museum in New Orleans, Ifa Priest Dr. Afolabi Epega, dancer and teacher Ausettua Amor Amenkum, and others, the ""special features"" is well worth watching, whether it be by an every day joe or joeanne, an initiate, or a practitioner of the faith. ""Angel Heart"" was yet another film that was frowned upon by the practitioners of Ifa, Santaria, Candoble, Lukumi, and other Yoruba belief systems, as it was yet another film that hyped the false negativity of this benevolent belief system. When the film was made the term ""voodoo"" was always associated with darkness, whether referring to ""voodoo economics"" or via its portrayal in the media at large. The fact that Satan is even personified in this movie is ridiculous when you look at the fact that voudon in any of its forms has no actual heaven & hell system. To tie the Judeo-Christian laws and beliefs in with something that has had to work in, around, alongside, and with the very man-made ideals that have sought to oppress or destroy it is hilarious at its best - destructive at its worst! When I see this happen time and again, I often wonder how many would be outraged if, say, Judaism or Baptist beliefs were portrayed in the same dark and destructive manner? So, I must say, it pleased me, a practitioner of Ifa tradition, to see that finally someone took the time to fill the general population in on the realities behind the practices that have been all but crapped on by the media! ~T.Paul www.t-paul.com",691,0,0,True

imdb_angel_heart_mattymatt4ever_20020317,Angel Heart,IMDb,mattymatt4ever,2002-03-17,7,Definitely an eye-opener,"""Angel Heart"" is a flawed, imperfect film that is far from brilliant, yet amazingly intriguing. Choosing Mickey Rourke as a lead was a mistake in itself. He is amusing at times, but let's face it--he can't act!!! He swaggers through each scene, doing a bad Bruce Willis impression. Mickey, you're no Bruce Willis! And the film is set in the 1950's, whereas Rourke seems a few decades ahead of his time. I was quite disappointed that Robert DeNiro has such a small role. He's practically plastered across the video cover, yet only has about ten minutes of screen time. Another attempt to capitalize on the success of a big-name actor. I'm pretty sure people wouldn't be as eager to rent the flick if Mickey Rourke was plastered across. But DeNiro was great in his role (a different, more low-key role than usual), and the little screen time he had I appreciated. Lisa Bonet has proven her talent in recent flicks like ""High Fidelity"" and ""Enemy of the State,"" but she shows practically no expression throughout this film and the only reason to check out this early performance is to see how great she looks naked. And she does have a banging body!!! OK, enough bashing. This is a unique, visually striking--though truly grim and unpleasant--mystery/thriller with a twist ending that comes from left field. The film doesn't always make sense, but it keeps your interest, sometimes making your pulse pound. Those who've seen ""Midnight Express"" and ""Pink Floyd: The Wall"" should be able to anticipate the gruesomeness of the material. Before viewing the movie, I heard a lot of hooplah about the explicit sex scene. Now I'm an avid moviegoer, so I'm very jaded when it comes to sex scenes. It takes a lot to shock me. But when watching the sex scene in this movie...I felt like I was watching underground porn or some sort of snuff film. It is THAT graphic! Walls start bleeding, naked bodies get covered in blood, we see flashbacks of orgies. Alan Parker went over-the-top, to say the least! There are other gruesome images, including a chicken sacrifice that would turn the biggest carnivores into vegetarians, but mainly this is a mystery--and what an intriguing one it is! And it was the plot--filled with twists and turns--that fascinated me most. I am not exaggerating when I say this movie is like nothing you've seen before. As I said, it's not the greatest, but it's definitely worth checking out. And after watching the film, you'll definitely want to chat about it with your friends.

imdb_angel_heart_tomsview_20130903,Angel Heart,IMDb,tomsview,2013-09-03,7,The devil you know,"""Angel Heart"" hoodwinks its audience even more than the plot hoodwinks its characters in a movie that cleverly combines the supernatural with a film noir style mystery. The story involves Harold Angel, played by Mickey Rourke, who is hired by the saturnine Louis Cyphre, played by Robert De Niro, to track down Johnny Favourite, a moderately well known crooner who disappeared years before. Favourite owes Cyphre a debt, the nature of which is not revealed until the end of the movie. Cyphre makes it clear that Angel was not chosen by chance and is offered $5000 to take the case. After a number of strange encounters in New York, Angel follows a lead to New Orleans, where he eventually finds people who knew Favourite. Among these are two women: Margaret Krusemark, played by Charlotte Rampling, a former lover of Favourite; and Epiphany Proudfoot, played by Lisa Bonet who Angel spies in a steamy voodoo ritual. Nearly all the people Angel tracks down that have a connection to Favourite are killed shortly after. Angel becomes more and more troubled by the case, and is suspected by the police. Cyphre eventually resolves the mystery with a startling revelation. The credibility of this revelation depends very much on Hollywood's firm faith in plastic surgery to change people to the point where their own mother's wouldn't recognise them. The plot of ""Angel Heart"" cheats shamelessly, providing an embarrassment of riches for plot hole explorers. The film is based on William Hjortsberg's novel, ""Falling Angel"", which was set wholly in New York. The book gets you in, and is certainly an original concept, however it does suffer from its fundamental gimmickry, which is also the weakness of the film. The film is opened considerably by moving much of the action to New Orleans; a setting that suits the story's central themes. Mickey Rourke's character, Harry Angel, is perennially sweaty and sleazy. He looks like he could benefit from a packet of those lemon-scented towelettes that are so handy after a meal of Kentucky Fried Chicken. He effects designer stubble on his chin, which owes more to Don Johnson's 1980's ""Miami Vice"" than to the squared-away look of the 1950's, the period when the film is supposedly set. Some reviewers have accused Robert De Niro of overacting in this film. De Niro, in fact, delivers just about the right level of ham balanced with understatement for what is a totally over-the-top character. Indeed, the prize for the most excessive overacting must go to Epiphany Proudfoot's baby at the end of the film when its eyes light up with a demonic glow; a heavy-handed touch in a movie that uses its other devilish effects judiciously. Trevor Jones' atmospheric, sax-accented score adds considerably to the mood of the film. The cinematography and art direction of ""Angel Heart"" are impressive, even if there is a fixation on swirling fans and interiors that are reminiscent of the musty clutter of a Peter Greenaway film. ""Angel Heart"" pulls off an outrageous story with flair.

When I watch this film many years ago, I ranked it as a five because as someone who believes in the power of God, I didn't want to give the devil any credit whether fictional or for real. But seeing this again 30 years later, I am astonished as to what a great film it is, a genuine piece of artwork that is more powerful with the passage of time and of course the onslaught of maturity, and I can look at it for the cinematic masterpiece it is. That doesn't mean that I'm not creeped out by the themes or many of the twists, but not remembering anything about it, I knew right away what that twist would be. If Mickey Rourke had never been in another movie, he would be an icon like James Dean today simply for having appeared in this. Likewise, Robert De Niro is outstanding, an example of pure malevolence as a mysterious client of private investigator Rourke searching for a certain rock singer who has betrayed him, leaving a debt to pay behind. Rourke starts off in Coney Island where he interviews people who knew Johnny, the rock singer DeNiro is looking for, and then ends up in Louisiana where further investigation either has him asked to leave or treated with a gentle welcoming and the information that helps him and putting the pieces together. The beautiful Lisa Bonet is unforgettable as the fragile looking young woman who plays a key role in finding Johnny, but she's involved in something dark as well which Rourke witnesses but for some reason isn't shocked by. Charlotte Rampling guest stars as a former New Yorker now in New Orleans who refuses Rourke any type of information, her brief scene powerful and revealing. Followers of the catholic faith might skip this though as there are references to certain elements that connects the church to the Faust legend. This was obviously too disturbing for many viewers at the time and obviously the academy found it went against many of their secret moral laws of the type of films that they would or wouldn't acknowledge. That created controversy in 1988, and looking back, I can say that this is just as good if not better than any of the best picture nominees for 1987 even though it is a difficult subject to want to give accolades to. The combination of mystery, horror and even elements of film noir helps this stand the test of time, and time has indeed been a witness to many nightmares.

Parker creates a wonderfully involving atmosphere and infuses a sense of dislocation into a period that has been trivialized in other films, with Rourke a capable, engaging leading man (at times looking like a Bruce Willis doppleganger)--his oft-unusual verbal inflections (his pronunciation of ""Evangeline,"" for instance) make Angel that much more a stranger in hostile, mysterious land. De Niro conveys a sense of subdued menace that (up until his final scene, at least) makes his ambiguity all the more intriguing; and Lisa Bonet has a small yet complicated role as the woman who may have the key to Favorite's whereabouts.

It is 1955, a decade along from WW2 and Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a small time Private Investigator. Early in the film he is solicited by a mysterious man through his lawyer to perform something of a missing person search. The mysterious man is Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro in a solid cameo) and the man he is to find was a popular African American singer named Johnny Favorite who had a minor pre-war hit before himself heading off to war. Cypher alleges that Johnny and he had a contract that was broken, and that Favorite still owes him. It is not for Angel to collect the debt, merely to see if Favorite is actually even alive so that Cypher can make his request formally And off Angel goes on the manhunt. After some early setbacks which see Angel put in minor peril he decides that this gig might be out of his league and heads to Cypher to make this clear. While Cypher explains to Angel just how badly he wants Favorite located – by increasing Angel's fee dramatically – he somehow manages to make the simple and banal task of eating a hard boiled egg infinitely more menacing than I remembered it being as a kid. Angel – now back on the case – follows the trail of clues to N'Awlins. Without going into the developments and twists in the case it is fair to say that the situation unwinds slowly in languid fashion, and we learn at the same gradual pace that Angel learns exactly who is involved and what is actually going on. Eventually Angel tracks down Favorite's former squeeze, who is already deceased but has left a young daughter named Epiphany (Lisa Bonet) who is maybe 18ish. Epiphany is smart and seems to know more than she lets on – she is also effortlessly hot – and Angel gets the itchin' for another ""chat"". Before he gets the chance to do that though he tails a blues singer who also seems to know more than he is telling, and watches as bluesman, Epiphany and a gaggle of scantily clad ""others"" perform an elaborate and frenetic voodoo ceremony complete with the sacrifice of a chicken. It's always the crazy hot ones who are into the voodoo. Now Angel realizes that there might be very good reasons as to why no-one seems to want him to know the truth. ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() People who meet with Angel as he goes about his investigation have a habit of winding up dead, though there isn't much on screen violence or gore, it seems that almost everyone involved at any level doesn't want the truth to come out.

On we go to the ultimate unveiling of the ""big picture"", with information and new facts coming thick and fast as the story moves faster and faster, involving more bizarre developments and situations. This all culminates in a quite satisfying payoff to end proceedings with Cypher arriving again and hoping to collect. This was the 80s before Mickey Rourke rode motorbikes too fast and before he got hit by both boxers, the bottle and the scalpel so hard that he started fondling panicky starlets in public. He is just the right mix of cocky, confident and resourceful here to believe what is going on and to see exactly why it was Angel that was set on the case in the first place. De Niro plays Cypher straight and understated, and obviously relishes the menacing dialogue and creepiness that his character exudes in his brief dealings, and Bonet is young and definitely hot enough, but she also manages to be very credible in her role. All in all Angel Heart is a very effective period thriller, it moves along at a slow pace and might prove a little slow and dated for some, but it maintains interest as Angel (and the audience) moves closer to the truth and boasts some solid performances from actors who could have let this all go extremely cheesy. Final Rating – 8 / 10. It could me 20 years to find this under-appreciated gem, you'd be doing yourself a favour if you looked it up sooner rather than later.

I was also living in the American South where most folks went to church on Sunday and if they watched a movie like ""Angel Heart,"" they kept that experience to themselves. I remember the movie in the context of its release, more for the revulsion it caused than anything else. I knew that the movie was ""bad"" because one of the main characters was the devil & because the film had stolen the virginity of Lisa Bonet in spectacular fashion. I also remember disparaging comments about ""bad boy"" Mickey Rourke who was proven to be ""bad"" for merely starring in this ""bad"" movie. Fast forward through many years of my adulthood, through the shattering of the religious & cultural boundaries which once stunted my artistic growth- I have now watched ""Angel Heart"" 3 times and plan to watch it again because it is impossible to fully appreciate the attention to detail in this film by only watching it once. Since first watching the film in the '80s when it was released, I have also become a big Mickey Rourke fan & have watched/listened to several interviews with Rourke & Director Alan Parker, including interviews from the movie set & interviews done many years later. It has taken me many years to appreciate what a spectacular movie this is. Both Rourke & De Niro are at the top of their games. Particularly interesting, is the back story between the actors. De Niro was the bigger movie star, but Rourke was every bit his match & according to Parker, came to the set each day, determined to prove his worth as an actor, and prove his worth to De Niro who was less invested in that exercise. Parker described their scenes together as ""like a boxing match"" where both actors would veer off script, in their attempts to outdo each other. Ultimately, although De Niro's performance is flawless, this was Mickey Rourke's movie and in another era or in another world, Rourke would have been nominated for the highest honors for his portrayal of the lead, Harold Angel. ""Angel Heart"" is everything a movie should be- great acting, great editing, sound, shot entirely on location in both New York & New Orleans. This movie terrifies, keeps us interested & above all, this movie has withstood the test of time and is actually better today than it was in 1987. How many movies which have won Academy Awards for ""best picture"" over the years are quickly forgotten? ""Angel Heart"" has taken its permanent place in history, culture & cinema.",436,6,3,False

The movie was about a private detective who is hired to find someone. But the person who has hired him is not quite what he seems. The characters in this film are good. I liked Harry Angel, the investigator. He was likable. The guy he is working for, Louis Cyphre, is awesome... if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean. Finally Epiphany Proudfoot was great. The actors playing these characters was also very good. The film stars Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro & Lisa Bonet. I was a little disappointed that Robert DeNiro wasn't in it anywhere near as much as I would have liked. Especially as his character was my favourite. The violence was great in this.

The choice of songs truly captures the era,but for me it is the background music used during Harry's flashbacks and his symbolic dreams that make the movie as far as the soundtrack is concerned.It creates the impression that there is a malevolent presence over Harry and that the case has initiated images of a past come back to haunt him. The flashbacks and surreal images make it a beautiful movie to watch and these images play on your mind as if they a making a psychological impact on yourself.These images are well timed and do not fragment the film nor does it come across as pretentious art. The actor's performances are very strong in this film and there is not one actor I feel I could criticise.Robert de Niro's cameo appearance is brilliant and he portrayed his character as being a man of mysterious origin and is utterly confident in himself.This portrayel of the Devil is preferable to Al Pacino's more animated and comedic Lucifer.Pacino's character seems to be engineered for mass appeal in a blockbuster movie while De Niro's is created for suspense and chill factors.Mickey Rourke is superb and it is a pity that we do not see him in more movies.

Pauleen Kael thought it was stupid; criticizing ,e.g., the constant symbol of the fan in the window. But that was just because Ms. Kael, once she disliked a movie, sometimes found the most trite things to criticize in order to justify her dislike. Incidentally, I think she once called Clint Eastwood a Fascist and not a very good movie director. Well...? Anyway, ""Angel Heart"" is such a good movie to watch and re-watch. The premise is so fascinating. Think about it: Do you know who you really are? What if you made a pact with the devil for stardom but can't remember any of it? In our celebrity crazed America, can you think about anyone who would do that? The symbols alone are worth watching. The fan, the broken mirror, all the voodoo stuff. I was a child during the time period of the 50s when this movie takes place. It is very nostalgic for me to remember seeing some of those props such as the converted street car turned Diner that I remember as a kid. Where they found all these props is beyond me. Now I have to tell you that the novel, ""Falling Angel,"" has some pretty explicit scenes of group sex in front of the devil who witnesses his followers offering a baby sacrifice to him that's left out of the movie. It's interesting if you watch Rourke's comments in the new expanded DVD version, he says he was in a very negative period in his life and doesn't recall much about working in the movie.

It actually hurts the film that you can work out DeNiro's character straight away from the moment he signs his name, but even so Parker ratchets up the tension as he sends 50's private detective on a wild goose (or should that be chicken) race trying to track down an old 30's crooner who, like doomed bluesman Robert Johnson that same decade, fancifully made a similar deal with the devil in exchange for his gift of music. In the end, he didn't have to look so hard, but even with the viewer knowing the denouement well in advance of the finish, still Parker cooks up a pungent gumbo of a plot, with steamy sex, incest, gory murders and diabolical undertones, filmed in a deliberately washed-out way as the film tries so hard to be the black and white noir its director wanted it to be. Extremely well cast and played, Rourke, pre-Botox, gives his face the chance to act and is just right as the persistent but perplexed down-at-heel private detective whose personal journey to ID Johnny Favourite ends with a return ticket to hell. De Niro plays his part with the requisite mix of devilish charm and beguiling charm while the very young Lisa Bonet, fresh-faced and just out of family TV show ""The Cosby Show"" gives a passable performance, perhaps just lacking that little bit of womanly experience to really have you believe she understands the part. Parker is to be commended for his vision with constantly changing background shots and the use of symbolic totems like old- fashioned electric fans and of course that ever-descending lift. I also loved the Times Square recreation, right in front of the couple kissing in that famous black and white V.E. day photograph (you know the one!).

A movie this bad doesn't even deserve to be remembered for that controversy, because the scene involved (I won't spoil it for you) is a yawner.

I love this movie, it's my favourite thriller. Set in 1955, the whole cinematography, is truly amazing, honestly capturing the period, one hundred percent with such interesting sets, backdrops, and detail, down to the smallest knick knac, probably about the best period I've seen. Rourke's apparel is perfect too. Rourke, in still one of his best ever performances, plays small time PI, chicken phobic Harry Angel, who's offered a hefty fee by a mysterious and slightly menacing character, Louis Cyphre (a flawless memorable performance from Deniro) to track down a musician, Johnny Favourite, who was into a lot more than just music, and could already be six feet under. His investigation leads him through Harlem, and the dangerous New Orleans, where he encounters a few incidents with some nasty looking thugs, warning him to cease his snooping. Only everyone Harry questions, winds up dead in some bloody gruesome ways, where even the castration of one 'em, a blue singers, is inferred. The gore is actually stylish and heavy. Even at it's we seen an unrelated victim who's had his throat slashed. Too that controversial goes too far scene, with Bonet and Rourke starkers, sc..wing where blood becomes an illusion of rain running down the wall, until their bodies are showered and drenched in it, I admit, had me thinking it'd gone too far on my few view, but those are the movies our sickies love the best, and this was one of those films. Another subject is thrown into too- voodoo, which intensifies it's creepiness, an angle I loved, where you won't believe Bonet does while partaking in a dance. I must say the background work of the plot is great, where at the end, you'll learn why all of the murdered are murdered, and brutally too, and why Harry as one private dick says, ""Burns"". A thoroughly engrossing, psychological thriller, while being an unsettling and foreboding journey, for nearly all it's running time, with danger at many a turn. A bucket list movie must.

Leaving comparisons with the novel aside (and that is true for 99% of Hollywood films based on popular novels), this film is about the mannerisms of the lead actor, Mickey Rourke. The movie must be having about a million camera angles of Rourke's face, the way he speaks, mumbles, stumbles, lurches, runs, drinks, fights, romances, jokes, grimaces, smokes umpteen cigarettes, etc etc etc. The pacing of the film is so slow that it is a perfect panacea for insomniacs. Robert de Niro, as usual, is a treat to watch, and his perfectly manicured nails made my perfectly manicured and coiffured wife, suffer from an inferiority complex. The allusion to voodoo is pure crap and the film suffers badly till the end, as it is neither a horror nor a murder mystery. It has absolutely no re-watch value, and I doubt that anyone will suffer the first 90 minutes of pure, unadulterated boredom, just to enjoy the 5-minute twisty end.

I always judge a great movie by the criteria: Is it good enough to watch again and again. The answer to this movie is yes. This movie is an unfolding mystery starring Mickey Rourke and Robert DeNiro. First off the scenery was spectacular. The movie is supposed to take place in the 50's, and it captures the film noir scenery perfect. I have to give credit to the director Alan Parker, who has an impressive list of films directed. Also amazing is Mickey Rourke's performance. Barfly is probably on my top ten list, and it starred Mickey Rourke. I loved his performance in that movie. It is amazing that he starred in two great movies in the same year. Both this movie and Barfly was released in 1987, and both movies in my opinion are required viewing. 1987 was an amazing year for Rourke. It makes me think maybe he sold his soul to the devil, just like the character he played. Prior to seeing Barfly and Angel Heart, ironically, I thought Rourke was a worthless actor. I saw him in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro man, and I could not understand all the hype he was receiving for being an actor. Now I understand! The story itself is complex, and it leaves the viewer to come to conclusions and answer their own questions. A look at the IMDb.com message board will verify this.

But it is a truly absorbing effort nonetheless, and one that I wouldn't pass up if it arrived on TV at some random moment in time. For all of Parker's dips into the kinds of montage-style editing that he perfected in the Wall, it's also in some small bits with a documentary feel, and in the most part a mood that melds together those dark crevices and corridors and alleys and shadows that one finds in the best of the film-noir period with the same dark tendencies of the supernatural film. It's even got a very typical 'noir' set-up- gleefully typical in actuality- as private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is sent by Louis Cyphre (ho-ho, though not as such played by the totally dead-pan De Niro) to seek out a man who welshed on a contract signed with him. It leads him through Harlem, then to New Orleans, into a whole web of black magic, voodoo, and sinister figures on his trail, and other skeletons in the closet to find. Parker's style is meant to ratchet up the questions raised in the viewer as the film progresses, and as any good twisty thriller goes it deepens these questions by the complexity of the protagonist, leading to the final twist that one may have seen done in quite a number of films since, but does retain its power as something of a dark catharsis for this character. Parker's success here rests on two facets: his blending of a mood of the nature of the people and of New Orleans in general, how people on the street, or in the voodoo dance at night, aren't overdone into some cliché but are shown as they are, as figures in this quasi-limbo Angel has gotten himself into. The other being the casting or Rourke and De Niro. The former gives Angel Heart much of its appeal: it's almost too easy to see Rourke as a gum-shoe, but here he plays it as a person cynical and witty, but also sort of damaged goods, hiding past wounds with a cigarette and look of the eyes. And as things become crazier all around him, little by little one sees the wear and tear on his psyche, until the final scenes when he breaks down into the other side of his tough guy act- vulnerability. De Niro, on the other hand, is so sinister in what he doesn't do. Considering how over the top his contemporaries- Nicholson and Pacinio- went with the role of the devil himself, this may be the most subdued of them all, which makes it all the more chilling (see the egg scene), with the Scorsese-esquire beard a good asset. Although the casting isn't altogether perfect- Rampling is given an all too brief role to work wit, the minor characters being reasonably well suited for the atmosphere, and Lisa Bonet being just about adequate, though not quite the same caliber as Rourke, in her role as a mysterious bayou teen who is the daughter of the suspect in question- having these two heavyweights under Parker's command is quite staggering for any movie fan to enjoy. It's a strange feat to accomplish, but somehow Angel Heart holds up since its release twenty years ago as a genre hybrid sleeper, where the hardest- and darkest- thing to find is probably right inside of oneself.",619,4,2,False

imdb_angel_heart_predragreviews_20170405,Angel Heart,IMDb,PredragReviews,2017-04-05,9,"""Watch out for those chickens Harry.""","This is an intriguing, unusual, beautifully directed, highly atmospheric film that successfully crosses any number of genre: film noir, thriller, mystery, and horror. The plot is simple. In the mid nineteen fifties, a mysterious and slightly sinister business man, Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro), hires Brooklyn gumshoe, Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), for a missing person case. Angel's investigation, for which he is being paid a princely sum for the time, takes him from Harlem to New Orleans, as he looks for a former crooner named Johnny Favorite, who sometime during the early nineteen forties apparently welched on a business deal with Louis Cypher and hasn't been heard from since. In my opinion this is very much a film which you will be able to enjoy on repeated viewings, to savour the art of the cinematographer as well as to get a better understanding of the complexity of the plot. Yes, there are several murders and quite a lot of blood but I think you will be doing yourself a disservice if you choose not to buy for that reason. To a great extent the violence is retrospective and not in the same stomach wrenching category of 'Saving Private Ryan'. Robert De Niro is sensational in the highly stylized, role of Louis Cypher. He imbues the role with just the right amount of sardonic humor and restrained menace so as to make the character memorable. De Niro leaves an indelible imprint on every scene in which he is in. Mickey Rourke, who is in nearly every scene in this film, shows that he has the ability to carry a movie, as he is simply terrific as the private detective who is slowly unraveling. As the film progresses, the toll that the investigation is taking on the tormented Angel is evident on his face. Angst ridden, bleary eyed, and disheveled, Angel is definitely involved in the biggest case of his life. As he gets closer to the truth of what happened to Johnny Favorite, the more his life seems to be spinning out of control. Rourke manages to convey all this, no easy task. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and adds to the flavor of this delicious gumbo of a film, which is reminiscent of Goethe's Faust. Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",382,4,2,False

Every cinematographic element in this movie is pretty extraordinary. From the incredible performance of both Robert De Niro and Mickey Rourke to the masterwork of Alan Parker. There is a perceivable balance in the visuals between a melancholic celebration of the 1950s, (the shots embrace that imagery fully, almost like an Edward Hopper's painting) and the expressionist use of Chiaroscuro where the sinister undertone of the movie takes over, but the two coexist perfectly to create a truly unique feeling throughout the movie. The screenplay embraces the dualism of the descent into madness/descent into hell and it does so gradually, with increasingly disturbing and gruesome elements that eventually reach an inevitable peak by the end. However at its best Angel Heart is not just style over substance, is a very captivating supernatural thriller that keeps you glued to your chair all the way to the end, wanting for more.",164,4,2,False
imdb_angel_heart_padawandoug_20030226,Angel Heart,IMDb,padawandoug,2003-02-26,10,"Great Cinematography, Great Story, Great Acting -- These make a Great Movie","I just thought I'd add a few words about this great movie. First of all, it is great, and I hope you reading this will side with the large number of positive reviews and see this movie. The few people who didn't like it must be pinheads (or short attention span types)! *** Spoiler Alert *** This movie is not new, so I don't feel shy about discussing some spoiler type info. Louis Cyphre = Lucifer; this should be easy, and tipped me right at the beginning the first time I saw the movie. But I still wasn't sure until the scene a little later where Mr. Cyphre says that in some cultures, the egg is the symbol of the soul. He then proceeds to eat the egg (hard boiled), in a creepy shot. He eats souls! At this point I said to one of the guys I was seeing the movie with ""he's the devil!"" To those who may be confused by the details of the soul-switching scenario, and why the devil took so long to come after Harry Angel/Johnny Favorite: the ceremony they performed back at the beginning of WWII was to give up Harry Angel's soul in substitution for Johnny Favorite's, thus cheating the devil. Then Johnny was going to take on Harry Angel's life and escape the devil indefinitely. But then Johnny was shipped off to war, got a head wound and amnesia, and ended up really thinking he was Harry Angel (okay, I'm a little unclear on this bit, but I haven't seen the movie in a couple of years). So what it comes down to is, Harry Angel is really Johnny Favorite, even though he doesn't know it. And since he is, and his soul belongs to the devil, Lucifer can command him to commit murders, even without his conscious knowledge! This is how Johnny/Harry killed the blues musician, and the astrologer/former girlfriend, and the old addict doctor without even knowing it! And you realize then that the Lisa Bonet character is really his own daughter! One of the only movies I've seen where incest is part of a movie yet not the main point of it. This movie is just beautifully shot as well. See it in widescreen if you can, Alan Parker always has great shots that deserve it. I remember a shot of a spiral staircase at one point that was just beautiful. And I will never again see a fan in a movie (an electric fan) without thinking of this movie. That's another clue: every time you see a shot of a fan, and the blades start moving, the devil is in the room! It starts right at the beginning, when Angel first meets with Mr Cyphre. It's winter time, but fans are going! (On a side note: isn't it appropriate that the devil has a French name? Given current political feelings, I mean; of course, I'm biased -- an Anglophile -- so I don't like those weasely Frogs to begin with.) There is so much to recommend this movie that it's hard to pick things: from the humorous touches (""Do you know what today is? It's Wednesday -- it's anything can happen day!"" I never was a Mouseketeer, but it's a great reference to the period.) (Also funny: ""I got a thing about chickens.""); to the great music -- that haunting song, which seems so real, like it was a real song from a crooner of the '40's, as well as the real blues featured in the movie; even the end credit sequence is great, with the elevator cutting back and forth with the credits -- an elevator going straight to hell! The movie also shows a creepy movie version of New Orleans which could seem cliche to some, but is so well done, and fits so well with the period of the movie -- reminds me of another great one, ""Southern Comfort,"" where there's this whole community of Cajuns living in the bayou, just oblivious to the outside world. I also love movies that blow up the illusion that the past was better than the present. Every culture tries to promulgate that, but it is just resistance to change. The '50's was no happy time, people were just a lot more deluded than they are now. This is a great movie to watch, a great movie to listen to (I eventually bought the soundtrack), and one with a great story. Alan Parker is one of the sort of underground geniuses of filmmaking. He directed Pink Floyd's The Wall, too. Another great movie of his is ""The Road to Wellville,"" not a mystery, but another period piece, this time about the 19th century (and how squalid it could be), and the exploits of Kellogg, the guy who founded the cereal company. See that one too (it's a lot funnier than ""Angel Heart,"" and stars Matthew Broderick, Bridget Fonda, Anthony Hopkins and Dana Carvey in another overlooked movie. Perhaps not as ""great"" as ""Angel Heart,"" but still really good)!",839,4,2,True

It's just simple like that but at the same time it isn't. It doesn't mean Parker's picture is a licentious screening of Goethe's tragedy or stylized retro-noir. It is a unique piece of cinema that had never been done before or after. Having received rather controversial reviews buy American critiques, it's been underrated from the very release. It got it's cult meaning only years later, when it has been recomprehended around the world. But even today many people see only movie's external cover not willing to think on it's deep philosophical issues. In my opinion, this this certainly Mickey Rourke's best role and it's a big pity seeing what he did with his career. De Niro makes a very memorable cameo as Mephisto. In fact, the whole casting seems to be just perfect, from cold-eyed Charlotte Rampling to magnifying Lisa Bonet.

imdb_angel_heart_bbhlthph_20100904,Angel Heart,IMDb,bbhlthph,2010-09-04,1,A very misguided attempt to create horror.,"Verbal stories, books and dramas, based on the theme of someone prepared to bargain with the devil, and ultimately selling their immortal soul in return for worldly treasure of one type or another, have been a part of the literature of almost every culture and religion since the dawn of writing - so it is inevitable that the cinema has its share. I will nail my colours to the mast right away - in my opinion none of these works surpass the classic play ""Dr Faustus"" by the early English dramatist Thomas Marlowe, either in well rounded dramatic appeal or theological relevance . For me, this play although not totally original towers above later and often better known versions of the Faust legends such as Goethe's dramatic poem or Gounod's opera. All of these however transcend Angel Heart. This popular film still carries a (for me) incredible IMDb users rating of 7.3; if compared with them it can be seen as the absolute trash that it was. Assuming the supernatural was what its makers wanted to feature they would have done far better to base their film on Marlowe's great out-of-copyright drama rather than to purchase rights to a twentieth century imitation set in New York, and then stiffen the content by stirring in a gratuitous mix of voodoo rites that had nothing to do with the book they were filming. But they appear not to have known or even cared, whether their aim was simply to create a horror film designed to appeal to impressionable young people or whether it was to provide some sort of morality linked message - ultimately they achieved neither. True the film has a certain superficial gloss which is initially attractive, but ultimately most of it is simply ludicrous and where its search for horror runs unchecked it becomes crude and disgusting. If its makers aimed simply to create a horror film they needed to recognise that horror comes from showing ordinary normal people going about their normal days activities, and then to gradually make the viewer aware that these people are unknowingly only a hairbreadth away from some contingency that will change their lives for ever. Think not of imaginary monsters or supernatural events, but of such ordinary situations as 2,000 people following everyday activities on the Titanic when they were told that most of them were five hours away from spending their last five minutes battling the cold waters of the North Atlantic. Or think of the office workers in the twin towers carrying out their normal daily activities five minutes before the terrorist's 'plane struck and doomed almost all of them. Among films, few create such a sense of horror better than 'Naked Fear' where a young girl quietly trying to earn her living in a strange town suddenly discovers she is on the hit list of a maniacal serial killer. But Parker's films are always flamboyant and he is not the right director to produce such a film. Instead we have a film steeped in necromancy which can raise little more than a chuckle with its juvenile efforts to make our skin creep. Murnau did far better with his silent classic 'Faust', filmed in 1926 but still supporting an IMDb rating of 8. Did the makers of 'Angel Heart' ever watch this? I have not read their original novel but I understand its scenario was entirely set in New York. Parker has attempted to rake up the horror by shifting the scene to New Orleans and bringing in some lurid voodoo rites. Voodoo beliefs provide much of interest but I felt they were better featured in such simple low cost B movies as 'French Quarter' or 'Barravento' and I do not know what place they were supposed to have here unless it was to provide justification for some of the extremely crude and gross, but totally pointless images - often verging on the obscene - gracing this film. Ultimately for me the only real emotion these raised was extreme distaste. I can only hope that those responsible for the planned re-make are determined to avoid repeating Parker's fiasco.",688,14,27,True
imdb_angel_heart_knightsofni11_20110605,Angel Heart,IMDb,KnightsofNi11,2011-06-05,8,"The feel bad movie of 1987, and I love it!","Terrifying would be a good word to start out a review of Angel Heart with, wouldn't it? Yes. It would. This movie will chill you to the bone. It's the story of Harry Angel, a detective looking for work who takes a job offer from a mysterious man named Louis Cyphre. Cyphre is looking for a man named Johnny Favourite and offers Angel $5000 dollars to find the fellow who has mysteriously gone missing. But as Angel's search goes on, key people in his investigation begin to die off under gruesome circumstances. All the while the investigation leads him to dark underground cults filled with disturbing amounts of voodoo and chicken blood. Angel Heart is a movie that disturbs on all kinds of levels, never once letting up and only growing creepier and creepier as time goes on. Good, sincere horror is hard to pull off, but Angel Heart manages just fine in being a truly scary, truly enticing film. The storyline takes us to the darkest and creepiest of places, taking all sorts of gruesome turns that lead us to a dramatically excellent ending. It is a film that looks to scare, yet also engage and entertain in a sophisticated yet grotesque way, and it does just that. Some would say that it goes overboard on the sex and violence, but for such a satanic and evil film, I would say it has just the right amount. This movie is like a mysterious and foreboding dark hole that, through sheer terror, draws you in closer and closer then grabs you by the neck and scares the living hell out of you when you least expect it. My only complaint would be that on the way to this final big scare, the film drags a bit and gets pretty slow right before the epic conclusion that will leave you disturbed yet mystified. I give the film a lot of credit for telling such an excellent story, but I cannot forget the hauntingly beautiful cinematography that drives this film so well. The film is shot incredibly well with each frame as poignant and tightly constructed in the most artistically creepy way possible. The film doesn't completely rely on the blood and guts to scare you, it uses immaculate cinematography to entice you and sicken you at the same time. Alan Parker directs the film with a keen eye for the grotesque yet glorious, framing beautiful shots that capture the films disturbing darkness, as well as mixing in some fast paced scenes with an abundance of quick cuts that scream right into your face and keep you so heavily engaged in the film that you just can't look away. The film boasts some truly masterful visuals. Angel Heart is an excellent horror film that plays itself so much smarter than the average horror film, while still maintaining a healthy handful of blood, guts, and thrills to be scarier than the average horror film as well. Don't expect to leave this film happy or jolly. This film is dark, grotesque, and downright evil. But it isn't trying to sugarcoat any of the disturbed terror it is trying to instill, so from that perspective it succeeds so immensely. It drags in the middle, but it pays off enough with its exhilarating and shocking ending. Angel Heart is a fantastic film.",556,4,2,False

imdb_angel_heart_the_void_20040729,Angel Heart,IMDb,The_Void,2004-07-29,9,Great Mix of Horror and Noir!,"Angel Heart is the successful fusion of two great genres; detective mystery and demonic horror. However, this film is a mystery first, and a horror film second; this is shown by the way that the main emphasis is put on the mystery, and not on gory set pieces and the supernatural side of the movie. The film plays out much like your average neo-noir for the most part, in that a private detective is hired and by means of talking to several people, he is able to follow up his leads to solve the mystery. Angel Heart is no normal murder mystery, however; as within the film is a strong satanic influence, and that is where the film draws it's originality from. The story of Angel Heart revolves around a man, Louis Cyphre (a clever variation on 'Lucifer'), that hires a private dick (Harry Angel) to find a man (Johnny Favourite) that 'owes him a contract'. As previously mentioned; the film plays out like a normal mystery thriller, with the detective investigating his leads and the mystery progressing from there. Angel Heart is very intricate, and this therefore requires the viewer to pay attention to the movie. This is a quality that is admirable in any mystery movie; it makes sure that the audience will pay attention to the film, as missing a moment of the movie could result in you losing the plot. Angel Heart moves slowly and intricately, but it has more than enough to keep anyone interested, most notably an intriguing storyline, some lovely visuals and great performances from all concerned. Angel Heart features a stand out performance from Mickey Rourke; a man that made a few good movies in the 80's, and then somewhat and unfortunately disappeared from our screens (although he did have a great little part in 2003's best movie; Once Upon a Time in Mexico). Mickey Rourke creates just the right atmosphere for his character; Harry Angel is from New York, and this is shown by Rourke's thick accent, the man also has a lot of charisma, which is shown in the character. Aside from Rourke, the movie's other stand out performance comes from Robert DeNiro, in a great little turn as the Devil. Robert DeNiro is a fantastic actor, and he really shows it here; with just a small part in the film, DeNiro manages to make a lasting impression. The way he portrays the character of Satan is also pretty close to the mark of what I would expect Satan to be; it's evil, but it's very subtle evil. The Devil in Angel Heart doesn't go round casting spells or killing people, but just his mannerisms alone are enough to make the audience see that the character is evil; and that really is quite frightening. Despite the obvious openings for the movie to be over the top, it isn't. Despite it's several brutal murders, Angel Heart is very restrained and subtle; and that works to its credit. In fact, there's only one real out of the ordinary part in Angel Heart; and that's the part where Lucifer's and the child's eyes change towards the end. The only other thing of that ilk is the demonic ceremony, which isn't shown on screen. Everything else that we see in the movie stays much within the realms of the real world, and that is another frightening aspect of the film. Overall, Angel Heart is a great movie. Its story is interesting and intricate, the acting is fine and it's also very original. All in all; a great film that should be missed by nobody.",600,4,3,False
imdb_angel_heart_barnabyrudge_20060711,Angel Heart,IMDb,barnabyrudge,2006-07-11,5,Very strange thriller with a twist ending that you will either love or hate.,"Alan Parker crafts a weird, absorbing, but ultimately rather silly mystery-thriller with this film. Taken from a novel by William Hjortsberg, and adapted for the screen by Parker himself, this movie undeniably contains its fair share of intriguing moments and ideas, but it stumbles at the very death by providing a twist revelation that stretches all the credibility that has gone before. I know of people who rather like the ending, but in my eyes it just doesn't quite fit. The film unravels as an engrossing and perfectly well-crafted mystery, but the final scene slides off into the realms of Faustian horror and fantasy. It's an ending that you will either love or hate . I hated it. Having said that, there is enough in the earlier sections of the film to admire, and it would be unfair of me to dismiss the whole film simply because the final few minutes don't work in my opinion. In 1955, New York private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by a mysterious client named Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down a missing man. The missing man, a big band singer called Johnny Favorite, seemingly broke the terms of a contract with Cyphre and is now sought by the latter for his deception. Angel quickly establishes that Johnny Favorite went to fight in the Second World War and was severely injured during the fighting. However, Angel also discovers that Johnny was mysteriously taken away from the nursing home where he was under care after the War, and no-one seems quite sure of his present whereabouts. Angel follows a trail of clues to the voodoo community of New Orleans, where he meets poor bayou girl Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) and finds himself lusting after her. Gradually, Angel becomes more and more aware that he is involved in a very sinister mystery indeed, the solution to which may affect him more personally than he could ever imagine. The good points include strong performances by Rourke and De Niro, the former holding the film together with his edgy interpretation of the scruffy, moody hero; and the latter doing well in his handful of scenes as the creepy client. Thrown into the mix are various bloody murders, elements of satanism and occultism and lots of doomy dialogue, none of it remotely convincing although it DOES lend the film a suitably nightmarish atmosphere. Staying on the plus side, Trevor Jones provides a good score which adds a degree of creepiness to the proceedings. On the negative side, Parker gets rather too sidetracked by what he perceives to be the seedier aspects of his film. The violence is deliberately  and excessively  unpleasant, and there's a bizarrely pretentious (and controversial) scene in which Rourke and Bonet have sex, somewhat vigorously, while blood drips down onto them from the ceiling. At 113 minutes, the film feels slightly overlong, or at least certainly too lengthy for this particular story. And the twist ending is a let-down too, as noted already. Angel Heart remains worth watching for its intriguing elements, but on the whole it is a rather flawed film which falls agonisingly short of its potential.",529,6,8,False

Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a two-bit private detective who takes a job that requires him to find a mysterious and famous crooner from the past, named Johnny Favorite. The story, set in 1955 and mostly in New Orleans, is fairly convoluted, with important events taking place a dozen years before 1955. As such, the dialogue contains an enormous amount of exposition, combined with some flashbacks. I think the script could have been improved by including a prologue set in 1943, showing generalized events without giving away plot twists. In so doing, all that exposition could have been avoided. Despite a somewhat weak script, the film veritably oozes heavy atmosphere. Sultry music; interior shadows and muted colors; and those 1950s visuals, with its hairstyles, old cars, and drab clothes combine to create an eerie framework conducive to murder and spiritualism in the bayou country of Louisiana, a delicious cinematic cocktail of mystery and suspense. Nonprofessional actors fill some roles, which heightens a sense of realism, as does the filming of most scenes in real locations instead of built sets. A few scenes are too violent and bloody for my taste, but are mercifully rare. In the role of Harry Angel, former boxer Mickey Rourke gives a really good performance, physical and spontaneous. Indeed, most performances in this film are above average. The script is the film's somewhat weak link.

But ""Angel Heart"" is not like ""Body Heat"" because it follows into other direction, there's some similarities between both films. The mystery here is given to a Brooklyn detective named Harry Angel (Rourke) contacted by a mysterious and sinister man called Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro, in one of his most scariest performances ever) who wants to discover the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, a popular singer who disappeared after the Second World War. Following some strange clues the detective seems to be attracting and adding more and more deaths with individuals involved with this Johnny Favorite. As the usual films noir goes along with mysteries and charades there's also a female companion for the hero, a beautiful girl played by Lisa Bonet, who is involved in the situation and better stop right here without saying why she's important. The plot is incredibly well written, the ending is very satisfying, memorable and before you hold the mystery pieces together you'll see that everything makes sense. But if you can't figure out what happened in the ending go to the IMDb's FAQ and see the story told in order (I understood, but some connections didn't worked quite well, but after looking the FAQ's it was more interesting how the whole thing was made).

I never understood that then and I still don't really now. For me, this is a very stylish and intriguing film that has many good things about it. Its story centres on a Brooklyn private eye who is hired by a mysterious stranger to find a missing singer who owes him a debt. Everywhere he goes a trail of gruesome ritualistic murders follow. The setting is a very big part of the success of the movie and one of the reasons it has aged so well. 1950's Brooklyn, Harlem, Coney Island and Louisiana are all invoked extremely effectively and give the movie a real sense of place and atmosphere. Likewise, specific settings are well used such as the creepy evangelical church in New York or the backwater bayou in New Orleans. Intensifying the feeling is a really effective, haunting jazz soundtrack. All these things combined make for a very potent mood and atmosphere. Director Alan Parker needs to be given a lot of credit here for this. His direction is excellent and the moments of cinematic style he uses are all, not only extremely well executed, but also really effective in building atmosphere and dread. Sometimes it's totally innocuous details like tap dancing feet that are edited in such a way as to signify impending horror, similarly recurring imagery of lifts, fans and staircases are given a somewhat sinister feeling. Other times, the material is much more direct such as the notorious sex scene or the psychological flash-backs that Harry Angel experiences every so often. While little details like the mysterious nun whose face Harry never quite sees are very well integrated and scary. In other words, stylistically Angel Heart is a real success. All of this would be well and good but what takes it up a level further is the fact that the central mystery is very compelling. It has plenty of noirish detail and characters but is given further value by the way it intermingles this with voodoo and jazz music. It makes for a pretty distinctive concoction it has to be said. The production values in general seem very good here and the period detail is never less than completely convincing. The icing on the cake is of course the casting. Mickey Rourke was at the height of his powers at this time and he effortlessly fits the character of Harry Angel. Robert De Niro is very sinister in a slightly unusual role for him. Lisa Bonet is pretty memorable as the girl who Angel dalliances with in New Orleans, while Charlotte Rampling's icy persona is utilised well as a sinister fortune-teller.

The bewildering trail of clues introduces Angel to various pagan rituals in and around New Orleans (including an interlude of voodoo sex with Lisa Bonet), leading finally to a macabre and gruesome conclusion that spoils the moody air of unease by its over-explicit reference to the film's title.

This one has been on my to-watch list for quite some time, and just this week I saw it was up on Amazon Prime. I had no idea what type of movie I'd be diving into, but it delivered and surprised me in a multitude of ways. I do feel the need to mention that Jacob's Ladder is one of my favorite movies of all time, and now that I've seen this, I get the feeling that it was HEAVILY inspired by this film. One of the only other movies that comes to mind which is pretty similar in tone is SEVEN / SE7EN - if you're a huge fan of that movie, you should see this. First of all, cast wise - Mickey Rourke is the perfect wisecracker. Totally lovable though you always feel like he's gonna get himself in trouble. He acts his heart out in this - it's fantastic. I'm pretty sure most people consider it his best acting performance - and I would not argue with that (though I think The Wrestler is a better movie overall). I've never seen DeNiro in a role like this. He's pretty campy but totally sells it, and is fully amusing to watch (and look at). Then, Lisa Bonet...wow, what a goddess! Her presence...so elegant and beautiful, with opportunity to show her primal fierceness as well - I've never seen her like this. It was iconic. On that note, this movie withholds one of the most insane sex scenes I have ever seen... The only things that really stop this from being a perfect film are the floppy tone of it all, the fact that it's so out there it's beyond just requiring a bit of suspension of disbelief, and some specific sequences that visually just don't work. However, fans of pulpy, almost exploitation-style tonality will be very pleased - this movie consistently weaves in and out of campy noir-inspired amusement and bleakly disturbing sequences and imagery. The score throbs and pulses like a living, breathing creature. It's very effective and adds to the surreal atmosphere of this bizarre experience. There is a large amount of disorienting or, at the very least, intriguing shots focused on the eerie environment and surrounding and this manages to do a lot to give the film it's own character. Apparently this movie was rated X upon it's release. I'm thinking it's more so because of certain...themes, rather than purely being visually graphic content.

I wont go too much into the story, but i must say there are plenty of satisfying deaths (though, don't expect anything too gory.. this was made in 1987 after all...), although i'm 14 (and own it on directors edition), i wouldn't suggest young children watch it, because of the overall contents of nudity and a very strong sex scene. I highly suggest anyone with taste for a great movie, which not only twists and turns but will keep you thinking about it, not to mention talking about it, i recommend this movie.

Quite frankly, you'll be too terrified to even move. If anyone has played the excellent Sierra adventure game, ""Gabriel knight: Sins of the Fathers"", you'll see a clear inspiration with this movie. Angel Heart is a nightmare of a film-noir flick with a little of the horror genre mixed in. Truly one of the most involving films I've ever seen and by the end of it, the audience will feel as though they've been taken through Hell. Mickey Rourke plays Harry Angel, a small time private investigator in New York City. Most of his clients are jealous lovers and that sort. Angel gets a call one day by Louis Cyphre, a clergyman of a strange religion, asking him to track down a man who is in dept to him. Angel Heart moves like a detective drama with the pacing. But the film is so much more than just a gather clues and evidence type of thing. There's a real psychological horror that builds up as Angel nears closer and closer to his man and as he begins to question the validity of his employer, Mr. Cyphre. Mickery Rourke is brilliant in the movie. He plays a detestable and dirty chainsmoking hustler who will do almost whatever it takes to find the person he's after. Yet the character is also likable because of Rourke's charm, which allows for us to care about him. Robert DeNiro is creepy and downright disturbing as Louis Cyphre in all his subdued glory. The production is amazing. Angel Heart feels like a dark moody blues and jazz number. The story starts in New York and ends up in New Orleans. Lisa Bonet and Rourke have one of film's most notorious moments, a sex-scene that got her kicked off ""The Cosby Show"" and almost landed the film with an X-rating. Parker's movie ain't for the squimish or faint of heart, that's for sure. Many of the voodoo scenes with chickens are freaky enough, let alone several of the films' gruesome murders. Alan Parker directed the film perfectly. He's vowed to work in every genre and made one hell of a flick with Angel Heart. Michael Seresin did the cinematography for the movie. He also shot Parker's earlier film, Midnight Express. Trevor Jones composed the film's score. Overall just a damn fine piece of movie making. You'll be hard pressed to find a more surreal and nightmarish movie than this with such great acting and storytelling. The ending will leave you gasping for air, yet somehow you will have seen it coming all along. Grade: A+",458,2,2,False

And the discovery that the person he's looking for is not at all dead or brain-dead, as he was lead to believe. The person in question is very alive and well and in full control of his mental facilities. Contacted by a Mr. Winesap, Dann Florek, to take a case of a client of his Angel meets him at this Harlem church that seems to practice Voodoo blood sacrifices instead of Christian ethics. Meeting Winsap together with his really strange and creepy-looking client a Mr. Louis Cyphre, Robert De Niro,makes Angel's blood run cold but when he's offered $5,000.00 for his services, from Cyphre, he immediately agrees to take the job. Told by Cyphre that he's looking for this former night-club and USO crooner a Johnny Favorite aka John Liebing who was badly injured in the last war in the battle of North Africa. Being told by Cyphre that Favorite suffered severe brain damage and was brought back to the states and admitted to this private sanitarium, The Sarah Dodd Harvest Memorial Clinic, outside the town of Poughkeepsie in upstate New York. As Cyphre goes on with his story he tells Angel that it was always believed that Favorite was a patient at the clinic until recently when he went to visit him finding out, now twelve years later in 1955, that he either escaped or was smuggled out of the sanitarium back in 1943 and has never been seen or heard from since. You get a very uncomfortable chill up your spine, like Angel does, when Cyphre tells him that he's looking for Favorite for one and one reason only: to have him pay off a debt that he owes him and get the impression from Cyphre's tone of voice that the debt is to be paid not in money but in blood! Eerie and nerve-racking thriller with Harry Angel trying to track down and find, dead or alive, the very illusive Johnny Favorite with the leads he comes up with in his investigation back in NYC has Angel traveling to New Orleans. Tracking down the daughter of Mrs. Proudfoot, Johnny Favorite's lover in New Orleans during the war, 17 year-old Epiphany, Lisa Bonet, Angel gets involved with a number of strange and terrifying Voodoo cults. It turns out that Epiphany, like her late mom, is a high Voodoo priestess. The involvement with Epiphany and her fellow cultists results in Angel being hit or exposed to some kind of Voodoo hex that drives him to the brink of insanity if not beyond it. As Angel slowly uncovers the mystery of just who this Johnny Favorite really is and if he's still alive everyone he comes in contact with in his investigation ends up brutally murdered in what seems like a number of blood curdling and gruesome Voodoo rituals. Angel finally gets to the bottom of what all this Johnny Favorite business really is all about when he gets in touch with a Mr. Ethan Kursemark,Stocker Fontelieu, who like his late daughter Margaret, Charlotte Rampling,is an expert as well as practitioner of the Black Arts. It was Margaret who Angel first got in contact with in New Orleans that resulted, from her talking to him, in her murder where her heart was ripped out of her body! It's after his talk with Ethan, and later with Cyphre himself, that Angel realizes the real reason why he was picked by Cyphre to investigate Johnny Favorites strange disappearance in that he himself had a lot to do with it! As the shocking truth about Angel's strange connection to Favorite comes out from his subconscious mind Angel loses it ending up mumbling to, and trying to convince, himself that it's all just a bad dream or nightmare, as the movie ends, but knowing full well deep down and in his soul that it's Not!

Based on William Hjortsberg's landmark novel, A private investigator (Harry Angel) is hired by an enigmatic client to seek out an equally enigmatic and elusive crooner. This takes the detective on a Chandler-esque journey from New York to New Orleans where he encounters a host of strange and colourful characters. This may just be Mickey Rourke's finest hour. His movie star charisma and acting chops are at their peak. He goes toe to toe with De Niro and even emerges the winner. Imbuing the character with a tough guy charm and an endearing vulnerability, it's hard not to root for Harry, even if the game is rigged against him. Director Alan Parker really captures the spirit of New Orleans. The city is very much a character in the film and not just a pretty backdrop. (New York too for that matter.) Michael Seresin's cinematography is moody and highly evocative. The scrore by Trevor Jones is spooky and darkly sensual. Even though there may be flaws in the story-line and the twist may seem obvious or far-fetched, it doesn't mar the enjoyment of the film. In fact, Angel Heart only improves on repeated viewings.

And I call myself a horror fan...anyhows, lets get to the point. This film is awesome! Its great! And I'm really, really glad that I saw it. Robert Deniro and Mickey Rourke, it cant be all that bad right? Right! The story is about a private detective called Harry who is called upon by a man called Louis Cypher to look for another man called Favorite that disappeared many years ago and owes him something. Harry needing the money takes the job and starts to investigate who this guy 'favorite' is and what he did. The journey takes him deep into the heart of voodoo, new Orleans and devil worship! Alan Parker has delivered a truly dark film. I was impressed by the look and feel of the movie which is one of its strongest assets. The film starts out in Los Angeles, kind of like a film noirish dark alley smoke coming out of the streets, fans blowing in the summer heat type of place. Thing is, the movie only gets darker and darker... the deeper Harry is to uncovering the mystery, the darker the film gets. Everything is dirty and steamy. Hot, wet and bloody. As you can see I absolutely loved the visual aspect of this film. But what about its performances? Well Mickey Rourke is the main star here and he delivers the goods. In fact, I think Ill say that this is definitely one of his best -if not the best performance- of his life. The last frames of this film display that this is truly one of the best actors who's sort of disappeared into nowhere. I certainly I'm looking forward to his next film. Lisa Bonet delivers another great performance, too bad she is also hardly ever seen. And speaking of seeing Lisa Bonet...for those of you guys out there with a hard on for her, check this movie out! I think she was only like 18 or something when she did it! But damn it there's a steamy sex scene in which she goes all the way with Rourke and its sexy as hell. Now we understand why Lenny Kravitz wrote all those love songs for her. But get this the scene is not only steamy...its artistic as hell! Once you see the dance of blood that goes on in these sequences well you will be impressed as well, Parker here shows complete domain over using visuals as art. And then there's Deniro. He is good as always...but on this film, the role he plays gives you a real nice chill down your spine. First off he looks menacing as hell with his goatee and his long hair and those long fingernails. He has got this deadly serious tone to him, you don't want to mess with this guy, every word that he spits out sounds threatening. The delivery of his dialog is excellent. Also my hats of to Alan Parker for writing an excellent screenplay. The atmosphere on this film never lets off. Even if the movie starts out in a big city landscape...its a dark and shadowy big city! Then it moves to the bayou in New Orleans and things really start to cook up. Right down to the moment where we witness a real life Voodo Dance ceremony. Alan Parker is a great director, heck who wasn't moved and shocked by Midnight Express? With Angel Heart I really think he delivered yet another great film which should certainly rank way up there among his best films ever. Basically, this movie took me by surprise and I enjoyed every second of it. Its a mystery that you will want to devour slowly. Like a delicious meal that you just want to really savor.

About two years ago I had been flipping through stations on TV and stopped on a movie with Mickey Rourke and a bearded Robert De Niro. Already I was hooked, but it wasn't just the presence of these two actors that had me watching, it was the look and feel of the film. Considering I had only caught the last ten minutes of the movie, I was completely engrossed. But it wasn't until earlier this year that I was finally able to sit through the entire movie. The story of Angel Heart is one of noir essence accompanied by overwhelming dread. It begins in 1950's New York, with Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), a low class gumshoe with quite a low prolific career. In his office, he gets a call from a potential client's lawyer, asking him to meet him in of all places, a Harlem church. The client in question is Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro), a mysterious figure who offers Harry a case: Find Johnny Favourite, a war veteran and jazz singer who went missing after returning from the war.. This seemingly simplistic case takes Angel from the roughness of New York to the steamy bayous of New Orleans. As he investigates Favourite's disappearance, he finds himself in the middle of something far more sinister than he ever suspected. As a through-back to the detective thrillers of the 40's and 50's, Angel Heart takes us to places that weren't often traveled in thrillers of the 80's. We're taken to the backwoods of Louisiana where locals practice Voodoo, jazz clubs where classic sounds are still new, and seedy motels that make alleys look like suites at the Ritz-Carlton. There aren't many clean places in the film and it rains in nearly every scene. Writer-director Alan Parker creates a world where only the noir exists and darkness is constant. But this is not a genre film in the conventional sense. Parker keeps most of the story within the nostalgic South and even adds Satanism to the mix. Eventually, the movie begins to completely turn away from its noir roots and becomes surrealistic horror. In what can be called a virtuoso performance, Mickey Rourke gives Angel a perfect glibness that makes his journey all the more surprising. Balancing pompousness with certain professional drive, Rourke perfectly captures a down and out gumshoe. Sharing his every scene with Rourke, De Niro shines in a purposely understated role. As Cyphre, De Niro is at his most stoic and creepy in only a few scenes. At the time of its release, the real interest of the movie came in the appearance of then Cosby Kid Lisa Bonet. As the gorgeous but mysterious Epiphany Proudfoot, she gives an against type performance that showed its power by getting her fired on the role that made her famous. The sex scene that most scarred her innocent persona is anything but sexy and is something you have to see for yourself. For me though, the ultimate standout of the film's legacy lies in the brilliant cinematography by Michael Seresin. In terms of capturing a film's visuals with its atmosphere, Seresin's photography is some of the best I've seen in the horror genre or any other. Along with Seresin, Parker uses another one of his regulars, Trevor Jones, to create the perfectly toned music for the film. Angel Heart is a prime example of a filmmaker creating a perfectly envisioned piece of work. Everything about the movie fits the genre to a perfect pitch and follows its dark visage to the very end. Criminally underrated at the time of its release, its finally found an audience ever since its release on DVD, and rightfully so.

Both genres in a way have similar elements, with horror there is always that touch of mystery as the protagonists don't know what danger their dealing with; and with noir the protagonist/s their hunt the truth puts them in constant danger of becoming the hunted. There was also not that many in the subgenre of horror at the time, from TV shows like ""The X-Files"" and the graphic comic series ""Constantine: Hellblazer""; this film in a way sort of predates both of them, heck the film's story could of easily of been a spin off story within the world of the ""Hellblazer"" comic series. The cinematographic and the production is great. The film is sort of a period piece as it's set in the 1950's and we see a version of Brooklyn and New Orleans and everything in them from a time long gone, the cars, building structures and even styles all to a tee. But I also like how the film really creates this foreboding atmosphere, from the beginning where we see Brooklyn enveloped in darkness and cold, which not just invokes the throwback feel to the noirs but also an almost supernatural sense as you feel there is something unnatural about this darkness as if a force of evil has it's hands on the city and all the creatures that stir within it's sight. There is also the grim and grit you see throughout this as we see in some locations it looks as though the interior and exterior of them look like places that have seen better days. As well as in some places there are some strange and unfamiliar decorations around. This not just adds to the atmosphere but also helps present a world where there is danger at every turn or shadow, but also how nothing is what it seems. The music is excellent, the music is done by one of my favorite movie composers Trevor Jones. Really like how some of the score seems to be a mix of some of the saxophone, piano but also just eerie somber tunes that really reflect the mix of both genres. But really give the film the feeling of danger as well as mystery. The characters are pretty good, Mickey Rourke whom at the time looked like Bruce Willis, he's an underrated actor and this to me is probably my favorite role from him. His character Harry Angel is a likeable protagonist and somewhat sympathic. He's the typical old-fashioned detective from the noirs of yesteryear. But I like that he's charismatic he's got a lot of good lines like my favorite is ""today is Wednesday, it's anything can happen day"" that I've always believed is true and that's my day from my astrological personal profile. But there are some emotional layers to his character as he's a man that has been worn down from the war, even his own occupation and residence as he's seen so much or too much all around him. He's a guy that's on the loner side, he's not a person that has big dreams though he might have once, he's more a person that is always looking for something in life anything. Unfortunate he might find more than he bargained for. Robert De Nero is just excellent as Louis Cyphere whom despite not being in the film that much, he really invokes a great presence throughout beginning to end. The scenes when he's there are just excellent. I really love how his character just has this sharp calm charisma to him which makes him likeable. But he's enigmatic, hence his last name Cyphere, you can see from some of the dialogue and in his eyes this guy knows more than he's letting on. There is also you sense something sinister and unsettling about him, there is one scene where he then makes a religious reference about the egg representing the soul and then suddenly eats it but maintains a stare at the main protagonist. I'll admit that scene gave me a small chill as it seems like he's eating Harry's soul. But what really drives this film is in the thought provoking and constant developing mystery and suspense. Throughout the film Harry and ourselves are just going from one place to another, one thing leads to another. As we get much deeper in the mystery things just get more intriguing and even stranger, which results in more questions than answers. From some quick clips of a flashback on Harry's experiences we wonder how is Harry's past connected with the current case or even the identity dark mysterious figure in what looks like black funerary outfit with a heavy black veil we see in spots throughout the film. I even like how throughout the film you see Harry is always looking into the mirror, he always has that same look which asks the same question ""who are you?"" this is the same question we start to ask latter in the film. The suspense in the film is great as we get deeper into the mystery, our sense of doom and dread grows more and more. Everything that Harry and we find out or occurring are all adding all up to something, but we know in the back of our mind that it's not good. What makes this all the scarier is that it may already be too late to escape. I really like how religion comes into play in this film, all three of them to be exact from voodoo, satanism, and Christianity. In a way all three of them have one think in common which is in the pursuit of truth, a higher one that exists. But I like that the film in a way is a bit of a Christian film, as we do see the Christian faith along with a familiar figure come into play in the film. And there is a little them about sin and how it can really destroy people just as it destroyed some of the people Harry interviewed. Or people that have tempted fate or messed with powers beyond their own control and eventually payed the price. And of course, it comes down to the twist reveal which I'll admit was something I honestly didn't see coming a mile away. However, what really makes this revelation even more powerful and scary is that it all makes sense. Beware in your pursuit of whatever truth you seek, it could cost you your soul.

This was a rather fun entry, though there's some definite problems with it. One of the main issues here is the rather convoluted manner in which the entire mystery is found out, which tends to run all over the place and features a lot of extraneous parts that really could've been streamlined over time as the investigation seems to go on forever without really coming to any real conclusion in most cases, being told rather than fully investigated. That said, the rest of the film is quite enjoyable with a thoroughly involving mystery that needs to be sorted out, a rather potent mixture of black magic and voodoo which creates a nasty atmosphere, an intense and ultimately shocking sex scene thrown in and a rather shocking twist that ends the whole affair nicely.

""Angel Heart"" is that kind of a movie. It doesn't make much sense until you look back on it. While at this time, the pieces fit together, it hampers the enjoyment of actually watching the film. One might argue that it would work better on a second viewing, but at least in my opinion, it's not worth it. Harry Angel (a very young Mickey Rourke) is called by Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down a man named Johnny Favorite. While on the case, Harry discovers that he really had no idea what he was getting himself into. The acting varies. Mickey Rourke is terrific as Angel, although the script has him act irrationally in some cases. He's a guy we can immediately root for. I don't know why Robert DeNiro's part was labeled as a ""Special Appearance."" His part is more than an cameo; in fact, he has the most screen time next to Rourke (although Rourke is in every scene). Lisa Bonet is rather flat here, although she can attract sympathy like no one else. My complaints about ""Angel Heart"" would be minor if the film was suspenseful, scary, or for that matter, interesting. Unfortunately, it is none of those things. I spent the whole time wondering what the hell was going on. Not exactly the kind of response you want from a viewer. The approach (the film will only work when it is pieced together after the credits have begun to roll)that director Alan Parker took with the project is not a bad idea from the get-go. Unfortunately, Parker is unable to keep the audience very involved, and that's a big problem. ""Angel Heart"" has been described as a cult film.

In unexplainable situations the body dies but the soul is unprepared. For some reason the soul needs a guide to help it find its way home to reach the logical conclusion. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0bYEey2ztQ This is a video about reaching truth of society for political power. Robert Deniro plays the character of the angel of the lord our God sent down from heaven. His mission is to reveal the truth to a human soul which is misguided. By his guidance the truth is revealed. Although painful human nature is shown its reward by its actions. Since Robert DeNiro is supposedly Jewish I often wonder if he also studies the Jewish Kabbalh. This is also a concept to reach enlightenment and truth of human society. This is free and only requirement is to have an open mind and open heart. According to my research Hasidism, based in the Kabbalh, became popular around the turn of the 18th Century which also stressed dance and music. As symbols have been often used music may have been interpreted as a truly logical and creative eloquence that is universal among people. Some people have different senses of logic to determine which music is the best. The screams of pain and suffering, rejoice song, religious belief song, drums and trumpets of ancient warfare, laughter and other emotions. Natural verse electronic. Obviously in this film prefers natural saxophone music similar to a natural trumpet mouth. Again the main theme is for the soul to reach truth, enlightenment, and or peace. Its not very peaceful to find out that the screams of pain and suffering is a desirable aspect of the investigation, even though they are naturally made by the mouth of a human soul. I think the human soul has a universal sound in elation such as laughter, crying, pain, happiness. Why Lucifer prefers the natural course seems to entice a hatred of the concept of Satan, but similar to the concept presented in Dantes'Inferno. Although Dantes' Infernio could be more related into an investigation of feudalism, monarchy, administrative corruption by human vices. Which were more of the era of Orthodox Christian thought. Since this film deals with eggs, being a symbol of the soul, and as Satan devours one explaining his orders for the investigation. Perhaps it is something Satan desires as well found in the musical essence as a survival tactic. Partly because Satan desires payment of this soul, and partly because Satan is being responsible, but would like to keep something which seems to be the ethical vice in natural music to further distinguishes his evil presence in the eye of the public. Or in this case the viewer of public censorship concerning the evil of man embodied in Satan as generally perceived by the public. I discovered the secret of royalty despite this film about the Pagan Occult with the innocence of a child. Its not the hand that guides the sword for a true leader, but the mind that guides the motives of society. Hence the orb in the left hand and sword in the right of a seated ruler. The orb could be seeds, medicine, or other knowledge condensed for the transfer into society by the ruler. As in the movie James Bond in Octopussy the Russian usage of eggs may symbolize seeds of the population or fertility ornately by jewels.

imdb_angel_heart_gab_14712_20201017,Angel Heart,IMDb,gab-14712,2020-10-17,8,Twisty Thriller from Alan Parker!,"Alan Parker's Angel Heart is a weird, creepy psychological thriller. This is my second time viewing this picture. The first time, I did not really think much of it and found it rather dull. I was young at the time and didn't know what to expect. Years later, I do appreciate the movie just a little more. I found the pacing to be trying at certain points, but an interesting story and exemplary performances from Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro kept me captivated enough. The film did not get much love upon initial release, but it did gain a cult following as the years went on. This film reminded me of an old noir but with a supernatural twist added. It certainly had the grimy atmosphere, the slimy characters, and the mysterious settings we associate with this genre. The film's ending is often talked about. It received mixed reactions, but I was satisfied with the ending as the movie went deep into supernatural territory. The film was directed by Alan Parker who always go all out in his movies. The man made it a mission to dip his toes in different genres. He tackles two genres here: the supernatural thriller and the private eye detective story ala Chinatown. While not as striking nor memorable as his powerful Midnight Express, Parker was able to put his directorial and screenwriting skills to work. The screenplay is based on the popular novel from William Hjortsberg. Hjortsberg wanted to sell the movie rights to the big studios but was denied because they did not like the bleak, dark ending. That was unfortunate at first because John Frankenheimer was ready to direct and Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford were in talks to star. Not even star power could convince the studio bigwigs to finance the project. Eventually, Parker got involved and was able to finance the film under an independent studio. One of my favorite things about the movie is its location shoots. More than 80 different locations. Many of the filming locations, including the place of the devil-worship cult, took place in Harlem. Parker wanted to film in locations that had hardly been seen in cinema. With blessing from Hjortsberg, he also decided to film in New Orleans (despite not being in the book) because of association with a voodoo cult. That is also where the sex scene with Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet was filmed and that scene made the headlines because that scene made the MPAA slap the entire movie with a X-rating, which is not a viable rating for moneymaking. Parker had to do some careful editing to earn its R. Compared to what we see in today's film, that scene is nearly disappointing. Cool bloody raindrops though. It's New York City in the year 1955. Private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by a very mysterious, well-groomed man named Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro). Angel is unaware who Cyphre is but Cyphre makes clear he chose Angel for a reason. His mission is to locate the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, who has not been seen since after World War 2 ended. As the case progresses, Angel feels like he is losing his mind. His leads take him to seedy folks and most of all, he does not trust Cyphre. Will Angel be able to complete the case with his sanity intact? The film thrives thanks to Parker's skillful directing and excellent performances. Rourke is at his best here with his unkempt looks. Parker had to woo De Niro but it worked. De Niro dresses sharply and makes a neat antagonist to Rourke. Of course, he is heavily involved in the film's famous ending. Also, Lisa Bonet! It was a wise decision to prove her acting skills before she became heavily involved with The Cosby Show. That casting choice proved to be a little controversial considering the subject matter. On the whole, Angel Heart takes a page out of the noir thrillers from old and adds some supernatural elements to spice things up. I was one of those who enjoyed the ending but leading up to the ending was a little bit of a chore. Parker took his time which allowed the pacing to be slow. The film is tightly edited, and I enjoyed the jazzy score from Trevor Jones. The film may not be a heavy punch, but its worth watching Alan Parker step his toe in this genre.

Built first and foremost as neo-noir, it increasingly lays on the atmosphere in minute but perfect ways. The music does a lot of the heavy lifting, from blues tunes and contemporary pop that belie seedy goings-on, to Trevor Jones' outstanding, greatly varied score that pointedly maintains and elevates the tension and disquiet. Disturbing imagery and visions flash more and more before our eyes and those of protagonist Harry, fraying his nerves as his investigation deepens alongside the stack of bloodied bodies. Especially with these other facets as foundation, even Alan Parker's shot composition seems to lend to the unease as some plainly beautiful imagery looms large over characters who seem so small in comparison. The subtle, gnawing sense of horror gradually becomes more dominant in the latter half, culminating in the last small stretch in which all the dark truths of the story come to bear. I had mixed expectations before I sat to watch, borne from divided opinions I had loosely gathered, but at length I'm so pleased with just how good this is. I don't think it's perfect, but overall I love 'Angel Heart,' and I'm sorry it took me so long to get around to it. To be upfront, there's one specific flaw that I think weighs considerably on the picture at an inopportune moment. Throughout these nearly two hours the tone is soft and understated, punctuated by sparing and deliberate instances of violence or greater intensity. That low-key tenor is what makes this work so well as it does - and it's very unfortunate that in contrast, the last few minutes are tawdrily heavy-handed. I take no issue at all with the scene writing, or the broad thrust of the dialogue, both of which are crucial to resolving the tale in the delicious manner that it does. One or two specific lines, however, and even more so a couple small post-production effects laid in as embellishments, do not come off well, and frankly they just look hokey. One last subdued scene, playing out over the end credits, returns us to that tack that the title otherwise sustains, only further spotlighting the gawkiness of what we're given in the last minutes. With a few miniscule adjustments, this could have been pretty much flawless. With that said, though, it speaks so well to all involved that 'Angel Heart' is otherwise so excellent, and that I'm hard-pressed to think of any other criticism. Anyone who has ever enjoyed a noir feature will recognize the overall look and feel here as the narrative follows private detective Harry Angel, tasked with finding the whereabouts of a musician and stumbling down a rabbit hole in the process. Genuinely all the characters here are rather fascinating in their complications, and I'd love to know more about all of them. Even the dialogue is rich and flavorful, to say nothing of the scene writing that's filled with tremendous detail in piecing the story together and providing fuel for all the grim airs of the course of events. Sure, Parker was working from William Hjortsberg's novel, but his screenplay is truly splendid - and his direction is no less solid, capitalizing on the the general sinister vibes to keep the proceedings comparatively muted yet buzzing while feeding us just enough concrete nastiness and plot development to grab us anew again and again. With this firmly in mind, I could hardly be happier with the performances that the cast turned in, likewise embracing the spirit of the movie. Even those in smaller supporting parts unquestionably have their time to shine, including Charlotte Rampling, Brownie McGhee, and Michael Higgins, yet there's no mistaking who the stars are. Mickey Rourke slips so easily into the lead role that it's hard to separate part and player, not least he obviously bears a much younger visage here than in those titles of more recent years that have earned him substantial acclaim (e.g., 'The wrestler'). And Rourke is nearly upstaged by Lisa Bonet, whose portrayal of Epiphany is so wonderfully dynamic and wholehearted as she swings from sweet and demure to far more charged and electrifying. It's not for nothing that Bonet got noticed for her acting in this, and frankly I think she deserved more recognition. And one would be remiss not to mention the terrific stunts, art direction that splits its time between gnarly, rustic, and fetching, and practical effects that invariably catch one's attention. Really, in most every capacity, 'Angel Heart' is all-around super. It's regrettable that those imperfections show up as and when they do - though in the grand scheme of things, they seem so little relative to how good the film is otherwise. By and large this is marvelous, a brilliantly compelling noir mystery that grows twisted into fabulously fun horror. For any number of reasons this won't appeal to all comers, but I think the patient mix of genres yields strong very strong results, and I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to watch. If that mix sounds interesting to you in any measure, I can only give 'Angel Heart' my very high recommendation, and it's well worth checking out!",872,1,2,False

Finding Fortune is proving problematic for Harry and this is not helped by people connected to the investigation turning up dead after being murdered in varied gruesome ways. His investigation eventually takes him to New Orleans where the trail takes a very unexpected and sinister turn. Rourke is fantastic as Harry Angel and really exercises his acting chops here. De Niro absolutely relishes the role of Mr Cyphre. I was an enormous fan of Rourke's in the 1980's, he really was drop dead gorgeous in those days. Parker creates an authentic 1950's New York and the steamy heat of New Orleans just about rolls off the screen. The cinematography is superb and the soundtrack is great.",188,1,2,False

It is an acid trip inside of an acid trip. I was horrified and in awe at the same time. Some of the scenes that contain the most gore and grossness truly capture the aim of the film. The aim of the film is to show that if you screw with evil, you will get screwed in the end. While I was supremely sickened by the ""climax"" of the film, I loved the ""twisted"" story and the terrific acting. Robert De Niro always had a way with playing the bad guy. I can see why he was picked for his role in ""Meet The Parents."" Overall, Alan Parker succeeded in making a noteworthy film despite depending upon one's opinion of it. For me, Angel Heart fits into the catergory of good movies that will make your skin crawl. This is a movie worth some praise despite how sacreligious it is. I give it an 8 out of 10.

imdb_angel_heart_el_nodate,Angel Heart,IMDb,El,NULL,8,"Pervert, graphic, disturbing ... I loved it ...","Emulating many non-American filmmakers and American movies' admirers, such as Melville, Polanski or Kurosawa, the British Alan Parker ended up making the best tribute to the movies that nourished his cinematic dreams: a film noir. In '78, Parker proved his value as an atmospheric director with the nightmarish ""Midnight Express"", but only in the reverse year of '87, he could fully express his personal skills, because of the very requirements of the genre. Indeed, whether you expect a detective story or a horror/thriller, the result has to be highly atmospheric, and in the case of ""Angel Heart"", the epithet is a huge understatement. The film opens in January 1955, with Mickey Rourke, as a down-at-heel and down-to-earth Brooklyn detective, charming with ladies, cynical at times, but never failing to look sympathetic. On that level, Rourke embodies his role like a successor of Bogie and Brando tailor-made for the 80's. His co-star, not the least, is Robert De Niro as a sinisterly suave rich man, holding a cane under pointing fingernails and a heavy thick beard that makes him look like the evil twin of Martin Scorsese. The film is also stars Lisa Bonet, taking a risky, yet effective, departure from the family-oriented Cosby Show. The beginning feels like a faithful reminiscence of hard-boiled Raymond Chandler's stories, with the typical dark and shadowy shots of New York's streets, until it suddenly takes us to a creepy journey into a weird devil-worship and voodoo-culture in New Orleans. In the process, Angel Heart reveals his fear of chickens and avoidance of mirrors that make his presence in New Orleans even more uncomfortable. His interactions with Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) are effectively creepy but De Niro finds the right note in his performance, keeping so much coolness in a rather hot setting that we never give a second thought about his name. Angel's mission is to find a crooner and WWII veteran named Johnny Favorite, who has an old business to settle with Cyphre. Angel goes to the hospital where Favorite is supposed to be cured from shell-shock, and finds out from the morphine-addict doctor that the records have been falsified to let a man and a woman take Favorite to the South. Locking the doctor without morphine, Angel expects more information, but when he comes back, the doctor strangely turned into a corpse, all signs indicating it was quite a brutal murder. This is the starter of a series of fresh corpses punctuating Angel's track, and pointing the same accusing finger on him. Cyphre meets a reluctant Angel again and accepts to pay him 5000 dollars to find Favorite's new whereabouts in New Orleans. Angel gets in touch with all the persons who knew Favorite, professionally and privately, from a musician to a fortune teller played by Charlotte Rampling, but the closer he gets to the truth, using his street-smarts and occasionally his way with ladies, the more enemies he makes. He tries to contact Favorite's secret love, only to find out that she's dead, leaving her only child, Epiphany Proudfoot, Bonet as a precocious 17-year old mother. A strange relationship grows with a disturbing smell of deviation, peaking at the infamous love scene. Naturally, Alan Parker indulges himself to the most gruesome details like during the frenetic sex scene, when pours of rains turn into blood, as to suggest a disturbing correlation between sex and violence, as if both were the rotten fruits of the same evil tree. The sordid details don't shock either because the religious undertones that fill the story make them strangely acceptable. The merit of the disturbing voodoo-scene where an entranced Bonet slits a chicken's throat and hysterically dance with her blood-covered face is to desensitize us enough to the sight of blood to handle the ultimate confrontation. So it comes to this, ""Angel Heart"" is a film of heavy, threatening and nightmarish atmosphere, a sort of dead-trap no one can get away from it, not even Angel, and this is why the conclusion was the only satisfying one, it does provide disturbing answers but we never discuss their plausibility because we had already been plunged in that supernatural universe, made of animal sacrifices, creepy talismans, smelly herbs and heart-pounding cries. And the ending makes the cinematography's point, by highlighting the curse of a humanity carrying evil germs in its dirty womb, from the sordid streets of New York to the dirty swamps of the Bayou. ""Angel Heart"" has often been praised for being a mix of ""Chinatown"" and ""The Exorcist"", but in its own way, Alan Parker recreated the 50's more realistically than Polanski's treatment of the 30's, and with its predominance of black and red, some details gets even scarier than ""The Exorcist"", I'm thinking of the sex scene with Lisa Bonet that even rivals with the infamous crucifix moment. Visually speaking, the film is a spectacular masterpiece showing how far a director can pushes the button of morbidity, almost having fun with it. And to keep on the religious vocabulary, the film is blessed with magnificent cities and stairs shot, working as a true homage of German expressionist cinema, making the color feel like it's black and white. And God, there is Rourke's performance that even surpasses De Niro during the mind-blowing last minute. Both Angel's coming-to-realization and your own understanding of ""Angel Heart"", cut straight to yours, literally. And I have goose bumps remembering his raspy scream and his repeated denial ""I know who I am"". Why, one thing you sure is, Mickey is one hell of an actor, and your performance as Angel, proves it. The most memorable shot of ""Angel Heart"" is of an old Otis elevator cage interminably descending into an unknown destination and while watching the film, I had the feeling I was the one trapped in that cage with Alan Parker as a sadistic bellboy grinning at the anticipation of what I would find when the door opens.",990,0,3,False

imdb_angel_heart_yusufpiskin_20200401,Angel Heart,IMDb,yusufpiskin,2020-04-01,8,"""Mise-en-scène""","Stylish, steamy Southern Noir that ups sticks early on, leaving behind the shadows of the city for the slow heat of the Louisiana bayous, where the gumbo is always on the boil, voodoo is in the air and life moves at its own pace. Into this mix comes Brooklyn PI, Harry Angel; a small-time investigator with a hot missing persons case on his hands. The mysterious Johnny Favorite disappeared 12 years earlier with a debt to pay and Angel's client has decided it's time to settle his account. The film isn't without its faults - some of the supporting acting is pretty wooden, the script isn't exactly an exercise in subtlety (Louis Cyphre? Cummon now) and I could see a lot of the twists coming from a ways off - but one thing Alan Parker really excels at is style. So much style! He never misses a beat, with the pitch black shadows crawling across hyper-stylized sets, hard-boiled attitude in the DNA of a skittish jazz soundtrack whose saxophones bubble away darkly in the background, occasionally boiling over at the critical juncture. Aesthetically, this is Neo Noir done right. Mickey Rourke is good in the lead role too, dishevelled and underhand but roguishly charming with it; there's something of the John Constantine about Harry Angel - a dark-hearted antihero trailing a helix of cigarette smoke behind him on his way down to hell.",233,0,3,False
imdb_angel_heart_fernandoschiavi_20220513,Angel Heart,IMDb,fernandoschiavi,2022-05-13,8,NULL,"Bringing a dark atmosphere and mixing mystical elements with the traditional structure of suspense thrillers, Alan Parker creates a classic on the genre In 1955 New York City, private detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by mysterious client Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to find a singer, known as Johnny Favorite, who has been missing for twelve years. The problem is that the more you delve into the investigation, the more confused Harry becomes getting involved with strange people, who curiously die soon after coming in contact with him. On this journey, Harry will discover a mystical world and find a path of no return. When he wrote his masterpiece in 1978, William Hjortsberg was already envisioning a film version. He developed the script and tried to sell it to various studios, with the help of producer Richard Sylbert. Paramount was an interesting option for a big-screen version, directed by John Frankenheimer and starring rising actor Dustin Hoffman. But, the producer dodged the project, as well as the others involved, making the author raise the question: ""Why can't we have a happy ending? "". In 1985, it was producer Elliott Kastner's turn to imagine an adaptation, taking the theme to Alan Parker for Pinewood Studios. Parker saw potential there, but sat down with Hjortsberg to discuss necessary changes, even involving the setting - not just New York, but taking advantage of the occultism of New Orleans; and the ideal year would be 1955, rather than 1959, a period considered more optimistic by Americans. Some changes were made, and the script was in the sole control of Parker, who gave the required melancholy touch as he had done in The Midnight Express (1978). In addition to the fans, you can see Harry Angel's heartbeat in extreme situations, the blurred mirror and the always descending in the elevator, symbolizing his walk to Hell. The characterization of Robert De Niro is obvious as the name of his character, but it would not be necessary to hide his identity because the intention is to disturb the viewer, showing that his only basis of trust is the Fallen Angel. De Niro builds a solid foundation for the protagonist, with a diabolical acting, without stereotyping his Louis Cyphre beyond the looks. Lisa Bonet also surprises with her ingenuity and seductive charisma, different from her comic roles until then. However, Satanic Heart would not have the necessary expressive force if the anti-hero were someone other than Mickey Rourke. A sex symbol at the time, Rourke still had an attractive face and was remembered for the eroticism of 9 1/2 Weeks of Love (1986). His portrayal changes incredibly in proportion to his character's fall, demanding extreme and compelling emotions. Later he would go on to make Wild Orchid (1989) and action movies, while he destroyed his face from the wounds acquired in his boxing career, much like Johnny Favorite, driving his profile into obscurity. Satanic Heart received many negative reviews at the time, condemning the production to cult status. Some said that it didn't define itself between thriller, film noir and supernatural horror - as if the mixture of subgenres was something not very well digested. There are mysteries to be discovered, but they are shrouded in absolute, uncomfortable, and degrading evil. Tension sequences and profusion of blood are some of the ingredients of this ritual orchestrated by Alan Parker for William Hjortsberg's recipe. And the result could only be depressing, pessimistic and extremely satisfying. The film never appeals to the soundtrack or repulsive monsters that leap across the screen as a way of instilling fear in the viewer. Its merit lies in the excellent script and the firmness with which Alan Parker conducts the narrative, using his category as a director to create a stylish look, leading the viewer to discover together with the protagonist the tragic fate that he will inevitably find. During this intriguing journey, we will be enveloped by a dark and macabre atmosphere, filled with shocking images and, what's better, presented with an incredibly surprising ending. From the dark beginning, on a dirty street where a cat looks at the body of a dead man, the obscure and excellent photography (Directed by Michael Seresin) creates a dark and macabre atmosphere, which will extend throughout the narrative. Note the number of times the scene is lit only by the gap in the fans, which appear constantly and refer to the moment when Johnny steals Harry's life inside a hotel, as if they were making a point of reminding him of something he apparently forgot. In addition, whenever they appear, the fans have the narrative function of indicating the next murder. The great art direction by Armin Ganz and Kristi Zea transports the viewer to the year 1955, through the dirty look of the city, the old cars and the old houses, besides, of course, counting on the great costumes by Aude Bronson-Howard and the excellent soundtrack by Trevor Jones that abuses the blues, typical music of the period and the region of New Orleans. All this good technical work helps director Alan Parker to create absolutely striking scenes with an incredible visual impact, highlighting the macabre ritual involving dancing and the death of a chicken, and the sex scene between Harry and Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet), bathed in rainwater that turns to blood and filled with terrifying images. In addition to these scenes, it is worth mentioning that all the deaths are also very realistic and prove the care with the visual on the part of the director. It's also interesting to note how hints of the surprising ending are scattered throughout Alan Parker's own excellent script, such as the fact that all people die when they get involved with Harry. Notice how Louis Cyphre (in English, put the names together and it sounds like Lucifer) calls himself a foreigner (well, hell doesn't stay in the US until proven otherwise) and ironically presents himself on top of a church, saying that his Johnny Favorite's contract would only be executed after his death and claiming to have helped his career, which is quite logical and coherent. At another point, he says that in some tribes the egg symbolizes the soul and then devours the egg, symbolizing what he would do with Harry's soul in the future. Even so, the clever script is subtle enough not to allow the viewer to discover Harry's true identity until the spectacular moment it is revealed. Even Harry himself experiences a series of situations that signal his destiny, such as when he discovers a macabre altar inside the church where he met Louis. Also note how children and animals (especially chickens, but also dogs) do not like Harry, perhaps because they see his true and unbeautiful nature. Children cry at the sight of him, while animals attack. Also note that all the deaths that happen were carried out by the detective when Favorite's mind was awakening. That's why the fans changed direction, representing the other personality, controlled by Lucifer, committing his crimes. As stated above, the moment of sex is Angel's ultimate descent into hell, as he commits a deplorable act of incest without even knowing it. The dark environment in which the plot takes place seems to belong to a nightmare, where all the actions taken by the protagonist seem to lead to a new path, even more tortuous than the previous one. With each discovery of Harry, the viewer is even more intrigued and finds himself eager for the resolution of the investigation. The closer the detective gets to the truth, the more fearful the spectator becomes, practically sensing Harry Angel's tragic fate. And the final revelation, ironic and absolutely shocking, is of a unique genius, the kind that makes you want to see the film again as soon as the credits begin to roll on the screen, as Harry descends in the elevator and finds himself in his private hell. Alan Parker, from ""Midnight Express"", a master at building absurdly oppressive climates without technical frills, sets a disturbing tone that gradually takes on nightmare contours, with his impenetrable logic and his sense of constant doom. The work has a strong visual appeal. And it is precisely in the richness of the use of symbols and emblematic images that Alan Parker's film finds the strength to tell a relatively simple story (without being empty). If it was just a horror movie, without all the references, it wouldn't become so memorable. Just as if it were simply a visual film, without a decent script, it wouldn't be worth mentioning either. Using a dark environment and an even darker city as a backdrop for an intelligent and surprising narrative, which mixes mystical elements with the traditional structure of suspense thrillers, and also has two of the greatest actors of his generation in great performances, the director Alan Parker offers the viewer a fantastic work, which deserves to be appreciated in the smallest detail.

De Niro the master of method acting, always in deep concentration and the young Mickey Rourke who, apart from ""Barfly"" plays the role of his life, went at it hammer and tongs. Secondly Alan Parker the British director of masterpieces like ""Birdy"", ""The Commitments"" and ""The Wall"" together with Michael Seresin the director of photography, created an unforgettable atmosphere of William Hjoertsbergs novel ""Falling Angel"". A dazzling mixture of a film noir of the 50´s and Goethe´s Faust.

His fingernails are sharpened like demonic claws. There is another religious theme that shows itself right away, the ""name it and claim it"" prosperity gospel. This draws us in to this mysterious horror film. As of 4/26/2019 Angel Heart was streaming on Amazon Prime Video. The rest of this review contains spoilers. Mickey Rourke's character is a private investigator. He's been retained by DeNiro's character, ""Mr. Cypher"" to find Johnny Favorite. He has to determine whether he is alive or dead. Sounds easy enough? I think it's clear at the get go Cypher is not of this world. I originally suspected he was the devil. It was pretty neat to see Kathleen Wilholte as the records clerk. I recalled seeing her as Luke's sister on Gilmore Girls. Rourke's character ""Harry Angel"" interrogates a poor of addicted doctor in his own home. You can see right away Rourke is used to dealing in unorthodox methods. After getting some info on Johnny Liebling (Favorite) , he locks the old man in his room. He is a quite brutal interrogator. Upon returning, he sees the old man has committed suicide. He was an addict but it seems somehow implausible that he would do it. Angel tries to get out of the job and Cypher lures him in with $5000. He was previously making $120 a day. Although he is spooked and possibly a murder suspect, Angel reaffirms himself to the case. He discovers Johnny Favorite is some kind of deceiver. He's had facial reconstructive surgery and paid off a doctor to claim he is still in the hospital when he is out and doing things. Just what he is doing we don't know at this point. Continuing the journey, Angel meets up with his informant girlfriend. She strips naked while talking to him and they make love. This is all despite his almost hallucinatory visions he starts having about wheels and fans and shady places. Rourke looks so cool in this film. It's a gumshoe film noir. He proceeds down to Coney Island and has a conversation with a woman who once knew Johnny Favorite. He finds out there was some witchcraft associated with the guy. A lady from the carnival was introducing him to it. His character just gets more and more mysterious from that point. Angel tracks down a fortune telling woman played by Charlotte Rampling and rings her doorbell. The New York buildings and antique interiors are beautiful. They serve to entrance you. There is a supernatural vibe throughout. All the familiar faces here are very young. After all, it is from 1987. She tells Angel Johnny is dead and seems offended. She kicks him out. He wants his palm read but she says, ""I don't think you'd like what I see."" He goes into a Cajun Voodoo shop and asks about a woman named Evangeline Proudfoot. He rents a car to venture out to see her. She is dead but her daughter is played by Lisa Bonet, most will remember her as one of the daughters on the Cosby Show. She looks great soaking wet, t-shirt and all. Soon she's in a scene writing to a drumbeat naked pouring chicken blood on her chest. Times have changed I guess, especially if you think about how Cosby is in jail for feeding ruffees to women and raping them. To make a long plot shorter, we end up finding out that Angel was being paid by the devil himself (DeNiro) to investigate and reveal his own misdeeds. The end of the film is a revelation to Angel that he is indeed Johnny and he's been living in someone else's memories. I don't really get the very end of the film.

Angel Heart is one of those films that matures with age and grows on audiences and film connoisseurs alike. A psychological horror/thriller is one of the hardest genres for a director to prosper in but if you were to mix in spiritual and religious elements along with a heap of film noir, a touch of romance and a smidgen of jazz then you would set yourself a near impossible task, nevertheless it would be a task in which Alan Parker would succeed. The direction of this film is masterful as Parker engages us through a meticulous atmosphere littered with mysterious allegories, gut rendering paranoia and an unmatched sense of place. This unmatched sense of place is a symptom of his stark imagery and sombre lighting which is played out through an amalgamation of film noir and the focal iconography of 50s and 60s French New Wave (the use of elevators, ceiling fans, staircases etc). For many of these reasons and more Angel Heart is a very influential film and its inspirations can be seen in many of the psychological thrillers/horrors released in the past 20 years, it is thought provoking and at times a lot more disturbing than any of its genre equivalents. The multi-faceted love scene in the film is one such example, it plays very well as it is cleverly interspersed with a host demonic echelons which (given its style and narrative position) I believe to be unparallelled, even in contemporary cinema. Overall Angel Heart is a very well paced and well acted film  although initially I felt that having Mickey Rourke in the lead role was a poor choice (based on his more recent work) but clearly he was at his acting best in his younger days almost Oscar-worthy, Robert De Niro is also on form as is the young Lisa Bonet  but these performances combined with everything else make Angel Heart a film that will stick with you, not as much as Midnight Express or Mississippi Burning (dir. Alan Parker), but enough to make you ponder why this film wasn't so successful upon its initial release and enough to curse why he didn't spend more time dabbling in the psychological/horror genre.",393,75,11,False
imdb_angel_heart_kingm21_20060104,Angel Heart,IMDb,KingM21,2006-01-04,7,A Fallen Angel.,"Harry Angel, a low-rent private detective, has been hired by Louis Cyphre to track down a man with whom he has some sort of contract. The investigation leads Harry from person to person, from New York to New Orleans, through many dark twists and turns. As he goes deeper into the case, he gets pulled into a world of Voodoo, the occult, and murder and finds that he himself is involved somehow. He struggles to find out the truth behind everything going on and when he does, it's quite the revelation for him. It took me several viewings to finally grip Angel Heart. The film is a bit difficult, not in that it's hard to understand the plot but that there are so many details to sort through. You must pay attention to make sense of all the names mentioned, the flashbacks, the twists, and a tricky back-story that is given to us piece by piece. That said, when all the things come together, it does work well for the most part. Alan Parker's direction is both subtle and sharp, and he really does a fine job capturing the noir-type mood. He's also able to bring the 50's era to life without going overboard or relishing in it, he just simply shows it. The slushy New York locations contrasted with rainy, humid New Orleans suit the story very well (the change in climate being a reflection upon Harry's own comprehension and, indeed, fate), as does the bluesy/jazzy soundtrack. And that pounding heartbeat really helped to turn the tension levels up. Mickey Rourke is excellent as Harry. He's got just the right amount of New York accent and brings true emotions to his character; formidable, frightened, or distraught, he performs realistically. Now Robert De Niro, it's just a pleasure watching him as a sly Satan! His mannerisms, from a slight grin to a menacing glance to eating an egg, are wonderful. I've read some negative remarks about Lisa Bonet's acting in the film but I thought she did just fine with her role, as did the rest of the cast. So, aside from the sometimes confusing plot points, I thought Angel Heart was a very good horror mystery and holds up well for being nearly 20 years old. I really do enjoy story-driven films dealing with such subject matter and was not disappointed with the one in Angel Heart.",398,31,4,True

Alan Parker's `Angel Heart' is one of the chosen few! Complex and confusing at times, but warmly recommended to fans of the occult and mysterious cinema. Mickey Rourke shines as protagonist Harry Angel. An unshaved, chain-smoking private eye with a chicken-phobia! The year is 1955 and the place is Brooklyn when Harry is hired by a malevolent Mr. Louis Cyphre (pronounce this name aloud a few times in a row) to find a missing crooner, who got severely traumatized in the war. The money is good and the job doesn't seem that risky, so Harry accepts. Pretty soon, the search takes him to all kinds of poverty, human misery, superstition and alternate religions. Every important figure in the search for Johnny Favorite (the crooner) finds a violent death after Harry talked to them and, apparently, our private detective is a lot more involved than he initially thought. As mentioned before, Angel Heart is a darn complex and very coherent film. One viewing is enough to understand the entire premise and main storylines, but a second (third or fourth) viewing sure isn't redundant. It would be a shame if any of the carefully worked out details and character-connections would go unnoticed. `Angel Heart' (and especially cinematographer Michael Seresin) also receives a huge plus for the dark and depressing portrayal of the film's surrounding. Angel Heart looks unattractive, vile and ominous which creates a superb horrific atmosphere. The supernatural aspects about the story are a bit overly stressed by clichés like silent and staring nuns or foggy New York suburbs. But this small negative element is largely made up by the subtle violence and compelling mystery this film features. The acting is outstanding with Rourke at the absolute top of his career. During the second half of the 80's, Mickey was the unforgettable star of several brilliant films such as `Barfly', `Year of the Dragon', `Nine ½ Weeks' and of course this `Angel Heart'. Robert DeNiro as Louis Cyphre was a downright brilliant casting idea! There isn't that much De Niro content in this film but, when he's on screen, evilness nearly drips from the screen. Bobby De Niro is probably one of the only actors who can make it look eerie to eat an egg! Lisa Bonet, in conclusion, isn't the world's most talented actress but Angel Heart sure is her best film.

Whenever Angel talks to his acquaintances, they end up dead in gruesome ways (One poor soul ends up in gumbo!). O.K. Kids, this is where the spoilers come into play, so if you haven't seen this film WALK AWAY NOW!!! There are 3 reasons why this film is incredibly creepy: 1) The ending: When Harry Angel finds out the disturbing truth that HE is Favourite and that Cyphre is Lucifer (Which people should have figured out in the beginning), you are in just as much disbelief as he is! How on earth did this happen? When Cyphre breaks it down, and the viewer can see the evidence, then it makes sense. Angel screams in denial, saying that he knows who he is, but then he (And us)starts to realize that he's wrong. He admits to himself (And to the viewers)that HE had committed the horrible murders in the film. 2)Lisa Bonnet: I was (and still am) a die-hard fan of ""The Cosby Show,"" and will always see her as Denise Huxtable. Her role as Epiphany was a total change, and to see her in an INCREDIBLY STEAMY love scene with Rourke totally shattered that image. Then for us to find out that she was Rourke's daughter? Another sin that will surely send him to hell (Incest, as well as murder). 3)The images and sounds:The constant use of blood,spiral staircases,and elevators are used in a nightmarish way. The viewer gets caught up in the nightmare, swirling out of control like Harry. The final image, of Harry in an elevator, going down, is the scariest of all. You KNOW who he is and what he's done, and he is going to burn. Simply put, he's on an express elevator to hell. One of Alan Parker's best, and he gets great performances from everyone, especially Rourke. And a guarantee good film to give you the shivers!",438,13,1,True

On the surface, that seems to be the moral of ""Angel Heart."" But look a little deeper -- the fact is, Harry Angel knew the truth all along, and here's the true moral: ""However cleverly you sneak up on a mirror... your reflection always looks you straight in the eye."" Much of the meaning in this dark tale lies in the above line uttered by DeNiro's character, Louis Cyphre. We can pretend to lie to ourselves and bury our heads in the sand, but in the end we know. And it isn't the knowing that hurts us, but all the hiding and lying that went on before. This film has been summed up many times before, so I won't do it again. It's also been said that the film was ahead of its time in 1987, and IMO this can't be emphasized enough. There's no doubt in my mind that it's been an influence on many a filmmaker and screenwriter. Among films of this type it's easier to follow than, say, ""Memento,"" but more befuddled and confusing than ""The Sixth Sense."" You may or may not guess the ending, but if you're the type who's bothered by confusing movies -- simply read all the spoilers or the whole screenplay, THEN see the film! I guarantee you won't enjoy it any less for knowing. Cinematography 10/10, screenplay 7/10, acting 9.5/10, overall I'd give it about a 9/10. If anything makes this movie great (and qualifies it as a classic) it's the cinematography and atmosphere. It really is richly and gorgeously shot, and atmospheric to the nth degree.

This is one of those films that seems to have garnered almost unanimous praise, so I feel a bit stupid in admitting that I found the narrative kinda hard to follow; a lot of the symbolism also seems to have gone right over my head, making the film a bit of a chore to fully comprehend. Angel Heart is, however, an undeniably stylish movie, with excellent visuals that make particularly good use of light and shadow (imbuing proceedings with that all-important pulp/film-noir atmosphere).

Angel Heart is a winding psychological thriller that -- in 1987 -- was far ahead of its time. So far that audiences didn't `get it' and the film bombed at the box office. Only now are we beginning to see endings like this one surface in horror movies. Had Angel Heart been made a decade or so later, perhaps it would have succeeded. As it is, the movie  which has a strong cult following and was recently re-released on a Special Edition DVD  is nothing short of mesmerizing. I wouldn't go so far as to call it great, or a `masterpiece,' but it is scary, disturbing, influential, thought-provoking, and a lot smarter and more atmospheric than 99% of the rip-off horror movies being made today. It stars Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a private eye from Brooklyn in the 1950s who is hired by Louis Cyphere (Robert De Niro) to locate a mysterious singer named Johnny Favorite, who disappeared in the early 40s and hasn't been seen since. Angel's journey takes him from the streets of New York to jazz clubs in Harlem and, finally, to the sweltering swamps of Louisiana. He meets a variety of characters, all of who have little to say about Favorite. All we seem to know is that he was a singer, entered the war, and was shot, had his face reconstructed, was taken out of hospital care, and apparently vanished from the face of the earth. I guessed the twist of the movie about seven minutes in, as soon as Robert De Niro appeared on screen during an extended cameo. But that's not to say that the movie won't affect you. Notorious when released for some controversial scenes (including a sequence involving Rourke and The Cosby Show's Lisa Bonet), the movie's moody atmosphere is its strongest element. The acting, too, is very strong. This is Rourke's finest performance, as Harry Angel, a scumbag detective with nothing to lose. On the new DVD, Rourke claims he wasn't very interested in acting at the time, and as a result `just showed up' and `memorized the lines.' I find that hard to believe  Rourke's acting here is Oscar-worthy. His recent descent into self-loathing has caused his career to fall apart (he was never enthusiastic about acting and wanted to become a boxer instead); he shouldn't discredit his earlier work merely because he's upset with his life. The role of Louis Cyphere (get it?) is also one of De Niro's most ambitious performances; he delves entirely into character and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. It was directed by (Sir) Alan Parker, the famous British filmmaker (of, among others, Midnight Express). Some say this is his finest film  wonderfully crafted, beautifully shot, masterfully edited  and I'd have to say that if it isn't his best, it certainly ranks somewhere at the top.",495,117,17,True

imdb_angel_heart_disinterested_spectator_20141128,Angel Heart,IMDb,disinterested_spectator,2014-11-28,10,A Faustian Tale That Makes Sense,"One of the problems with the story of Faust, the man in the German legend who sold his soul to the Devil, is that we never understood why anyone would make such a foolish bargain in the first place. A few decades of wealth, power, fame, and sex in exchange for an eternity of suffering the fires of Hell? Evil may be fascinating, but stupidity never is, and we quickly lose interest in the fate of anyone dumb enough to do that. The story fares much better when understood in the allegorical sense, of course, but it is always better if a story makes sense literally if it is to have much value figuratively. This movie solves that problem. Johnny Liebling is a crooner who thinks he knows a way to trick Satan. He makes a pact with him, in which Satan gets Johnny's soul in exchange for fame as a singer, under the name Johnny Favourite. Having made the deal and benefited from it, he then performs a ritual that involves cutting the heart out of a soldier and eating it. By so doing, Johnny is able to substitute the soldier's soul for his own, the result being that the soldier's soul will have to suffer the fires of Hell, while Johnny's soul does not. The soldier's name is Harold Angel, suggesting his innocence, of course. As part of the ritual, the soldier's dog tags are sealed up in vase. Only if Johnny himself opens the vase will the ritual be undone. Because Satan wants Johnny's soul and not Angel's, he must trick Johnny into breaking open the vase. When World War II breaks out, Johnny is drafted and subsequently suffers an injury, which causes him to have amnesia. He spends some time in a hospital, but his friends get him out. Not knowing what to do with him, they simply drop him off in a crowd of people on New Year's Eve. As a result of Johnny's confused memory about swapping souls with Harold Angel, he comes to believe that he is Harold Angel, and eventually starts working as a private detective under that name. Ten years after the war, which is when the movie starts, this Harold Angel is hired by Louis Cyphre (Lucifer) to find Johnny Favourite. Angel does not realize it, but he has been hired by the Devil to find himself. We do not realize it either, at this point, and we are encouraged by the movie to like Angel and to identify with him. He seems to be basically a nice guy. As he starts investigating, he begins experiencing disturbing images from the past. Little by little, he begins to suspect the truth. He is horrified at the idea that he might be Johnny Favourite, and having come to like him and identify with him, we are horrified too. In his desperation to assure himself that he is who he thinks he is, he breaks open the vase, and the dog tags of the real Harold Angel fall out. The spell is broken. At this point, Louis Cyphre appears, announcing that Johnny's soul now belongs to him. Finally, recent memories that Johnny had distorted are replaced by accurate ones, and he is forced into the realization that he has murdered several people. Because Johnny thought he had a way to trick the Devil, this story works on a literal plane. And by making us like him as Harold Angel and identify with him, the movie forces us to realize that we too may not be as good as we like to think we are, that we too have something inside us that is evil. But a remark made by Louis Cyphre gives this Faustian story a new twist. Cyphre says that Johnny was doomed the minute he cut that boy's heart out. In other words, all that dabbling in black magic and making a pact with the Devil was just so much hocus-pocus. In itself, it was harmless nonsense, and Johnny would never have gone to Hell for that. It was only when he did something truly evil, when he murdered that soldier, that Johnny was damned. By this remark, Cyphre links the literal understanding of this story with its allegorical one.",709,78,12,True

The whole thing thumps along menacingly into dark, seamy corners--and yet, aside from all the voodoo ambiance, there's not a whole lot going on (Parker is a pro at hiding this until the ending, which has a high ""Oh, brother!"" quotient).

It has the detective angle of ""Chinatown"", with people turning up dead, questionable connections and a private dick who may have to hide from the cops himself (well, that could be ""Maltese Falcon"", too, I suppose).

It has a tendency to leave you feeling quite disturbed and unsettled. This can be attributed mainly to the films last 15 minutes, wherein the lead character Harry Angel, a private investigator (played by Mickey Rourke), learns the emotionally devastating truth behind the case he has been working on. Rourke is quite good throughout the entire movie, lending his character a certain sleazy-cool charm, but it is in the films last few moments that he shines best. His harrowing display of pain in these scenes is so intense and believable that you truly feel his despair. Robert De Niro who appears in only a few scenes (in a key role), also does good work. Now for the down side. Director Alan Parker from the very beginning imbues his film with such a heavy atmosphere of impending doom that we hardly have a chance to breathe. If he had perhaps lightened up a bit in those earlier scenes, the ending would have slowly crept up on us and been even more shocking and disturbing than it was. Also he attempts to combine the horror and detective genres with only moderate success (especially in the later case). What usually thrills us about classic film-noir detectives is their sarcastic wit and hip dialogue. This verbal element is sorely lacking in ANGEL HEART, so the audience tends to latch onto the visual aspects of the investigation which are not enough to keep us totally riveted for the first two thirds of the film. On occasion the director also loses his sense of subtlety and allows sex, blood and gore to steal the show (as in the bedroom scene with Rourke and Lisa Bonet).

I immediately knew this was going to be my 1987 film of choice. The actual product was a bit of a let down I'm sorry to say. The biggest and most glaring problem this film has is simply that it's painfully boring. A mystery of sorts is set up and then we watch the character of 'Angel' going from person to person asking around trying to find a guy. We are given no reason to care about this mystery and very little along the way to mix things up and keep it interesting.

One thing I liked about the film is the simple story, or more accurately, the atmosphere. M. Night has always been better at creating a mood than fleshing out a story, but the premise of Lady in the Water works for me: It about people reacting to a fairy tale happening in real life. This concept probably put a lot of people off, the fact of the matter is this concept hasn't been used a lot (but it has been done before, i.e. Peter Weir's ""The Last Wave"", a deeper and more philosophical film), and people aren't used to it. Like I said, I liked it, but most of my friends thought it was stupid. The main thing that people hated was M. Night's own acting in the film, and on this I agree. He was without a doubt the worst thing in the film. It was a disgusting example of self-indulgence and self-importance, and more than that, he's just a terrible actor and he should stop. The one thing that I really had a hard time stomaching was the extended sequences with the party band, Silvertide. They were so awful I wanted to walk out of the movie. Picture a blonde version of The Black Crows with even less talent ripping through and f*(^king up a version of Dylan's ""Maggie's farm"". Those few things aside, the rest of the cast was great, I thought the story was simple and decent enough, the ""film critic"" part with Bob Balaban was funny, but M. Night was asking for it with that one, and the movie as a whole was entertaining. M. Night started out as the new golden boy of Hollywood with ""The Sixth Sense"", but many have felt he's lost his touch. The truth is he hasn't lost his touch, he just hasn't grown as a director. With ""The 6th Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"", ""The Village"", and now ""The Happening"", he keep tilling the same field. it's getting old. ""The 6th Sense"" was great, mostly because it was fresh, ""Unbreakable"" was entertaining for me at least due to the comic book references, but ""Signs"", ""The Happening"", and especially ""The Village"" were just plain terrible. ""Lady In The Water"" was a nice diversion from his formula, but it's getting tired. Perhaps M. Night would benefit from directing a script written by someone else, and not built around some moronic ""twist"" at the end, and most definitely not acting in it.",441,38,19,False
imdb_lady_in_the_water_strikefire83_20060723,Lady In The Water,IMDb,strikefire83,2006-07-23,1,"Pedantic, contrived exercise in tedium and boredom","As someone who loved The Sixth Sense and Signs, and who liked Unbreakable, I've got to say it's disappointing where Shyamalan seems to be taking his movies. Lady in the Water has none of those attributes. For one thing, it's boring, something none of his other movies were. Here we have a sloppily unstructured mess of a film filled to the brim with incoherent bedtime story ""mythology"" that changes from one minute to the next, so even if you try and follow the world of the story your efforts will only be met with frustration. The film's flaws are many, and as others have and will point them out with much more dexterity than me, I'll simply list the films greatest foibles. 1) Shyamalan casts HIMSELF as a John the Baptist character who will inspire ""a great leader who will change everything"" from a hastily constructed presumable political treatise entitled, of all things, The Cookbook. Give me a break! As someone who styles himself as a modern day Hitchcock, M. Night should take a page from that man's book and continue to play cameo roles, not central ones. 2) His supporting characters are a mish-mash of ethnic and cultural stereotypes. The ""Asian"" student who attends university but cannot string together a coherent English sentence. Of course the otherworldly ""mythology"" is the remnant of some vaguely Eastern legend based on truth. The old Jewish woman is tackily dressed and her husband is always in the bathroom. Please. 3) The film/movie critic is one of the ONLY interesting and rounded characters, and Shyamalan kills him off as he rattles off trite contrivances. This character's appearance seems like a defensive self-conscious way to preempt the critical panning of this film. When a writer forces one of his characters to go on the defensive in dialogue, you know something has got to be wrong with a movie. 4) Shyamalan continues his now hackneyed convention of having a protagonist who's suffered tremendous loss in the form of familial death. Enough Already. Paul G is a great actor, the unnecessary back story about a dead family and a lost medical practice trite and out of place. The list goes on and on, but suffice it to say this movie is a waste of celluloid, or hard drive space if you'd prefer. Avoid like plague.",388,224,178,True

Night Shyamalan has established the ending as the high point of his films, I was particularly watching the final moments here. Disappointingly, Shyamalan delivers a few very weak, very easy to spot ""twists"" tied up in a Hollywood Happy Ending. I've nothing against happy endings but, with Shyamalan, I expect the ending, whatever type it may be, to have quite a punch. The rest of the movie has the quality we've come to expect from Shyamalan. Tight direction, angles and shots that not only look good but also become part of the storytelling, and a layered script all add up to a fun and very interesting ride. Unfortunately the ride runs out of gas rather than coming to a final destination. Shyamalan takes a good stab at the fantasy genre here and doesn't waste any time establishing belief amongst the characters. They all quickly accept and then begin to act upon the proposition that Story is a real life fairy-tale creature, come to benefit them and mankind as a whole. Their belief seems too abrupt but it's clear that Shyamalan wanted to dive right into the story. I would have liked just a little more cynicism from the humans though. If he had set the story in the past their immediate acceptance may have been more plausible. But in current day Philadelphia? I just don't see that many folks accepting a fantasy being at face value. The writing is a good bit more humorous than his past scripts. There are a good many chuckles and even a few laugh out loud moments. Giamatti is in a role tailor made for him and he carries it with no problems. Howard shows a suitable sense of wonder and innocence as Story. The rest of the cast, a fairly large group of characters, are solid as well. Shyamalan writes himself into his largest role to date and does quite well. Overall I can't say it's a bad movie. The Shyamalan quality alone puts this above most of the competition. However, he has set himself a pretty high standard with his earlier films and this one falls short.",366,19,8,True

Year after year, his works of uncompromised genius are poorly received by theatergoers and film critics alike. Even Disney didn't want to make his latest film, Lady in the Water, fearing that it was poorly written, featured too large a role for the writer/director, and contained an embarrassingly self-indulgent attack at his detractors, the crrritics. And as much as I hate to agree with Disney, they were absolutely right. The story, as convoluted as you've come to expect from the man, is not the main problem here. Sure, it's chock-full of narfs, tarturic, and poorly drawn stereotypes, but the larger issue for me was the cringe-inducing self-indulgence that runs rampant throughout the film. For instance, Shyamalan plays the role of an author, misunderstood in his time, who will one day influence a boy destined to become the president of the United States. Self-fulfilling prophecies, anyone? His acting is embarrassing and unintentionally hilarious in turns, and his reactions to pivotal plot points had me longing for the brief, campy cameos of years past. While I can understand M. Night's desire to respond to the unenlightened critics that failed to see the staggering brilliance of his previous works, one has to question the response itself. Shyamalan is multitasking here, attempting to transport his audience through the magical realism of his self-proclaimed ""bedtime story"" while simultaneously denouncing his critics for trashing the gospel of M. Night. In the end, we're left with a fairy tale too aware of itself to fully envelop us and a pseudo-manifesto too delusional and self-important to inspire us in any way. In the end, Shyamalan made a film that can really only be enjoyed by himself. It's just a shame that the likes of Paul Giamatti, Bob Balaban, and Freddy Rodriguez have to go down with the Good Ship Shyamalan.",308,146,117,True

I don't understand why it has engendered such hostility. I mean, I can see problems in the movie that people could object to, but people are calling this the worst movie in years and the like, and I find that completely out of proportion. So here's what I think: Direction Shyamalan has made movies before featuring ostensible everyman types, but this time he has moved away from Hollywood-everyman to a genuine everyman by casting Paul Giamatti as a sad sack building super. Giamatti is likable and quite funny, and the movie starts off with a breezy humor that instantly made me like it. There are problems when the plot kicks in with the appearance of a young woman named Story. It turns out she might be a creature called a narf from a Chinese fairytale, so the first problem is, narf isn't remotely Chinese-sounding. Still, I liked the way the movie builds, as Giamatti tries to help her and discovers neighborliness and credulity aren't dead. I enjoy the movie's optimism about people even if I don't share in it, and I like the way he spreads his typical revelations throughout instead of sticking them all at the end. While people have claimed the story is slow, I thought it was well paced. And while I can admit to many of the criticized plot holes, I just don't care; it had the feel of a little fairy tale of the modern age, which I found quite charming. And the movie is frequently amusing, which counts for a lot with me. My main criticism is that Lady in the Water would be a much better film with two minutes taken out. Shyamalan decided to savage movie critics, apparently stung by the deserved panning of The Village (which inexplicably received more positive criticism than this film). That's fine in itself, but in one scene Shyamalan simply steps outside of the movie to make fun of the critic. In itself it's a rather amusing scene, but you don't carefully create an atmosphere and encourage a suspension of disbelief and then just shock the audience into the real world in a petty act of vengeance. Shyamalan ignores one of the fundamental rules of film making; if any scene, even if it's the best scene in the film, takes away from the whole, you cut it. I'm very disappointed in Shamalyan for allowing his bitterness to trump his common sense. It's a small thing, and I won't say it ruined the movie, but it was jarring. And perhaps that's part of why the reviews are so bad, because that scene made people drifting along on the movie's logic snap awake and start thinking about everything that was wrong. Although that's just a theory. Anyway, cut out that two minutes and it would be a considerable improvement. As for people complaining the movie isn't that scary, well, I don't think it was trying to be that scary. I do think the director's intent is more important than what he's done in other movies. Just because he usually tries to scare us doesn't mean he is this time; I think he was just going for some mild suspense. Anyway, while others are saying Shyamalan has lost it, but for me he's been consistent; one good movie, one bad one. Sixth Sense (great), Unbreakable (tedious, but interesting ending), Signs (good movie, tremendous ending), The Village (wretched) and Lady in the Water (funny and charming). So I don't have high hopes for the next one, but this one was quite enjoyable.",598,53,7,False

It seemed that Shyamalan was writing the ending twists to his movies first, then writing the story around it. I didn't really want to see Lady in the Water, but had free tickets to the local premiere. This movie, however, breaks from Shyamalan's regular scripts and has sense of originality about it. I was impressed by how outright funny this movie was at many times. I was very impressed by the writing because it showed a different side to M. Night Shyamalan's talent. Shyamalan plays a larger role in this movie and does a decent job. The star of this film, and the outright reason that it was enjoyable, was Paul Giamatti. I have seen him in many films, but never in the leading role. He was funny, emotional and strong throughout the entire film. This film is a testament to his greatness as an actor. I would hope that this will result in another Academy Award nomination for him. Perhaps it was because of Giamatti's lead, but many other lesser known actors were also impressive as a result. Bryce Dallas Howard did a good job in her role, but it was probably better that Giamatti was given more camera time and lines. True, the monsters look fake... but what does a ""real"" monster really look like? This movie, however, is NOT horror. Much like The Village, the trailers are misleading. Shyamalan should hire someone new to do his promotions. Anyone expecting a scary movie will be very disappointed. Unlike The Village, this movie was never boring. Believe it or not, it's safe to take the kids to this one. There is no gore or graphic violence. Is this a fantastic movie? No, but you will be entertained and surprised by some of the great acting jobs. I would call this Shyamalan's best work since The Sixth Sense.",323,36,29,True

The SIxth Sense marked the debut of M. Night's fame and popularity. The atmosphere and vibe that he created, along with a clever plot and a twist ending made movie-goers everywhere realize the importance of Shyamalan. He, to some extent, created a cult following. Now, four movies later, many of his fans are wondering when he will reveal a movie as amazing as The Sixth Sense. With the OK-at-best movie Unbreakable, people were wondering if he was just a one-hit-wonder director. Then, with Signs, there was some hope that he would make a comeback. But, then he released The Village. After he lost thousands of fans due to that horrendous movie, he attempts at making another good movie. He most certainly fails. The movie places a stuttering man who lost his entire family in an Apartment complex. He, as the super, notices someone swimming late at night. This is the Lady from the title. You see, M. Night created an entire ""Bed Time Story"" about how land people used to coexist with the people of the ""Blue World"" (the ocean). These people speak English. But Land people got greedy and started fighting. But the Blue World people stayed pure, like water, as the Super points out. To help out the greedy people, huge birds that no land person has ever seen flies them to the land, and they must confront a ""Chosen One"" (no really, that is how the put it) and show them the way. The way the chosen one is directed will end up helping the land people as a whole. The Chosen One is, of course, M. Night himself. He can write, direct, produce and now act. He must be the chosen one. Anyways, there are wolves that aren't wolves, but are Scants or something. Their fur is grass and they are green. So that is why no person has seen them. These Scants attack people from the Blue World, but not the land. But there are rules. The night that the Snarf (lady of the blue world, The main Lady) returns to the blue world, the cannot attack them. If they do, these monkeys that aren't monkeys will kill them. There are three. And they are also made out of grass. But normal Scants wont attack Snarfs unless they are Rogue Scants. And those usually wont do it either, unless the Snarf is a Madame Snarf. And she is. So now the protagonist, Cleveland must find people to help him. You see, there are some normal people that help the Snarfs. Among the people are the Healer, the Guardian, the Guild and the Interpreter. These people are the only people who can see the Snarf leave. No one else can... or else it wont work or something. And the moral is that no one knows who they are. I'm serious. Anyways, the main bulk of the movie is Cleveland looking for people who can help, and being wrong a lot. And then he keeps stuttering. And it is annoying. This is definitely M. Night's worst directed movie. Many of the shots are out of focus and hurt your eyes. And then there were the random shots, like when it showed the sign of The Cove while people were dying. And there were a lot of unnecessary close ups. The writing is by far the worst in any movie. The Interpreter figures out what to do by looking at cereal boxes. I am not kidding. It hurt me inside when it happened. The acting was decent by many, but some of the people should not be actors. M. Night was pretty good, but his lines were kept at a minimum. Despite the absurdity of the Bed Time Story, every single person Cleveland told it to believed it immediately. And that is about 15 people. Just imagine someone telling you that a human that looks like everyone else... that doesn't even have gills, lives in the water. Nope, not happening. The only good thing I could find was the music... and only the last song. A few of the other songs were out of place and unnecessary. But the song during the climax was very well composed. M. Night should, in my opinion, stop directing and maybe pick up a different hobby. Like not directing. Or writing. Overview: This movie is in my top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. I laughed at how absurd the story was, but never laughed at the so-called 'funny parts.' Do not see this movie unless you like pain. Final grade: 3/1000",775,131,114,True

I, who usually disagrees with most audiences, at least, thoroughly enjoyed this film. The storyline itself is rather ridiculous, I must say. Some girl shows up in a pool? She's a what-a narf? I went into the movie thinking I would hate it, but I came out knowing that I had seen a work of art. That's right. It was art. First of all, it's a good family film, with enough tense moments to keep you watching, and enough laugh-out-loud moments to calm you down. It was refreshing for once to see a film with good, clean humour. The dialogue was not necessarily hilarious, but the actors, especially Paul Giamatti (Cleveland) delivered the lines extremely well. The acting was tremendously well done also. Paul Giamatti is always fantastic, and while Bryce Dallas Howard seemed to act in the same manner as she did in The Village, she was still convincing. The ensemble cast worked well together. Some might bash M. Night for casting himself in a not-so-cameo role, but he proved that he can actually act! No, his performance will not win him an Oscar, nor should it, but I think there is definite talent there. I hope to see him in bigger roles, in films not his own. The plot had many twists, maybe too many, but no matter. I kept trying to guess what was going to happen, but it I was always wrong. It was quite interesting. What most made this film a work of art was the directing. M. Night has a rare talent that will go completely under the radar for this film because no one will see it. The camera angles were inventive-that's right, inventive. I may be one of the few who actually cares about camera angles and how a scene looks, but it looked great. The final product was polished. I truly believe this film is M. Night's best work. He made the story up himself, wrote a screenplay that made us laugh, smile, cringe, and jump just a little, and directed a great ensemble cast including himself. Quite a feat. So before everyone starts ranting about how stupid the storyline is or how ""so-not-scary"" the film is, just appreciate the uniqueness of the film, and remember what makes this film good.

However, it seems to have been marketed as a scary, horror thriller, which does it an injustice. I almost missed it because of the hype, and my teenage daughter skipped watching the DVD with me, because she does not like ""scary movies."" She was clearly misled. It's hard to categorize Lady in the Water. Suffice it to say that the author himself calls it a bedtime story. I predict that you will enjoy this film if you have enjoyed: - The Princess Bride - Paul Giamatti's characters - Rod Serling's Twilight Zone - Stephen King's ""It"" Like the Princess Bride, Lady in the Water is a romantic fable about love, but not about romantic love. The love in this film is love of neighbor, a good Samaritan kind of love. Paul Giamatti is the core and fiber of this film. No other character is developed as much as his character. He plays a Jimmy Stewart for our generation, a bumbling everyman with a core of integrity and humble good will. To me this movie resembles the best of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone. It's an eerie morality play, where the audience gladly suspends their disbelief in order to enter the author's realm. It also strongly reminds me of Stephen King's ""It"" (read the book, rather than watch the mini-series)in that it follows a band of outcasts whose characters grow enormously as they discover their own latent talents in a foreign world that exists just beyond the perceived reality. And for the record, I thought M. Night Shyamalan's acting turn in his own movie was rather good. Lady in the Water is not a perfect film, not even a masterpiece, but it does not deserve the scorn that has been heaped upon it.

OK, the twist in The Village was obvious after minutes, but it was a film that did not deserve some of the lashings it received. But 'Lady In The Water' is a different story. It is a film that fails in everything it's trying to be. Primarily it's trying to be a family, fantasy adventure movie and I cannot imagine what kind of child (the primary audience for this genre) is not going to be bored out of their mind from the off. The reason it fails is Night and Night alone. Again he has made a slow burning dialogue heavy movie set completely in ""reality"". Where this film should be bright, lively, fun, exciting, magical it is instead dull (this is the worst work Chris Doyle's done), lifeless, turgid, bland and, dare I say, boring. The world of the movie is inappropriate for the genre it's living in. The reason that this style doesn't work is that the whole point of the movie is that's it's a fantastical bedtime story, yet it's devoid of anything fantastical. This film should be set in a world like ours, but not ours. Night - not everything in your imagination can happen in Philadelphia! This movie also feels like it's only ever gone thru two drafts. First draft was a straight up bedtime story which Night has read back and realised ""man, this doesn't work... at all. It's terrible"" so he's written in a whole layer of character (allegedly... horrifically inaccurate caricature's more accurate) and dialogue who are there solely to justify how bad some things are. sadly he doesn't seem to have read draft 2 to realise that the layers justifying how rubbish everything is are even worsely executed meaning the script is two layers of $h1t on top of each other. And then you have the complete audacity of the man in casting himself as the man who will (essentially) write the second bible. This would be ego gone insane if he was actually any good, but his performance is the one in the movie that really isn't anywhere near what it needs to be. There's a moment when the character finds out what his fate will be, a scene which an actor of quality would have been able to wrench your heart with, but a moment where Night actually looks like he's realised the film he's made could destroy his career (although I hope not)! Man, I could go on and on from the backstory being explained to you chunk at a time for no reason other than to flesh out the idea beyond what it ever deserved in such a way that it feels like Night's rewriting the rules of his own film as he goes because he's never had any solid idea of what the rules are at the start to the film critic who's only film criticism is ""it sucked"" which instantly destroys the attempt to set him up as an arrogant highbrow critic (he also gets possibly the worst cinematic death ever) to how blatantly obvious the red herrings are.

""Lady in the Water"" (2006) is a drama/fantasy based on a bedtime story that writer/director M. Night Shyamalan told his kids. Like most Shyamalan pictures there's a moving reverent ambiance amidst the amusing and sometimes horrific dramatics. It's very original, coming across as a Shyamalan flick mixed with elements of fantasy movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939). Think about it, ""The Wizard of Oz"" meshed a family drama with a dreamlike fantasy involving wonder, humor and slight horror along with a profound message, and so does this film (which isn't to say it's as effective as ""Wizard""). The set of the apartment complex and the cinematography thereof combined with James Newton Howard's score are all superb. Plus there are some amusing moments, like with the dour film critic (Bob Balaban). Similar to ""Signs"" (2002), there's a good theme about coming to grips with tragedy and moving on with a newfound sense of purpose. Moreover, Bryce is very appealing as the naïve fantasy creature and the movie leaves you with a warm feeling. On the negative side, the somewhat convoluted fable will be less than compelling for certain viewers and some critics understandably complained that it was a mistake for Shyamalan to cast himself as the writer whose words are the seeds to changing the world, although it didn't bother me; I think he's perfect for the role. Still, M. Night casting himself as the savior of the freakin' planet is a tad pretentious.

I realize this is ""meant"" to be a fable, but it's mostly the director --- who mugs his way through a key role in his own film, getting his own good side most of the time --- who's really out to lecture us. In passing, we get a middle class housing project in ""Philadelphia"" which seems to be situated with suburbs on one side and a national wildlife preserve on the other. We meet a mythical beast which looks like a crocadoggy, which appears at a building wide party but no one notices. Paul Giammati, who wears glasses in the film, manages what seems to be a hyper-athletic underwater dive without glasses or goggles that would have taxed an experience scuba diver. A film critic gets torn apart by the monster in a building corridor but no one notices (is M-Night suggesting something here?) and there is a really nasty racial sterotype of an Asian girl, a ""college student,"" who speaks we-all-sound-same funny-rice-girl English.

And in the spirit of all movies Shyamalan, I'll keep mum about the plot. I loved the pace, the control, and the development of how the plot unfolded. It had a whodunnit feel of a mystery that is carefully revealed layer by layer. The ensemble cast and characters were fantastic, with each character possessing usefulness to the story and to peer characters, and their eccentricities make them a joy to watch. You have the Korean mother and daughter, the Vietnam Vet, a father and son, a new neighbour, a group of cock-talkers, a guy who works out only his right side, and so on. Although most of them are one- dimensional, they are no less than endearing in their own way, like those in Cocoon or Batteries Not Included. I love the superb acting by the main leads of Paul Giamatti, who's fast becoming one of my favourite character actors, and in here, provided his character Cleveland Heep with much emotional baggage, pain and that almost natural stammer when nervous, and Bryce Dallas Howard, her Lady in the Water, name Story, is so beautiful, yet so enchantingly vulnerable. Both anchor this movie well and brought about believable character development, or in the case of Story, that oracle air of wisdom, wit and fear of the unknown. I love the special effects, done no less by Industrial Light and Magic. They're a pretty sight, even though some scenes were dark, literally and figuratively. Cinematography was done by Christopher Doyle, so those in Asia should already well be aware what he's capable of. There's a major departure from his previous films, which I think is probably good to keep things refreshing for the moment. Some points and scenes in the movie are so deceptively simple that you will almost guess the outcome before the next scene transition. The movie ended the way it should, instead of relying on the ""next big gimmick"". And probably bad news of those who loathe directors cameo-ing in the own movies, well, this time round, Shyamalan has quite a significant role for himself. And I know why many critics out there didn't give this movie the rating it deserves. They are surprised at Shyamalan's audacity in taking a huge swipe at critics in general, since they have been highly critical of almost all his past works. It's an obvious no-holds-barred jibe at their anal characters of being high and mighty and of imposing their thoughts and opinions on others, when little do they know that their opinions mean squat most of the time. There's another cheeky reference too at romances in the rain, which I thought perhaps cinematographer Doyle would have found it amusing given his work on Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love and 2046 (citing these 2 as I've recently watched the former). But those aside, thank you M Night, for sharing with us a wonderful bedtime story, which I think will be repeated at bedtime to many children around the world.

To me, the rest of my party, and apparently the entire audience, there was no point to this movie. I thought the general idea was good, but there was absolutely no plot to it. The movie is a fantasy, but at least the human elements of the movie could have been realistic. First off, every character in this movie seems to believe everything they are told. IF some guy came up to me and started rambling on and on about a ""narf"" I would laugh in his face. Yet, he doesn't even have to work to get people to help him out with whatever he is trying to do with this woman. Then watching a group of 35-50 year olds party like they were at a fraternity keg party was priceless. Weird beasts are running around outside that are covered in grass (another thing that had me laughing) and yet nobody seems to notice. Eventually the narf is saved and the grass covered wolf thing is beaten up by grass covered monkeys and an eagle comes to get the woman. Then it just ends. You don't see where the woman goes, you don't see what happens to anyone else for that matter. I wish I could let myself believe a bed time story from somebody in order to try to save some strange woman whom we never find out why she needs to be saved. At least I stuck it out and watched it until it ended, which I can not say for half of the audience.

imdb_lady_in_the_water_brianwolters_20060723,Lady In The Water,IMDb,brianwolters,2006-07-23,2,Shyamalan's Folly,"I would first like to say that I am a huge M. Night Shyamalan fan. I didn't see Sixth Sense until it was on DVD and once I did, I was hooked. I've enjoyed each film he has directed since then, including the much maligned ""The Village."" I've been eagerly awaiting Lady in the Water ever since I heard about it. The teaser last winter made me even more curious and I couldn't wait for this movie with a sense of wonder. After finally viewing the movie, I have to say that M.Night has a major mess on his hands. The movie is about an apartment maintenance man named Cleveland Heep whom seems to have a very dull life. He is good at what he does but you can't help but feel that he wants more. One night, when looking for people swimming after hours, he discovers a girl in the pool. Startled and clumsy, he falls into the pool and nearly drowns until he discovers himself back in bed with the girl in his house. She is a Narf from the Blue World who wants to return to her world and avoid the Scrunts (wolf like monster) as she tries to get back via the great eagle. She is to assist Cleveland in assembling a Guild to help her return. Little does Cleveland know that she is also there to help him overcome his grief of losing his family and quitting his job as a doctor. I have a good imagination and I was ready to see how all of this plays out. The child inside me was waiting for a payoff. I am sad to say, I never get it. The movie is a complete, convoluted mess and a huge failure of execution. Let me begin with the characters. The supporting characters in the movie were annoying stereotypes of all kinds of ethnic backgrounds. The young Asian woman, who conveniently told the story of the Narf's by interpreting for her mother was incredibly annoying. It would seem like if the story needed more explanation, she conveniently shows up to tell us more, even being available while at a dance club. Then we have the guy who is only working out one side of his body. He serves no real purpose until the end and when he does, it is completely laughable and not worth the moment of ""awe"" as the movie makes it. Then we have the movie critic, who seems to be there to serve as M.Nights poke at critics at his past movies. M.Night is also playing a supporting role but because he is the director who makes clever appearances, I kept waiting for something magical to happen with his character and we don't get it. He needs to stick with Hitchcock like appearances. The story itself unfolds slowly but when it should be getting more involving and interesting, it simply gets messier. You meet all of the characters in the film and you notice they have certain traits to their personality. Those traits are to be put to use in the Guild that Cleveland is trying to assemble. When it comes time to put it all together, you are waiting for something meaningful to happen and it just doesn't come together. Take the pool party scene. Has there been any scene in the past several years in movies as confusing and perplexing as this? They were there to protect the Lady yet stupid things happen. A girl drops her mirror who is to be watching for the Scrunt. The movie critic shows up and is given horrible dialogue. A band is to be playing inside but doesn't start on time. As a result of the confusion, the Lady is taken by the Scrunt and nearly killed. Then they realize the Guild is not correct and between a kid reading things in cereal boxes and his Dad finding clues in crosswords to shifting people and roles in Guild, I was simply confused because of the poor execution. We finally get one good scene when Cleveland has his catharsis and it was able to induce tears in audience members. But it simply comes back to the standard M.Night protagonist whom is trying to deal with personal tragedies. We saw this in Signs, The Village and again in this film. While that is a good thing to build a movie around, third time around is one too many. Finally, when things do play out as they should, we are scratching our heads and thinking ""Are we too stupid to understand this film, or is the film too stupid to understand."" I've noticed many fan reviews of this film and many liked it but I do tend to think they are way to kind to allow M.Night to have a folly. Lady in the Water is his first folly and I hope he will recover and wow us with his next film.",823,54,45,True

This was a disappointing performance, compared to The Village where she was great. She plays this nymph who is going to do something for the planet. Giamatti guards her. All she does is look sad and cower and sometimes smile, and speaks in a soft voice. No much of a role for her, or a performance. This Korean woman and her mother play key roles because the mother seems to know something about a story about a nymph. Giamatti pulls it all together and thinks he knows how to save the day, but does he? There's also a supernatural bad guy who is trying to stop everything. But the tension, well, it's not much IMHO. At the end, a bit of a twist, but not like The Sixth Sense type. Shyalaman loves to get the twists in though. I liked this movie, but it's just OK, so 6/10 covers it.

Night Predecessors,"When ""Lady In The Water"" first hit DVD/BluRay in December of 2006, I eagerly snatched it up in anticipation of M. Night Shyamalan's next masterpiece following ""The Village"". After viewing it at that time, I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen in my life. Six years later, after watching the film again with a younger sibling, I finally was able to understand the overall concept and thoroughly enjoy the experience. For a basic plot summary, ""Lady In The Water"" takes place in ""The Cove"", an apartment complex (complete with swimming pool) owned by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). When a mermaid-like being named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) suddenly turns up in Heep's pool, an entirely new world (with completely new beings) is discovered, one that Story must get back to at all costs. If you try to compare ""Lady in the Water"" to M. Night's earlier fare, you will be severely disappointed. This is not a ""surprise ending"" film, nor is it a psychological thriller. Comparing it to movies like ""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", & ""The Village"" is like comparing apples to oranges. When I originally watched the film, I was expecting the past and missed what this movie really is all about. The real genius of this movie? It is essentially a modern-day fairy tale. Based on a bedtime story M. Night told his children that later took on epic proportions, Shyamalan adapted the story into a major motion picture. As such, the story is incredibly original and quite fantastical, filled with imaginative characters and quirky real-life individuals. This project is a labor of love for M. Night, and I respect him for making it and making it well. The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars is because some of the plot points do not exactly line up. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but it is quite a bit fractured at that. It contains nothing ""worthy"" of the multiple Razzy Awards it ended up winning, but a few points in the film are a bit confusing/nonsensical. Overall, upon second viewing (with a completely different frame of mind), ""Lady In The Water"" is inches shy of a truly classic film. Once you understand WHY M. Night made the movie, you'll respect it in a completely different light.",389,16,2,True

It doesn't interest me how this film compares with the other Shyamalan films. Seems to me that most comparisons are quite a stretch, and unfair. ""Lady In The Water"" is a fairy tale. A fairy tale based on an original fairy tale world. That is just one reason why I give Shyamalan credit. I don't know of many who have created an original mythology. Lucas didn't, nor did Spielberg; even Roddenberry wasn't completely original, his ideas were, even if the space travel wasn't. Shyamalan did create a new mythology and dropped it in the middle of our 21st century lives. That strikes me as very new and creative. Like most here, I heard versions of Little Red Riding Hood and all the others, when I was a child. As I recall these these now, the secondary characters have specific roles they perform to aid the hero/heroine toward the happy ending. They where not intended to be complete characters, just helping along the way. They may have benefited, or may have just done their bit and moved on. This is seen in Lady in the Water, no one character in the film could have completed the end of the story alone, a team effort was required. There isn't a need to go into all the fairy tale-esquire detail, you know what I'm getting at, right? None of this is a bad thing. This film has great performances all around, humor, suspense and sadness, add to that Shyamalan's patient and slightly voyeuristic style that draws the viewer in, and you have a wonderful story.",287,3,2,False

Seriously? None of the dialogue sounded natural at all. The plot is full of holes. And the characters make decisions that make about as much sense as the mythology. The direction was nonexistent.

Night film knowing, good or bad, I am going to see a picture that is imaginative, original, and full of hope. This is one of very few writer/directors who actually strive to bring something new to the cinema on each different outing. So, how was the film? Good. Dare I say, great? If you like his films, this one will definitely hit you deep. You'll put it at the top of your ""M. Night List"", and be glad to have it in your DVD collection later this year. First, the acting. We all know Night has a habit of picking actors from the same pool. People he knows, trusts, and has worked with before. Willis has helmed two of his films, while Joaquin another two. This will be Bryce Dallas Howards second as well. We are used to Night writing his lead characters as more of a shadow of a man that once was. A tragic figure; this is no different in ""Lady In The Water"". Giamatti plays Heep very, very well. But, because of Giamatti's inclusion into Nights' world, we see things much lighter. Willis, Gibson, and Phoenix had a habit of turning everything dark and dreary. And while Giamatti is still a tragic figure, he is eager to believe and more than willing to take the word of a half naked girl in his home. I, personally, believe that he is the greatest actor Night has worked with. And the result? A much lighter film. Thank God. This is a fantasy. Not a horror, not a film with a twist (spoiler: there is none), which is good, because a twist would have put Night into an early grave. As a fantasy, a bed time story, Night treats us like children. Characters speak their inner dialogues, creatures with interesting names plague us at every turn, and the residents of this apartment complex are as interesting and comic as they are important. There is still the important Night message: Purpose. We all have one. We all are meant to be somebody. Now, all we have to do is figure that out. Even the intro reads like a children's' book; illustrations dance about in order to create a younger element to this tale. The plot is simple. Nymphs, beasts, guilds, healers, etc. Almost like a role-playing video game in a sense. The music and cinematography? Night kept his all-star team, and the project was helmed and sculpted beautifully. The faults? I dare say Night could have done with less characters. They all seemed important, but it crowded the screen, and left us with a question: Is this that persons' only purpose? That's sad. But, have fun with this film. It's a treat, as rare as Nights' films are. Night brings a world of reality into a world of dreams, and the saddest point of the film, was when we had to wake up.",497,335,166,True

I had difficulty at first deciding whether it was a genuinely brilliant exercise in film making, or a contrived piece of self indulgence from Shyamalan himself. I'm ready to side with the latter and call it a wrap. Here's why. In and of itself, the fairy tale bedtime story concept might work on the fly in real life, but here it looks like the movie itself was made up in the same fashion. What would have happened, one might ask, if the box of frosted flakes was on the other side of the oat bran? Would that have led to a different interpretation? It struck me watching the film how brazen M. Night stuck it in the face of film critics everywhere with his character Farber, brilliantly portrayed by the way by Bob Balaban. As for creating the mythology about his own self importance as a writer, I was reminded of that 'real men of genius' beer commercial - 'Nothing says I'm important more than a man shouting I'm important into his cell phone'. Redeeming qualities - there are a few. Paul Giamatti's performance was once again a pure gem of a portrayal. And lest you believe a one sided bodybuilder is too improbable to be true, there is in fact a real life counterpart to the character of Reggie in the world of sports. Anyone who's seen 'The King and His Court"" four man softball team can tell you pitcher Eddie Feigner's right arm is twice the size of his left. So at least that bit of whimsy was credible. In the end, 'Lady' didn't do it for me, and quite honestly, the only M. Night films that did were ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". The 1960's 'Twilight Zone' TV series had an episode with a cookbook also, but that was made by an alien race with recipes for humans. Now that was an original concept. If Mr. Shyamalan goes back to making thrillers that thrill and suspense films that excite, he won't have to tell us how brilliant it is, I think we'll recognize it.",367,3,2,True

Lady in the Water offers a good premise that is ruined by an underwhelming execution. The ideas and characters are interesting but the film just ended up being too silly with a ridiculous conclusion. I'm not sure who to blame for this misfire. M. Night Shyamalan has a good imagination and he did come up with an interesting story. However, as the film progressed, it was hard to stomach some of the characters and scenes. It was also hard to accept that everyone believed that Story was telling the truth. Why would they believe some random girl? The movie believes all this fairytale stuff is true and it wants the viewer to do the same which I couldn't do. The serious tone of the film was really annoying at times and most of the ""serious"" scenes encouraged unintentional laughter more than anything else. Behind the camera, he did a little better. He moved the film at a decent pace and it never slowed down. He also managed to create some tense moments although they were few and far in between. I didn't like how Shyamalan made his character the key to everything in the film. It just came off as a little egotistical. The one thing that the movie was trying to tell the audience was that man isn't child-like anymore and the world is on the brink of disaster. However, ""The Cookbook"" will change everything in the future and it will save mankind. Also, everyone in life has a purpose and we are all connected. It's a cute idea for a third grader but for most people it's just ridiculous. The characters carry out this idea without really stopping to question the absurdity of it all. The entire second half is a disaster including the ending which has to be one of the worst of the year. For the most part, the acting wasn't very good. Most of it was unnatural and the silly dialog killed a lot of the actors. Paul Giamatti was okay although he should leave this one off his resume. Bryce Dallas Howard was really creepy so she suited her character and she gave a decent performance. Cindy Cheung was just playing a stereotype. Freddy Rodriguez was just annoying.

But the one comparison you can make is that Shyamalan's movies tend to have similar themes and motifs: nothing happens by accident and loss. Each of Shyamalan's movies feature a character or characters who have lost a family member and have a specific purpose to the story. Lady in the Water is most similar to Signs, as the story features a character, Cleveland Heap (Paul Giamatti), who lost his family but finds as the movie goes along that he has a purpose to the world he is living in. Giamatti's performance is fantastic, though the character has a speech impediment that I found to be a contrivance and unnecessary. As the superintendent of The Cove apartment complex, Cleveland knows all of the tenants and the ins-and-outs of the complex. One night, Cleveland is checking out a night swimmer, when he falls into the pool. He is saved by a mysterious lady in the water, named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), who we later find out is a mythical creature from an Asian bedtime story. This is where the movie either works for you or doesn't work for you. You can either buy the premise that this apartment complex is the site of a battle between the forces of good and bad, or you will not buy it. This will determine whether you enjoy the movie or not. I bought into the conceit, and thought the movie was entertaining, not nearly as good as The Sixth Sense or Signs, or even Unbreakable, but still better than The Village. The movie does delve into some self-referential material, especially in the movie critic character played by Bob Balaban, and it is cute, though I could imagine some rolling their eyes at the last scene we see Balaban in the movie. Will you enjoy this movie? I don't know, it really is up to the individual movie goer. Will you buy the premise? Will you care about these characters? If you do, you'll have a good time. If you don't, then you just wasted 2 hours of your life.",404,4,4,False
imdb_lady_in_the_water_thelittlesongbird_20120110,Lady In The Water,IMDb,TheLittleSongbird,2012-01-10,3,"Not Shyamalan's worst, but his strangest...","Just for the record, I am not a Shyamalan detractor, nor am I a fan. I loved The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, and there were good things about Signs and The Village, even if the films were deeply flawed. It's just that to me after The Village, the rest of Shyamalan's resume ranged to strange to dire. Whether I loved his first couple of films and didn't care/hate the rest has nothing to do with racism, contrary to some of the threads I've come across on his message board. It's just that it is sad that such a promising director, who showed that he could tell a story effectively had either become sloppy or had tried to do many things at once and consequently the respective film buckled(which was the case with The Village). Lady in the Water is not Shyamalan's worst, for me that's The Happening with The Last Airbender not far off, but having seen all his films I do think it is his strangest. Lady in the Water does have its good things though. The score is suitably haunting, Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor and while deserving of a stronger character and less contrived script he does give his all into the performance and it shows. But the best thing about Lady in the Water was the beautifully done animated prologue. However, that is all the praise I can give. The rest of the acting is either unimpressive or awful. Bryce Dallas Howard was fantastic in The Village and she is good as an actress, but while like Giamatti she tries her best her character is nowhere near as poignant or as interesting as that of hers in The Village. Jeffrey Wright and Bob Babalan are wasted, and Shyamalan himself makes an appearance that feels very thrown in and at the end of the day is just a form of annoyance. Scripting-wise Lady in the Water all feels very contrived and overly-silly, the pacing becomes increasingly sluggish in the second half which further suffers from trying to do too much and the characters consist of either stereotypes(the film critic tenant, the kid who could decipher codes from cereal packets and the philosopher of future importance) or fantasy ""mythological"" clichés with grass-haired werewolves for scrunts and twig monkeys for the tarturic that have no depth to them. The scenery and lighting are okay if not exactly dynamic but the camera angles look slip-shod and lazy, with over-use of half-face shots and focusing on nothing. But it is the story that sinks Lady in the Water. The premise was actually interesting, but the execution feels very muddled. I didn't find anything interesting about the nymph's story, it suffers from trying to cram too much and the mythological characters are rather daft. After watching the film, I was saddened at how the director of a thought-provoking and atmospheric movie like The Sixth Sense could've gone to a artificial and self-indulgent movie like this one. By all means, Shyamalan has done worse, but this is definitely not his finest hour. 3/10 Bethany Cox",513,20,13,False
imdb_lady_in_the_water_editor_299_20060717,Lady In The Water,IMDb,editor-299,2006-07-17,6,Shyamalan's water tale take a while to surface,"In a long-winded prologue to Warner Bros.' newest release, Lady in the Water, we are told that long ago, water creatures and earth-dwellers (Man) used to live side by side, but, as Man moved further inland and began killing and stuff, the two groups became separated. This film attempts to show what happens when the two worlds meet again at last. Known for his twists and turns of the plot key, writer/director/actor M. Night Shyamalan (""Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" ""Signs"") goes from the fantasy monsters of an entrenched cult (""The Village"") to the very real evil creatures of a bedtime story that invade a suburban Philadelphia apartment house. Soft-spoken, brow-beaten manager, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti, ""Sideways,"" ""Cinderella"" Man,"" ""American Splendor""), goes through the motions of his dreary job each day, fixing drains, killing bugs, cleaning up messes and showing new tenants to their rooms. Nothing exciting ever happens in this mundane world except for his encounters with a motley group of dwellers; a black man that solves crossword puzzles (Jeffrey Wright, ""Broken Flowers""), an Asian mom and daughter, and Indian writer (Shyamalan) and his sister, a lonely man who never speaks, a Mexican with five daughters, a group of idiotic potheads, a moron that only exercises one side of his body, a milquetoast movie critic, and, of course, the weird cat-loving old lady (Mary Beth Hurt). One day, however, Heep sees someone in the apartment pool and  thinking the person is drowning  jumps in to rescue them. As it turns out, the exotic, pale, red-haired, blue-eyed lady, Story (Bryce Dallas Howard - Ron's daughter - ""The Village""), is a sea nymph (or a ""narf"") who is sent to Philadelphia to find people to help her get back home. I guess this is the reason, as it's never really made clear WHY she chose to arrive where she is when she did. Evidently, the people in the complex will be her healer, guardian, interpreter and guild as she awaits a huge eagle to take her back to the Blue World, from whence she came, to rule as queen. But, there are dangers ahead, as wolves who looks like clumps of grass plan to kill her for some reason. Trying to piece together the nymph's tale of woe (she cannot articulate it to him), he has to rely on the young Asian woman (a hilarious performance by Cindy Cheung, ""Spiderman 2""), who interprets the story as told by her mother. Not as silly as it all sounds, and there are some interesting moments and a few real frights in the enterprise. Some slow moments, especially in the beginning due to Shyamalan's deliberate attempt to develop character. And, in ensemble pictures like this, the danger of so many parts clouding the waters (pun intended) always looms. Some may also accuse the director/writer of once again wallowing in his own ego and gorging on his own past successes, but overall, the movie is not as terrible as many would lead one to believe. Given half a chance, this will probably be a surprise sleeper in the summer film lexicon.",516,6,8,True

imdb_lady_in_the_water_robert_duder_20060730,Lady In The Water,IMDb,Robert_duder,2006-07-30,10,"Fantastic, Original, brilliant and captivating!!","It is so very sad that in a day and age when Hollywood churns out films that critics claim as garbage, and it's the same old recycled, seen before trash that something like this isn't hailed by critics and top of the box office for fans. M. Night Shyamalan's brilliant tale is one of his best but the man has done some brilliant work up till now. It's not secret that Shyamalan seems to be an acquired taste. He has almost a cult following it seems of people that absolutely adore his brilliance. I say he has completely outdone himself with Lady In The Water. Not only has he created this brilliant story with an ensemble cast of mysterious and interesting characters but he created an entire fairy tale that this story bases itself around. This is completely unique and original inside and out and that is something to be proud of. On top of that it is so watchable, captivating and interesting. I sincerely hope that none of the bad reviews brings Shyamalan down because he has outdone himself this time and gave me an incredible experience at the theater. Paul Giamatti takes the lead role as classically haunted and brilliantly melancholy Cleveland Heep. This is a typical Shyamalan character and one of his absolute best going straight up there with Bruce Willis' Dr. Malcolm Crowe, Samuel L. Jackson's Mr. Glass and Mel Gibson's Graham Hess, all absolutely classic characters in cinema and Giamatti's Heep belongs there 100%. Giamatti outdoes himself and gives another Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Heep makes a great hero because he is not. He's the average guy, stuck in a rut, sad, and we know something has caused his melancholy but it unfolds slowly. He is given reason to come alive again with the discovery of a stranger who saves his life. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the mysterious Story. A water Fairy who must accomplish an important deed to the future of mankind and the small apartment complex is the link to this deed. I admit I wasn't crazy about Howard's performance in The Village but she fits this role perfectly. She is mysterious, disturbed, pale, and perfectly suited for this. She still wasn't my favorite character in the film but she does well in the role. One of the most fantastic elements of Lady In The Water is this incredible ensemble cast including none other than Shyamalan himself in an intriguing and important role. Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban, Sarita Choudhury, Cindy Cheung, Freddy Rodríguez, Bill Irwin, Mary Beth Hurt, and Noah Gray-Cabey all deserve mention as they play variations of important parts in the story. I must single out Cindy Cheung who is terrific as the punk rocker student who seems to be quite close to Heep. I think her boisterous ""Goodbye Mr. Heep"" will become a classic in my books. Also Bob Balaban as the rather sour movie critic Mr. Farber and if this was Shyamalan's dig at his rather harsh critics it was hilariously done!! Balaban's character is subtle but meets his end is a rather sarcastic and clever demise poking fun at the movie plot and critics in general. Shyamalan himself plays a very, very good role as the important Vick who has a bigger purpose in life that is dropped on him. The film unravels at break neck speed and everything is discovered and unraveled and carefully dealt with all coming back to this fascinating and original fairy tale that Shyamalan has created. The creature stalking the Water fairy from the grass is terrifying and definitely makes the suspense first rate. One of the most amazing things about this film is that this mind binding, imaginative story all takes place in one tiny area. Never once does this film leave the apartment complex. For the most part the bulk of the film takes place at the pool side and yet you barely notice because Shyamalan makes the story so incredibly interesting. As far as I'm concerned if this wasn't already the case this film puts the nail in Shyamalan being one of the most talented writers and directors in Hollywood. He has such an incredibly unique style and I have loved his films since day one. Bravo for this one because it was amazing!!

Having said that, I felt a mixture of puzzlement and a vague sense of betrayal after viewing this film. I thought ""Sixth Sense"" was an excellent film (I had the good fortune to see it early on), possibly the best movie of it's kind I've ever seen, but M.Nights turnout has been sporadic at best since then. The story is an absurd hodgepodge of archetypical nonsense with words like ""narf"" thrown in and references to the ""blue world"", whatever the hell that is. Apparently it's underwater or something. It is a beautiful film to look at, and there's some great actors in it. I almost felt like I was watching some hidden-camera show where talented actors are assembled to be made fools of. It's hard to even find a starting point in the ridiculousness. The apartment building has a pool. In the bottom of this pool is a human-sized grate which leads apparently into some sort of catacomb. A paunchy middle-aged handyman can swim around in there for quite a while on a single eight-ounce glass of air. There's a monstery sort of dog-like thing which looks like it could be dealt with quite effectively with a weedeater, and some monkey guys in the bushes. I guess it's all symbolic, or something. Then there's this eagle-ish guy who carries the lady who lives in the pool away at the end, although the camera-man had apparently and inconveniently been pushed into the pool at that point, so you really don't get to see too much of him. My feeling is, if you're traveling to a destination deep in the sea, an eagle may not be your ideal mode of transportation. But what do I know? There's no end to the idiocy, as the tenants band together to try to ""solve"" whatever the mystery is supposed to be, with people representing different meaningless archetypes like ""healer"" and ""guide"". Crossword puzzles seem to have something to do with it, and then they don't. I almost felt like Shayalaman was trying to see just how bad a hunk of crap he could sell the public. Just because it's pretentious doesn't make it art. Sorry. Back to the drawing board. His juice from 6thS may have got this movie made, but he's running on fumes with this clunker.

There were many instances where tying seemingly unrelated or insignificant details together got a bit sloppy, unlike all of his previous movies (and I always felt this was MNS's major skill). For example, I was convinced the half-muscle guy was going to play the role of the guardian, but there should have been some greater tie-in on why half of his body needed to be super strong (I envisioned him holding the beast by the scruff of the neck with his strong arm while his 'normally-developed' half did something else necessary for the scene to be believable... instead, all he did was stare and then nearly messed up even that simple task). Also, the young son of the puzzle guy suddenly being the Translator by being able to read symbolic meanings from a wall of cereal boxes was too conveniently deus ex machina, although I can see what MNS was trying to do there, and many fond memories of childhood for us all did indeed entail the morning breakfast study of the cereal boxes in front of us as we ate from our bowls. But compare that with how clever the 'by listening to the critic we were steered wrong' theme turned out to be... which was a nice twist because everything up to that point seemed reasonable and logical, as far as the critic's advice went... it's a well-known pitfall to judge everything by its cover, or to miss important aspects of life by viewing everything strictly from our own stereotyped experiences, no matter how true they might be MOST of the time... I seem to recall a maxim along the lines of ""If you judge things and make your decisions only by what you've seen happen before, you'll be right most of the time, but when you're wrong, you'll be tragically wrong"" or something to that effect. Or how about the 'twist' of Giamatti being, not the Guardian, but the Healer (I call it a twist because by that time I had forgotten that he used to be doctor), the man who himself was in such need of healing, and because of his deep, deep grief being able to spiritually transfer that depth of feeling into saving the Angel, who in fact really wound up saving him, in the end ('thank you for giving me back my life' is how I believe he ended the movie). That's heavy stuff, and extremely moving, especially to those of us who are older and have children of our own. I don't mind MNS's overt bash at critics or the egocentric casting as writer-whose-ideas-will-change-the-world stuff... I don't judge the movie based upon the director's personal life or motives... in fact, I thought the writer was very human and without the hubris that many here are accusing him of having as a director for playing that role himself... furthermore, I think Giamatti was playing a sort of John The Baptist role (unlike a previous poster who likened the writer to John The Baptist), because the writer himself will become a martyr. All in all, if this movie is a failure, then it's a noble one. The fact that MNS tried something different, and it wasn't quite the same calibre as his previous work, is no reason to dismiss TLIW lightly. In fact, I think the movie's reputation will grow as time goes on.",575,2,1,True

That's not to say that I didn't have any problems with the movie though... No, there were definitely some things that I wasn't keen on. For one, while I don't have a problem with the film taking a swipe at sour, cynical critics (in fact, I quite like the idea), I do think that whole subplot was brought down slightly by the painfully unsubtle writing. Even though I actually agree with the message they're trying to put across, having characters just stare at the screen and say it out loud feels kind of... unsatisfying. It's not just the movie critic part that had that issue either, there were a few other patches where the dialogue felt more like it was very artificial, rather than something that was true to the story. And as a final negative, I'll never be able to not wince at the idea of a director casting themselves as a visionary whose book about social issues will change the world and inspire the future president. Like, I actually really enjoyed what they did with Shyamalan's character, and I do like him as a director, but oh my... Apart from that though, there were quite a few positives. Firstly, I loved all the stuff about wanting to believe in fairytales and regaining the pure trust and belief we have as children; it was very sincere. And like I said before, I really was happy to buy into the story after a while, especially as more and more of the characters start to get involved and the film develops into a tale of a small community coming together to help someone, even if they've only just met them, which was actually quite lovely. I also think it was a particularly good idea to keep things to the one location of the apartment building, since it felt like we really got to know the place and the people in it; it seemed personal. On top of that, I really enjoyed the ending scene. In those final few shots looking up from the water as the music came through, it was very peaceful.

imdb_lady_in_the_water_baumer_20070501,Lady In The Water,IMDb,baumer,2007-05-01,1,This can't be the same man that made the Sixth Sense!,"The Sixth Sense was too good to be true. Here was a terrifying horror film directed with a Hitchcockian touch. It was the brainchild of a new director who shocked the industry with his touch. His follow up, Unbreakable, was just as good. M. Night Shyamalan was here to stay. Here we are not even 10 years later and M. Night has given us what he calls a bedtime story. His ego has now gotten bigger than even Taratino's, and that is hard to do. In this latest head swell, Shyamalan, who was told by a studio head that this was a bad idea, ignored them and went crying to Warner Brothers to let him make his movie. Someone there gave the green light hoping that the Village was just a blip. As it turns out, it wasn't. Lady in the Water is one of the most ridiculous, convoluted, insulting messes I have ever seen. The story revolves around metaphors and cryptic ideas that only Shyamalan understands. Here is my interpretation to the best of my ability. The movie places a stuttering man who lost his entire family in some tragic accident. Since then he has lost himself and now flounders in anonymity in his apartment complex. He, as the superintendent, notices someone swimming late at night. This is the Lady from the title. You see, M. Night created an entire ""Bed Time Story"" about how land people used to coexist with the people of the ""Blue World"" (the ocean). These people speak English. But Land people got greedy and started fighting. But the Blue World people stayed pure, like water, as the Super points out. To assist the greedy people, massive birds that no land person has ever seen flies them to the land in Wonder Woman's Invisible Jet (okay i made that part up, but it is just as logical as anything else in here) and they have to show the land people how to be nice again. They must also confront the chosen one because he is after all the Chosen One. Why he is chosen and what he does is not really clear, but then again, logic and clarity are not really all that prominent in this film. The Chosen One is, of course, M. Night himself. He will soon be able to walk on water and raise the dead. Continuing, there are wolves that aren't wolves. They are really Scants or something. Their fur is grass and they are green. So that is why no person has seen them, they blend into the grass, so the next time you are near water, and there is grass there, feel around for a wolf that isn't a wolf and you might find a scant. And don't forget about the rules. The night the Snarf (lady of the blue world) returns to the blue world, they cannot attack them. If they do, these monkeys that aren't monkeys will kill them. There are three. And they are also made out of grass. I think grass is quite prevalent in this film because it must have been what Night was smoking at the time he wrote this and it must have been what the execs at Warner Brothers were smoking when they green lit this. There is more about the scants. Normal Scants wont attack Snarfs unless they are Rogue Scants. And those usually wont do it either, unless the Snarf is a Madame Snarf. And she is. I'm not making this stuff up. Try watching it and see if I'm lying. So now the good guy, Cleveland, played by Paul Giamatti, must find people to help him. You see, there are some normal people that help the Snarfs. Among the people are the Healer, the Guardian, the Guild and the Interpreter. These people are the only people who can see the Snarf leave. No one else can or else it wont work or something. You see these rules are very specific. There is also some old Korean lady who just happens to know this fairy tale and she explains it to her Korean daughter who tells Cleveland that to hear the whole story, he must lay on the couch and behave like a baby. Then the helpers have to get clues from cereal boxes to help out the Lady. This all make sense to Night somehow. To the rest of us, not so much. And the moral is that no one knows who they are....I think. Except for M. Night. He thinks he is God (Chosen One). This is definitely M. Night's worst directed movie. I don't really think he tried to direct a coherent film. I don't even think he tried to write one. This is something that only M. Night gets and comprehends, and that is only because many of the characters are made of grass. To illustrate this point, here is another example of the idiocy of the film. Cleveland wakes up to find a half naked wet woman on his couch. Instead of freaking out and yelling, ""Who the hell are you and how did you get in my house and why do you look like Daryl Hannah from Splash?"", he simply begins to listen to her story and then tells everyone else the story and they all believe him as well. Not once does any character walk away thinking he should be in a straight jacket. They all just drink the kool-aid and then look for snarfs and grassy wolves. Overview: This movie is in my top 25 worst movies I have ever seen. I laughed at how absurd the story was, but never laughed at the so-called 'funny parts.'

It's set in a completely ordinary environment, but then gradually transforms itself into an entire mythology of other worlds, beasts and prophecies. It does this so gently, adding layer upon layer to the fantasy as Cleveland gradually deciphers the mystery, that every turn brings in some new and wacky characters and adds to the fun. Giamatti is wonderful in the lead, as unlikely a Sir Lancelot defender as they come, but he is lovable, noble, sad and good natured all at the same time, and the the entire support cast are a terrific bunch of weirdos, including the director as the portentous writer. I love the way Shyamalan has very little regard for conventional character structure - he populates his stories with the people he needs, never handsome Joe Cool types with unnecessary love interests. In this story the building is full of surprises, both literally and in terms of the people who live there and the horror/fantasy mix is terrific, kind of The Tenant meets The Secret Of Roan Inish, if that's possible. The Scrunt is a fantastic monster, barely glimpsed and subtly horrifying, particularly in a hair-curling scene where Cleveland attempts to confront it. Best of all is James Newton Howard's ethereal score, which somehow transforms a suburban apartment block into a fairy tale universe, simply by using choir and strings. This is a tremendous, rather unique movie, which got a critical drubbing from the sort of people who don't understand that fun, imagination and originality, and not realism, are the crucial elements of cinema, and always have been.

My family and I were really rooting for this movie since we make up bed time stories for our kids. A lot of my stories have been good enough to hold people's interest but I have never tried to turn a profit on them. Nor did I write myself into the screenplay so that the world has to suffer through my acting (AGAIN!). This movie was kind of like the cliff notes of Lord of the Rings or Narnia. The movie seeks to create an entire world full of alternate races of mythical creatures (and their history) like the Narnia books do. The only difference being that Narnia was defined in a large number of full length novels which build off of each other. This movie attempts to CRAM all the information about the way things work into this (hopefully) one movie. It seemed that the movie started out as one sentence regarding someone in the kid's swimming pool and that the rest of the movie was a desperate attempt to explain why and how. The one happy note is that this movie does succeed in putting adults AND kids to sleep so at least I got a good nap.

When he was announced as director of ""The Last Airbender"", I was excited, but had only seen three of his movies, so I have been watching his films, starting with ""The Sixth Sense"", in order of release. When I got to this one, I prepared myself for a movie along the lines of Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"", one with some good elements, but overall disappointing. Instead, I got a rather entertaining movie. First, what this film keeps consistent with in terms of M. Night's other films is the beautiful cinematography, lead acting, and the music score. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing James Newton Howard's score for this movie is. M. Night's supporting role in this did not bother me. It wasn't Oscar-worthy, but not like, as one reviewer said, ""pouring petrol over your head and lighting it"". The movie is too well-acted by the main leads to be considered crap, and the suspense is effective, if not nearly as good as in M. Night's other films. A common complaint I have heard is that the characters believe in the fantastical part of the story too easily, but I disagree. I think they simply put their trust in a man (Cleveland) who has basically taken care of them for years at The Cove, despite how ridiculous it may have seemed. Also, isn't it better to skip over every scene of Cleveland trying to convince everyone that this woman he has met is from another world? The bottom line is that you will not enjoy the movie (or probably any of M. Night's films) without suspending your disbelief a lot, which I simply happen to be good at. If you disliked this movie along with M. Night's next movie, I remind you that the greatest filmmakers always make at least one bad movie. Spielberg has ""1941"" and ""Hook"".

The apartments of the various tenants not only don't resemble each other, they don't look like they belong in the building in which the film is set. Rather than his usual cameo (brilliantly staged in THE VILLAGE), Shyamalan casts himself in a fairly significant role here; he MUST have known how distracting that would be. Paul Giamatti's character of Cleveland Heep is the apartment complex's caretaker, but rather than occupy an apartment in the building, he lives in a rather charming little cottage that appears much older than the rest of the complex; surely a telling detail. And Heep owns both an old manual typewriter AND a personal computer; interesting but ultimately not probative when it comes to the story. Little clues like naming the title character ""Story"" and including a character who's a film critic suggest that there's more to this movie than what we see on the surface.

Alas there were no pleasant surprises, or indeed any real surprises. The story follows building supervisor Cleveland Heep who finds a strange woman called Story in the apartment's swimming pool. She isn't an ordinary woman though, she is a 'Narf', a type of water nymph who has come to the land to help humanity. Her way of helping humanity is to get them to help her get back to her watery realm, to do this they must assemble the correct group of people; she does not tell them this though, Cleveland happens to mention her story to one of the residents and she recalls her mother telling her an 'Eastern bed-time story' about Narfs which is lucky as her mother recalls the story in enough detail for him to understand what he has today. He then sets about recruiting other people to fill the various roles after asking the advice of the resident film critic who he assumes will have seen enough films to know who should fit what role. In order to get Story back home they must keep her safe from the 'scrunt', a strange green, hyena-like creature which hides in the grass. Having enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's previous films 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Village' I was most disappointed with this, it was made worse by the fact that he also acted in it as a writer who's work was destined to change the world for the better and then be assassinated, having set himself in the Christ-role he proceeds to have a go at critics by having the critic die in a confrontation with the scrunt. Before dying the critic gives a fourth wall breaking speech saying how he is bound to survive and find redemption as that is what happens in stories lacking foul language, sex and violence.

Actually, that's a white lie, I was boggled from the very beginning. I read the signs though (no pun intended on M. Night Shyamalan's other film) from reading some reviews, and the general response from online. But I could not have expected such a rancid pile of egotistical malarkey to ever make it past any lowly production company, let alone a major studio, and that it's meant to be taken seriously, absolutely so. It almost reminded me of another film from 2006- Apocalypto- where a director hot on the heels of recent success went for broke on something burning in the filmmaker to be told. Both films, truth be told, aren't good at all, but Lady in the Water- still no pun intended (maybe some)- sinks even further. I can almost picture Shyamalan sitting in front of his computer writing out the script to this film thinking ""I am so clever. I mean, I have narfs, I have scrunts, I have a giant eagle, and porcupine monkeys that hide in the trees, what more could an audience ask for? This is so awesome."" Rarely in the history of modern movies has a director's hubris gone to such lengths and taken an audience down with them. And the shameful thing too is that the little merit that came with Shyamalan's previous film, seriously flawed The Village, was in his abilities as someone who could direct well enough up to a point. Here though, script and direction sink to lows, to the point where as an amateur filmmaker myself I felt like I had achieved a lot in comparison with this. Shyamalan cooks up some incoherent mythological 'fairy tale' (originally meant for his kids, usually not a good idea) involving Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), a maintenance man at an apartment complex, one night finds a very strange, petrified girl in the pool, and soon he finds out a) her name is 'Story', and she's b) called a 'narf' based on an old tale told to him by a Chinese lady, not to mention c) she needs to leave this place before these weird moss-covered dog creatures called 'scrunts' come after her, so d) practically all of the attendees at the apartment complex will somehow play a role in her getting safely away on the talons of an eagle. So you can imagine what could be attained from this material, which is nothing. Zero. There's not even the chance of potential as there was in Gibson's train-wreck picture. From the opening animated introduction to this magical world, things do not look good. It also doesn't help that this time, as a director, Shyamalan doesn't even halfway competently film this stuff. It looks as if the actors, who already seem incredibly stilted and with looks sometimes on their faces like 'why the hell am I in this clap trap' (Giamatti most of all), get very awkwardly, art-farty framed in compositions that do nothing to illustrate any kind of connection with the subject matter. It's self-conscious past the point of inertia, and even if one doesn't really usually pay attention to how a film is directed it won't take long to see something is f***ed up here scene after incredulous scene. And the actors, of course, end up being at the mercy of the director's own pretensions. Giamatti has to deal with cruxes like a stutter, a family of his that died, and a director who forces him and co-star Bryce Dallas Howard into whispering dialog scenes- even when he's all the way across the room from her! Other usually dependable character players like Jeffrey Wright and particularly Bob Balaban also become cannon fodder for Shyamalan's own twisted dealings, with Balaban playing a movie critic who finds there are no original stories left in movies...and then has to shamelessly comment on his own demise when it's met with a scrunt. And there's Shyamalan here, too, for the first time giving himself more than just the hapless cameo role that he's done in past films. To add on to the heap of completely illogical and just plain laughably bad camera set-ups (leaving the camera on nothing, or do a half face of a person, or do very odd cut-aways without transitions), he plays a writer who's book may save the world. Then again, he's only one piece to the Goodyear Blimp wreck that is Lady in the Water. While I've never found him to be the genius wonder-kind that he became after The Sixth Sense, his first few major successes were pretty impressive, with the occasional script flaws and annoying twists compensated by the strong performances and good sense of direction. But maybe only someone with such clout, and sparks of talent, could go so far off the deep-end as he has here. Not to be immodest about it, it becomes a litmus test to see what a filmmaker with carte-blanch can do to annoy the audience. One thing's for sure, except for unintentional purposes watching the movie with friends who feel the same way, there's no entertainment here.

Not because it's bad because it's an imaginative one, and you should really go in having no idea what you're in store for. That's part of the point of the movie. The introduction of this movie is done in cave drawings. It's a fitting opening and a good clue that this movie is about stories. No, not modern film, which many critics and audiences today think is about pushing boundaries and constantly doing something 'new'. This movie is about the good old fashioned story. The reason why our ancient ancestors sat around fires and told them, and their ability to inspire and save souls. There isn't anything truly new about it (it has roots in the classic fairy tales and epic poems of antiquity), other than the fact that it dares to be a great film made in the mondern era in spite of being littered with elements of the now despised classical story (which apparently isn't good enough for modern film makers anymore). The thing about these classic stories and the one that Shaymalan is attempting to tell is that they have a purpose, and strive to inspire society and humanity as a whole. They lead people to do great things, and make us all feel better in the end, where most modern 'stories' feel more like egotistical attempts of ""artists"" to make themselves feel great and leave us in awe of their great greatness. Christopher Doyle lends some excellent shots to this film, which some how manage to make a scene of an every day loser frigthenedly warding off a were-wolf type monster with a pool skimmer seem exceptionally epic. At the same time it helps the story (for me at least) pull those same strings that great stories like Gilgamesh, and the Aeneid pull. I saw this film the day it opened and I was delighted. I came home, as is my habit, and read all the reviews. A good section of this movie is directed at attacking assanine, jaded, film critics who think their opinions are authoratitive (it depicts them as being the ruiners of the classic story), and so, all of the assanine, jaded, and authoratative film critics seem to have panned it. No one seemed really sure what the movie was about, but were all quick to pan M. Night as being arrogant for casting himself in the role of a writer destined to change the world. They, ironically, claim that he was being arrogant, completing unable to fathom that their own presumptions about why he cast himself in that role could in fact be a good deal more arrogant... I'll have to admit that I've been the jaded film critic before, but one I came out of this one I remembered why I've always loved stories, and why they don't' always have to be new and fit into some silly sense of ""reality"".",491,116,77,False

Characters in this film do not act like people, they lack any human response to the childlish fairytale-like situations thrown at them. There is no sense that a fairytale has entered our world, no raised eyebrows here. The fairytale itself being taught is just too random and sporadic. Fantasy, even the most creative, make an effort to pull us into the fantastic, and make us believe these worlds and rules to be real. What happens in this film though is total disconnect. Characters are not relatable, nor interesting enough to merit this. The exposition is clumsy, lazy, and lengthy. The story is random and lacks any structure. The dialogue is awkward, as if written by some other-worldy being attempting to mimic the human race. To the counter argument of ""a fairytale is allowed to be childish and fun and fantastic"", let me retort by pointing out that I've read and watched fairy tales more grounded and competent then this.

Night Shyamalan's The Lady in the Water, Haley Joel Osment's character from The Sixth Sense might be inclined to say ""I see lousy films, and one of them is in this theatre."" Actually, calling The Lady in the Water ""lousy"" is too simplistic. The movie is more of a train wreck, with partially realized elements, loose ends aplenty, and wildly improbable leaps in its own narrative. And yet, in true Shyamalan fashion, the movie commands viewer respect in spite of its flaws. Shyamalan credits the movie's plot to a bedtime story he created to entertain his children, but instead of conveying a simple story, the tale unfolds as a muddled new age fable that never really goes anywhere or accomplishes anything. The movie's greatest strength is the casting of Paul Giamatti as Cleveland Heep, the stuttering schlep caretaker of a Philadelphia apartment complex known as The Cove. Giamatti's everyman quality makes it easy for the viewer to quickly get sucked into the story, which involves Heep's discovery of a mysterious woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) one night in the complex's pool. Turns out this ""Narf"", or water nymph, has been sent from the ""blue world"" to the world of men to impart some sort of mystical knowledge that the film never makes very clear. Trying their best to kill her before she fulfills her mission are shadowy, supernatural ""Scrunts"", large hyena-like creatures comprised of grass and earth. Sounds strange? Watching the film doesn't help as Shyamalan never bothers to explain why the Scrunts are out to kill his heroine, much less the grand importance of her mission. In the decade that's passed since Shymalan burst onto the scene with his brilliant The Sixth Sense, the director has cultivated an equally proportioned number of fans and detractors. Few movie directors have been able to so totally polarize movie going audiences into love him or hate him camps as Shymalan. A lot of this has to do with his penchant for building his movies around plot twist device that fans either love, or find hackneyed. As if listening to his critics, Shymalan has eschewed his traditional plot twist this time out in favor of a more conventional narrative, albeit one that more closely resembles a phone conversation with a really bad connection. The whole experience actually left me wishing for a twist that would turn the movie on its head and make me feel like everything I'd spent the last two hours watching was much more than the sum of its ambiguous parts. Still, for all its numerous flaws, The Lady in the Water is still a compelling film. Shymalan's talent for imagery, characterization and musical scoring all give this movie a watchable dimension. I also have to admire him for his vision, for unlike many of his directorial contemporaries, he hasn't opted to ""sell out"" and cash in by helming any one of Hollywood's countless superhero action adventure popcorn movies that fill the cinemas each summer. He has a vision and stands by it, even unto failure. There's something to be admired in that.",519,37,39,False

Night Shyamalan film with some sort of fear because he went downhill from there. When I got to see Lady in the Water, I gave him a chance and I said to myself: ""How bad can it be?"" The story, based on a bedtime story written by Shyamalan, was quite interesting, but kind of short for a two hour film. Because of this, it drags on, giving the film a very slow pace. It also features Shyamalan's trademark plot twist, but this one seems forced and somewhat predictable (at least it was for me). I think the greatest fault I find with this film is Shyamalan casting himself in an important role. He made cameo appearances before this one, but here he has quite a lot of screen time, even though he's an awful actor. Bryce Dallas Howard (Story) didn't give a good performance either. Her acting is dull, uninteresting and over-dramatic. When I looked at the film's budget and saw $75 million, I couldn't help but think where did so much money went? The whole movie takes place in an apartment complex so there aren't many sets, the visual effects are very few and look kind of cheap and the film doesn't have any stars to say that they asked for a big salary. The cinematography isn't that great either. Actually, this almost looks like a low budget film. In my mind, this film has two redeeming qualities: Paul Giamatti's performance and James Newton Howard's masterful music score. He's a standard collaborator of Shyamalan and I think that this is his best work. Overall, this is a boring and uninteresting film, but still decent and watchable. It is certainly not Shyamalan's worst film, but still miles away from The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.

What it does have in common with his other films is its detailed complexity. Little things mean a lot, just as in Signs or Unbreakable or any of the others. That's about the only similarity. In all other ways, it's a new departure. Matter of fact, this film is a new thing in film-making. It's not new, however, in bedtime stories--which is what the writer says it is, and he should know. This isn't a horror film, although there are some scary things; it's not a romantic film, although there are some sweet moments; it's not a comedy, although there were some things I just couldn't stop giggling about. It's a STORY. Wow. That is so rare today--nothing blows up, no car chases, just a good story. So who am I to make comments? I'm a mom, a grandma, a teacher (literature and history, middle school), and a martial artist (2nd degree black belt). I've told lots of bedtime stories, I've read a ton of books to students, I've read student stories, and I explore legends and traditions from all around the world. I love a good story. That means I'm probably like a lot of movie viewers--probably like most of the people reading this. At first, this film just seemed odd to me. That changed about ten minutes into the movie when I made a conscious decision to put aside my ideas of what the film was going to be like and just experience it, savor it for what it was. That's when it became a delight. I plan to see it again, and to buy it when it comes out in DVD. I will show it to students in my literature classes, as an example of good storytelling. It has all the elements of ""Story"" (in the literary sense, not the character in the film); it has a protagonist who is Everyman, a damsel in distress, a heroic quest, a frightening monster, and lots of wonderful everyday heroes. How can you not love a story in which a child reading a cereal box has the answer to a life-or-death question? One of the most perplexing elements was the ease in which everyone in the apartment complex (in my opinion, a microcosm of society) accepts the situation, which is obviously incredible. I loved it. That kind of suspension of disbelief, which is such an element of bedtime stories and fairy tales, is usually missing from our cynical culture. The belief in goodness and mystery is rare. One of the characters says, when things don't look so good, ""I really wanted to believe."" I think that's true for many of us. We want to believe in goodness and light. I really loved this movie for showing a vision of a group of people who believe. This movie is on my list of lovely films, along with The Princess Bride and Finding Neverland. What do they all have in common? Hope. That's a rare commodity today. Please see this movie with an open mind and open heart. Blessings, Ninja Grandma",574,23,10,True

I still don't understand why this movie has poor rating. This was released in 2006 and maybe the audience at the time had a different kind of expectation or maybe as in the case of the movie The Village, even this movie was marketed wrongly. I read some extremely critical reviews and they seemed more like a personal attack than an well thought out critic. This man certainly has the audience divided for some reason.

To be honest i don't know why people have such strong feeling against this film, this film is just like M Nights earlier ones, and one of the best! I agree, it is a little crowded with too many characters, but it aided the story perfectly. Another perfect thing was the balance of comedy and suspense in this film. M Night is a master. One of the few things i didn't like though was M Nights gigantic acting role in this film. It was just too much, and i couldn't help thinking it was him, and not the character. Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard were, plainly, perfect, but despite the supporting cast being fantastic also, it made Paul and Bryce look worse than they actually were. There were, some unnecessary touches, but none that were too affecting on the overall look of this movie.

I say pleasure because after watching it I found comfort in the fact that I knew the odds of seeing a worse film decreased substantially. Admittedly, The Last Airbender and The Happening were serious contenders, but didn't quite have all the elements of awfulness that this little gem has. I don't enjoy bashing M Night. I studied The Sixth Sense and I am actually a big fan of Unbreakable, which I will happily watch whenever it's on. Why is this film so bad? Well, think of any reason which makes a film bad, and you wouldn't be wrong. The plot does not even attempt to engage you and is absolutely ridiculous - not in a ""oh that could never happen..."" kind of way (because let's be honest there are plenty of unrealistic good movies, that's hardly a flaw in itself) but in a ""why have you written this ridiculous pointless ting"" kind of way. The characters are... nothing. That's what they are. They barely fit the definition of characters. They are not explored, they have no journey, they just happen to be fictional and in a ""film"". As many people do, I really like Paul Giammatti. I mean, he's an excellent actor with an impressive range. He is does comedy as well as he does drama. I really can't go on enough as to how good he is. Barney's Version being a just one example of his talent. So, this film is redeemed by an excellent performance by good ol' Paulie, you are thinking, with new found hope! No. I am surprised he has left this film out there to be seen. Don't get me wrong, he is still a good actor in it, he's a professional at the end of the day. It's that the rest of this film is so bad that it crushes his good work. So sorry, I realise I've written so much and not even told you what the film is about! So, there's a water nymph that lives in a swimming pool of a crappy motel, that needs to go home. Oh, OK, you're thinking, that doesn't sound bad at all! OK. How about no context at all is given and all the questions you have won't be answered. Not enough? OK, how about we throw in a very unsubtle dig at film critics by... putting a bad person who is a film critic in the film in quite a pointless role. Just to be sure, let's throw in some entirely pointless characters like a guy who has one hugely developed muscular arm. I won't ""spoil"" the end for you, not just because M Night does an excellent job of that himself and I could never compete. What I can say is it will make you angry, make you wonder if any thought whatsoever was put into this, make you question why you even bothered watching this thing and whether you should ever watch anything again. Ever. It may even make you question life itself. Then, that's where the magic happens. That is when you will realise that you've seen and touched the bottom of film making.

This is a director who had one great film in him, and that was ""The Sixth Sense."" ""Unbreakable"" was passable. Everything since then has been one awful bomb after another. Shyamalan has reached a true nadir with ""Lady in the Water."" It's heavy-handed, amateurish, and utterly predictable. Who cares if it's based on a bedtime story? This is poor film-making, and the millions of dollars that got dumped into this terrible mish-mash of ""ET"" and ""Splash"" with a few dandruff flakes shed by ""The Lord of the Rings"" sprinkled in for bad measure could have gone to someone who had a good idea for a movie. This certainly wasn't it! I knew this was going to be a long movie when the main character turns out to be something called a ""Narf."" Has Shyamalan never heard of ""Pinkie and the Brain,"" perchance? And then the main character's name is Story, for the love of all things cinematic! The film critic character who tells us precisely everything that is wrong with this very film is a nice touch, and Shyamalan reaches his ultimate self-indulgence when he kills that character off... no doubt his moment of revenge for the panning of his last few toilet-worthy films. The film is called ""M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water"" because there are no top actors in it, so Shyamalan's name is attached to give it some recognition draw. The thing is, there's a good reason why there are no well-known actors in this; anyone who read the hackneyed, atrocious, tedious story and dialog and could find anything else to do went and did it. The characters spew line after line of sickly schlock from their mouths for a solid two hours. There's not a single clever line in the entire film, and this isn't helped when we're treated to words like ""scrunt"" and ""narf"" being chucked about frequently. Even Shyamalan's storied ""twists"" have run dry. In ""The Village,"" the twist was that he misled the audience about the setting of the movie. In ""Lady in the Water,"" he misleads us about who the important characters are, effectively wasting our time following the wrong leads that he's given us for most of the movie. Perhaps we'll get lucky with his next feature and he won't actually be the director! Now *that* would be an enjoyable twist. Whether you're thinking about seeing this in a theater or renting it on DVD, just don't bother. This is a terrible, terrible movie that will disappoint at every opportunity unless you are really into watching a director wallow in his own crapulent narcissism. Perhaps if Shyamalan's movies stop making any money, Hollywood will be forced to find someone new to make a good movie instead of lavishing a big budget on a director who hasn't figured out yet that film is a visual medium, so you don't literally *tell* the story by having your cast talk the whole thing through on screen.

Knight Shyamalan lost his mind? Is he a mad genius or just loopy? Has he created a masterpiece or a mess? These are the questions I'm still grappling with after watching THE LADY IN THE WATER. This is most interestingly beautiful, confusing, and downright strange films I've have ever seen. Wow, trying to come up with words to explain what's going on in my mind after watching this film is impossible. I'm not sure if I've seen the future of the cinema or the end of a popular director's career. But I do know that THE LADY IN THE WATER cannot be ignored. I think walking into this film, I had many preconceived notions. I know what an M. Knight Shyamalan film is, or at least what it's supposed to be. But THE LADY IN THE WATER challenges every one of those notions. There's no surprise ending, there are very few scares, and the film feels sloppy, half-hearted, overly confusing, and I understand why most will dismiss it. This is a movie that can't quite be nailed down and since the film bucks any and all convention. It's easy to find the conventional flaws everywhere. The acting is disjointed, the plot is a mess, the dialogue is overly simple, the story is far too complicated and it all combines into something that seems pieced together on the fly. It feels almost as if Shyamalan has drawn a line in the sand. This line is all logic. This line is how far he expects us to go, and then out of nowhere the line suddenly falls apart. Shyamalan pushes us so past the line, it's easy to just give up. I think the line comes at a different point for each of us. The line disappeared to me when the little boy begins to read cereal boxes. It is so weird, so out of left field. This was at that point in which I had to decide if I should give up any semblance of logic and just give in to the sheer absurdity of it, or whether I should give up and pan it. Where that lines falls with you, may decide if you have a positive reaction to the film or not. The plot is simple, or maybe not. A ""Narf"" named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) shows up in a pool at The Cove, and apartment community in Philadelphia. What's a ""Narf?"" Well it's kind of like a mermaid with human feet, or maybe more like an angel or a muse that lives underwater, both would be appropriate. Anyway Story is rescued by The Cove's resident superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Story is looking for a writer who's written work will cause a positive change in the world forever. On that trail Cleveland must protect Story from an evil creature bent on destroying her. But what is this movie exactly? It is a bedtime story come to life. It's a fanciful yarn, a child's story and a wild imagination run amok. Like how MULLHOLLAND DRIVE was dream realized on film, THE LADY IN THE WATER is a campfire tale, it's not a terribly cohesive, and demands that the audience put the pieces together. I liken it to the weird tales I created with my action figures as a kid, or a nonsense story that a first grader may try to write. It's not designed to be pulled apart, just experienced at that moment. None of the pieces quite fit, a lot of times if feels as if the film is grasping for straws. Sensing that it's lost most of the audience it gives into its oddness, and it revels in it. But is that by design? The other side of the coin is that this is a badly made movie. It's the wild ranting of an over zealous personality. The first credit you see as the film comes to a close is ""Written, Produced, and Directed by M. Knight Shyamalan"" and since he's been so successful maybe this film is an example of what happens when you allow a director too much room, and no editorial comment from the studio. Maybe this is a self-indulgent vanity piece, a sloppy mess of a movie that would have been easily dismissed had it not been created by Shyamalan himself. Honestly, I don't know where I fall. I think I want to see the movie again. But I like the notion that this could be a step in the right direction for film as a whole. That Shayamalan has crafted a film that way ahead of its time. I'd hate to realize that there is nothing there because it would rob that odd sense of madcap joy I experienced with the film. THE LADY IN THE WATER is the perfect remedy for what's wrong in Hollywood. Even if you hate every single moment of it, it encourages strong reactions. Whether that reaction is confusion, anger, or awe, this film cannot be easily ignored. So at this moment I think I will argue that THE LADY IN THE WATER is a brilliant film. That Shyamalan will get ribbed for it now, but will later be rewarded with a strong cult following. It's easily the best film I've seen all year.",879,213,166,True

I'm not able to offer my best rating but I can say that Shyamalan reveals in this movie a sensitive ability to capture the mythical symbolism of the basic human condition. He continues to reach out with his movie towards more essential important and serious matters in his films. The small weaknesses, especially at the beginning with the overly cute animated explanation, the initial stereotypical characters, and the somewhat weak ending (although the seeming lack of the presence of Ron Howard's daughter (The Lady) close to the end of the movie was a bold stroke) reduced the overall significant impact of the movie. Yet, throughout, Shyamalan demonstrates his ability to both insinuate originality and great use of direction from his camera technique and his actors' performances. Most of all, the hidden, innermost, basic, emotions are capture in this movie. It's a moving, horror/mythical movie grown up without forgetting our inner child.

Night Shyamalan did amazing work with the horror genre in both films. He breathed new life into a dying breed of movie, giving them something new among all of the cliché-ridden movies that share the genre. So, I really wanted to like this movie. I, along with pretty much everyone else, was very disappointed by The Village and I very much wanted the director to redeem himself. He failed. Miserabley. Now, I could see his intentions throughout the entire movie. I knew what he was going for and really, it could have worked very well if it had been done correctly. The biggest problem I saw was that he tried to make it be too many different things at once. It was part fairy tale, part horror, part comedy, part fantasy...it goes on. If he had chosen just one and focused his efforts on it, I think the movie would have been very good. Instead, it ended up being a long-winded, pretentious, illogical mess. The movie is self-aware in some ways, often mocking itself and its own ridiculous story and explanations. This works in other movies, like Scream, for example. In this one, though, the subject is so outlandish that even the prodding the movie gives itself can't make it forgivable. You have to buy into a lot of insane stuff before you can even begin to get sucked into the story. In some movies, such a leap of faith is easy to make and the movie is thoroughly entertaining. Not many people question the rationality of Star Wars because the movies make their universe believable. Lady In The Water's universe is so confusing and muddled that it's distracting and the viewer spends more time calling it out than getting involved. There are times when I found myself laughing and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to or not. The scenes play out as completely serious, but it's hard to believe that anyone could have written such scenes and intended them to be taken seriously. It's impossible not to laugh at dialog that includes creatures such as narfs and scrunts. Ultimately, I would call the movie confusing.

But I did not not like Unbreakable or Signs. Shyamalan is like Marmite - you either love his film or you hate it. He polarises opinion even amongst his own fans - of which I was one. I haven't yet seen'The Happening' so I cannot comment, however, I just managed to sit through Lady in the Water. Just. But where do I even start with this one? If I have to sum it up in one word, it would be 'mess'. A bedtime story for his kids - the plot (if you can call it that) is preposterous, the characters unbelievable, the premise incredulous and the dialogue atrocious. The direction leaves a lot to be desired and what was the whole point of the movie? There was none. The basic rundown of the story is this: Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), a maintenance man at an apartment complex, finds a very strange, scared girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) in the pool one night, and soon he finds out a) her name is 'Story' - what kind of name is that? b) she's called a 'narf' - based on an old tale piecemealed to him by a Chinese tenant c) she needs to leave this place before some weird moss-covered dog creatures called 'scrunts' come after her d) practically all of the tenants at the apartment complex will somehow play a role in her getting safely away on the talons of an giant eagle. I kid you not. That is truly it. The Narf somehow inspires a guy who is suffering from 'writer's block' to finish his book which will someday inspire a future president of America. This guy is the reason she comes from her own mythical world - and who is this guy? You guessed it - Shyamalan himself in a strange, ego-massaging role as the chosen one. A latter day John the Baptist if you like. My brain hurts on so many levels writing this review as the film is just complete codswallop. Some examples of my frustration are: 1. When the sea-nymph arrives from the water and spouts her preposterous story - Giamatti immediately believes her and lets her stay in his apartment - semi-naked. Not only that but when Giamatti retells the story to all others - they ALL believe it without question. What? 2. Giamatti then sees the underground home of the nymph beneath the swimming pool - but continues on as if this is a normal everyday occurrence. What? No T.V., no questions? 3. Howard stays in the apartment - naked by the way - and simply stares off into space for 90% of her scenes. She whispers incoherently for the other 10%. 4. Characters appear on screen explaining the story to us - telling us the story instead of allowing the audience to figure it out for themselves. Basic, fundamental flaw of film-making if you ask me. Or maybe it was because the story is ridiculous - and no-one could ever figure it out or be bothered to figure it out. 5. A kid is able to read obscure, prophetic messages from a collection of cereal boxes. I'm serious. 6. The kids father does nothing only crossword puzzles each day. 7. One guy exercises only his right arm. 8. Giamatti must have had blisters on his knuckles after this shoot as he is involved in numerous 'knocking on doors' scenes. After a while - it just turned into a joke. 9. Shyamalan's scene changing and framing were strange to say the least. Downright poor to be truthful about it. 10. The finale - was that it? That's what we sat through 100 minutes for? To say I was disappointed is to say the Pope is Catholic. What a letdown !!

For awhile, I felt like I'd missed part of the plot because things didn't fit together. I realized that I hadn't missed anything because I was following it just fine and seeing nothing I didn't understand. The reason I felt that way is because the plot is just really bad. The characters have zero reason to spend so much time on such a nonsensical purpose. I don't want to risk giving something away by explaining the ocean-wide holes in the plot, not to mention the utter stupidity of it. Shyamalan seems to think that since he's one of those directors whose name works as a magnet for audiences (even if no one I know pronounces it right, and really I don't see what's so hard about it), he can do no wrong and everyone's going to praise anything he defecates onto what can loosely be described as a screenplay. He throws in a cast of oddballs, and what I mean by that is a bunch of people who are weird for no reason. There is one character who exercises one side of his body into a muscular, toned beach body while leaving the other half skinny and weak. There's another character who sits in his apartment with a perpetual wide-eyed look and always acts as if the apocalypse is upon us, and in one scene he dramatically speaks with piercing inflection and fierce head-bobbing, which is supposed to be inventive and different. Really, it makes the character look like a complete idiot. All the computer-generated creatures induce so many exclaimed rhetorical questions that I can't even count them all. One thing I liked about the film was its cinematography. It's single-long-shot-themed style has a way of placing us in a clever voyeuristic point of view, as the camera always seems subtly misplaced. It's fantastic cinematography, I must say. Other than that one high point, the movie is ridiculous beyond belief. Did any of these actors joke and shake their heads during lunch when Shyamalan wasn't around? Are they too under the spell of this overconfident, self-indulgent, slowly diminishing auteur? The Sixth Sense was good, Unbreakable was underrated, Signs was great, The Village was mediocre. Now he hits bottom.",377,3,3,False

I have liked every movie he has done (except this one), and I think they all have their own merits. On top of this, he is one of the better technical and original directors of our time. His pacing is usually magnificent, as well as his shot framing and selection. However, Shyamalan's writing has never been superb. His dialogue is contrived, verbose and sophomoric. While his plots are mediocre at best, and usually use a gimmicky ending to save them. His themes are shallow, and lend themselves to the worst type of pretentiousness. This is to say, Shyamalan could be a great director, if he would use someone else's script. Lady in the Water: The technical directing extolled above, is no where to be found in this movie. Sadly, what I enjoy most in Shyamalan's work seems to be purposefully removed. The plot is more than typically bad for Shyamalan's writing, and the dialogue is ten times worse than any of his other films. The dialogue is so terrible, that even great performances by Giamatti and Howard cannot save it. Further, the movie takes absurd jabs at critics, and one cannot help but think the audience itself. It has an ""I don't care, you still got suckered into buying a ticket"" attitude, which I found maddening. I left the theater feeling hoodwinked, not because I expected a surprise ending or good writing, but because I actually expected Shyamalan to try and make a good movie.",257,16,14,False

After that, I was a HUGE fan...I had to see the others. While SIGNS had always been my favorite, I love how he blended moving stories, with thriller aspects. After the critics bashed the VILLAGE (which I found to be a very well made movie) I wondered if he could recover or not. And here is is answer. This movie, much like the other ones, is a ""theme"" movie, that goes deeper than nymphs, ghosts, or creatures in the woods outside. This movie explores ""Purpose"", a theme we don't hear from much from movies. Paul Giamatti is fantastic and real in this movie, and that's why he is one of my fav actors. He could actually nab a Oscar nomination for this movie. He is INCREDIBLE. Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning...and while I think she was robbed last year at the Oscars for Village, I think this year, she will miss out on the award. She didn't stand out, because there was not as much depth to her character as their was for Paul. Shyamalan actually performed a huge part in the movie, and a very moving part. The story was well crafted...and I actually think this may have been Night's most original and daunting task of a story he has written yet. I also think this is one of his best. It's not scary. It's moving. And actually has some comedy in it, which he missed in some of his other movies. In how many thrillers do you see a guy who performs an experiment, and only works out one side of his body, so it becomes 4"" more muscular than the other. I love how he brought some many diverse people together: a critic who sees no originality in the world, a crossword puzzle genius, a stumped writer and his comedic sister, an old woman who has a thing with animals, and a man locked away in his solitude. The way they come together is incredible. One of the best parts of the movie is the music. BY FAR, the BEST music in any of Shyamalan's movies. James Newton Howard has created a masterpiece soundtrack, that's sweeping chorus of angelic voices and swelling violins and cellos will leave you awestruck. And don't believe Shyamalan's lies about there being ""no twist"". there's about 10 twists...the entire movie will keep you guessing until the very end, which is to say the least, perfect. People will tell you that the movie isn't worth 6 bucks, I'm sure, because it's not scary. They'll say that your getting gypped. I say you're not getting gypped.

This is also the funniest film he has ever produced- the audience could not stop laughing, unfortunately there were also a lot of snorts, and though I could not see them, my sixth sense told me a lot of rolling eyes as well.

Take that sentence and you will get an idea of how Shyamalan presents this movie. He tells you this is a movie and lets you know what he is going to do with it and then counts on you to apply your imagination(if you want to). In a way I think this movie was ingenious but I did leave the theater bothered. I remember when the teaser came out. I heard Josh Groban singing a song that was quite dreamy so I had the impression this was going to be a fantasy even though people were talking about this being a scary movie. So leaving the movie confused should be understandable because it initially was not clear what we were going to get. Having seen it, I am still not sure what we got. I only saw it once and will likely not see it again. If I see it again, it will be on the DVD. Why? Because I am confused and I did not get enough incentive to unravel the mystery. Shyamalan was able to get laughs out of me when I was trying to figure out what he was doing. So that helped trivialize discontent. His off-the-cuff and nearly subliminal commentaries were interesting and sometimes comical. I could be wrong but one such scene seems to be a cheap shot at a scene in Woody Allen's Match Point (Scarlett Johanssen's character and the boyfriend's scene in the rain talking about love). Why would Shyamalan do that? I have no idea. That was just one of the unusual moments. Others were not so vague. Shyamalan had a lot to show and tell here but I am not sure he told it right. I think it is entirely possible he is taking advantage of the viewer. On the other hand he may not be doing any of this for the viewer. He could be so entirely self-confident that what he is doing is just expressing himself, not caring what anyone thinks. What a way to make a living!! All in all, this movie is less of a mystery than Shyamalan himself. As I was disappointed with every movie of his since 6th Sense, I was not surprised with the outcome of this movie. However, this is not a movie to be missed if you are a fan of his or his style. I rated this movie higher than you might think, 7 of 10. The movie has some good comic relief and has its fair share of beauty. The movie, as confusing as it is, has a true interest factor. Shyamalan's movie being quite different than the mainstream features deserves high marks. Being as slow as it was, you are given time to absorb, but this sponge had absorbed too much at the half way point. I had lost interest in the movie but wanted to decipher the message. Now, if anyone can tell me what this was all about, I may give it a slightly higher mark. I might even want to see it again. Expect mystery, scary moments, comic relief, boring times, Shyamalan, unnecessary dialogue(I think), creatures, Shyamalan, and more Shyamalan. Oh yeah, The Lady In the Water??, Giamotti was in the water more often than she. Hmmmm, maybe this was a movie about some guy's underlying desire to be a woman. 7/10 and that's as clear as I can make it.",593,3,3,False

Night is a mysterious man with a legion of adoring fans and apologists. What is most mysterious to me, though, is that he is given endless tries to be as successful as he was in the beginning. Many fans enjoyed one or two of his films (I'm partial to ""Unbreakable""), but few enjoy them all. Yet, every time he makes a new film it seems this one is a ""must-see"" because it ""might"" be as great as the others. I want to say this because I think ""Lady in the Water"" is the film that people will finally realize this man is not perfect. The story revolves around a woman from another world who comes to find a writer who will be inspired to write a story. Along the way she also recruits the help of a variety of people to be guardians, healers, a guild and other archetypes as outlined in an old Asian myth. If that was not clear, don't worry: it really is that strange, and all this before the camouflage wolves and monkeys. The cast is nothing special and the characters are interesting but forgettable. I found myself by the end of the film forgetting who characters were that I had been introduced to only an hour before. More often than not, the audience is not given enough time to become acquainted with any of the characters, leaving them all very one-dimensional. Even the lady's motivations are largely unknown and unclear, and once her mission is finished we are still left with another hour of story that seems pointless if you think about it. personally, i found the film's only redeeming aspect to be the character of the film critic. His breaking of the fourth wall (indirectly, he never addresses the audience) was quite amusing when he explained what each character represented and gave his idea of the difference between a PG and an R horror film, even invoking the ""Scream"" theory of horror - that no sex and drugs means you'll live. give ""the village"" a second chance before you rent this movie, and only rent it if you really, truly feel m. night deserves one more chance at greatness.",366,6,3,False

If we understand that, then ""Lady in the Water"" isn't half bad, although still nothing particularly impressive. This time, they go for a more mystical feeling, with Bryce Dallas Howard as a being sent to Paul Giamatti so that he can help her move to the next phase of existence. The movie's problem is that some of the scenes look like stuff that we've seen a hundred times: a person talks, there's a pause accompanied by glossy music, and the other person overacts in responding. As for the bad guys, they just seemed a little silly (sorry, but CGI has gotten old pretty quickly). So, those are the movie's downsides. But the whole part about whom she has to find gave the flick an interesting aspect that was noticeably missing from, say, ""Signs"".

LITW would fit in on par with Signs, as the more I think about this movie, the more I reflect upon it, the more I realize how much I love it.

Compare that to the packed houses that greeted both Unbreakable and Signs when I saw those films. What to make of this low attendance? Were that many people really turned off to M. Night Shyamalan because of the ""twist"" at the end of The Village (a movie I liked, by the way). Maybe people were just apprehensive after seeing the mediocre to negative reviews that Lady in the Water has been getting in the media. Perhaps they are put off by Shyamalan's perceived arrogance and egomania. Whatever the case, folks are really missing out on nice bit of storytelling. First of all, a lot of the negative reviews for this film state that it doesn't live up to the standards of horror films. However, Lady in the Water is NOT a horror movie, it's a fantasy. More to the point, it's actually a bedtime story brought to life. The basic story is that a mysterious woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) is discovered in the pool of a suburban Philadelphia apartment building by the building's superintendent, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Heep discovers that she is not of this world, and sets out to return her to her own realm. The scary parts of the story are provided by the wolf-like creature that tries to kill her whenever she is out of the water. Apparently, some reviewers are mistaking this standard fairy tale convention as an attempt at horror, but Lady in the Water is no more an attempt at horror than anything Shyamalan has done since The Sixth Sense. In fact, all of Shyamalan's films, including The Sixth Sense, are better described as ""suspense"" or ""mystery"" than as traditional horror films. The meat of all of his films is the storytelling, and the emotional connection to the characters in the movie. The scary bits are just the gravy. In Lady in the Water, the scary parts are more scarce than in any of his other films, but there seems to be more humor, both subtle and otherwise, than in any of the movies that preceded it. Shyamalan has also been criticized for casting himself in such a large role in this film. While he had cameos in each of his other four movies, his biggest part previously had been as the local man who killed the wife of Mel Gibson's priest in a car accident in Signs. His role in the current film casts him as not only a major character, but without (hopefully) giving away too much, let's just say he's almost Christ-like. Obviously, Shyamalan's critics are having a field day with this one, saying that his egomania has finally taken him over. Would the critics, however, really have liked the film more if Shyamalan had switched roles with Bob Balaban (as a pompous movie critic) or Jeffrey Wright (as the resident who is gifted at solving crossword puzzles) or even Bill Irwin (as the eccentric resident Mr. Leeds)? I think not. If he plays a similar part in his next film, I'll join those who criticize his ego. Until that happens, he's merely playing the role that best suits his vision of the story. In the end, it's all about the story, or rather the Story. That's the name of Howard's character in the film. She plays the part with a wide-eyed detachment that suits this sort of ""outsider"" character. The film is teeming with interesting, slightly off kilter people, and much of the film's surprising humor is derived from the supporting cast. It's the interplay between Giamatti and Howard that gives the film its emotional center though. Despite his looks, it appears Giamatti may make a leading man out of himself yet. The man can flat out act. He played mostly bit parts until his breakout role as ""Pig Vomit"" in 1997's Private Parts. I loved him as Bob Zmuda, Andy Kaufman's best friend, in Man on the Moon, and of course in his lead part of wine connoisseur Miles in Sideways. As with the rest of Shyamalan's movies, it's the slow buildup of the quirky story that pulls you in, but it's Giamatti's superb acting that keeps you there. His scene of emotional release near the end (don't want to give anything away) is truly heartbreaking. You really feel the pain of this man whose life had lost its purpose. The bottom line is that Shyamalan is now five for five in good movies. While The Sixth Sense is probably still his best made film, and Signs remains my personal favorite, this one is right up there with them. His critics say that all of his films stick to the same basic formula. I agree, but I don't feel that's a bad thing. As long as the plot lines and characters remain interesting, I enjoy going into a M. Night Shyamalan movie knowing that it will be done in his signature style.

M. Night is unlike most of the ""Hollywood suck-up types"" because of his willingness to take creative chances with his story telling regardless of whether or not the story seems formulaic enough for potential box-office gold. Having said that, I think his latest endeavor has much to be desired. First of all I must agree with a previous member who said his role in the movie went a little overboard.

The other point that became a little drawn out and predictable was the way the characters had been mistakenly identified... Movie viewers know what I am talking about here. The ""guardian"" turned out to not really be the guardian, and the ""healer"" wasn't really the ""healer"" and so forth. The misidentification of roles theme got a little old really quick. All in all the acting was very believable especially by Giamatti. However, from an entertainment value standpoint, I was a bit disappointed with the movie.

Lady in the Water is a very imaginative and intriguing story, that becomes some what muddled on logic at times. Story-wise this film also doesn't have quite the same heart of Shyamalan's earlier works. One thing Shyamalan's movies always seem to do well is establish likable and heart-felt characters, and while the characters in Lady in the Water aren't unlikable they don't possess the kind of depth that one expects. It also doesn't help that Shyamalan also tries make a political statement in the film either. For me, that only takes one out of the story. However, despite my complaints this is still a good film. The story is entertaining with some good scares and characters that are often humorous. Shyamalan's direction is graceful as always and the cast (as well as the FX) isn't half bad.

imdb_lady_in_the_water_escapen2flixtion_20190524,Lady In The Water,IMDb,escapeN2flixtion,2019-05-24,1,The Film That Started Shyamalan's Nosedive,"M. Night Shyamalan was once a promising director. His first few films were so good. Many critics described him as a ""visionary"" and a ""true artist."" But over the years his reputation was sullied to the point where merely speaking his name was enough to repel viewers from the theater. What happened? Well, Lady in the Water happened. Before this film, even Shyamalan's poorer efforts had their share of admirers; after this, he was little more than a joke, and a favorite target for derision amongst critics and audiences. This was the film that derailed the once-great director, and unfortunately, neither his career nor his craft ever fully recovered. The story centers on a water nymph who shows up in an apartment pool one evening, and the tenants' attempts to help her find her way home. The film is supposedly based on bedtime stories that Shyamalan invented for his kids. Nothing wrong with that; I seem to recall the Hobbit was based on stories Tolkien made up for his children. But while the Hobbit turned out to be a well-rounded tale, Lady in the Water is a fractured, unstructured mess. It really feels like Shyamalan is making the story up as he goes. He establishes that the Scrunt, a sort of fairy-wolf monster, is hunting the nymph. But don't worry; he won't attack her now because the Tartutic, three monkey rulekeepers, have forbidden it. But wait! The Scrunt attacks anyway. It turns out the nymph is actually a queen nymph, and queen nymphs are so important that Scrunts WILL break the rules to kill them. So now the nymph needs a whole bunch of new characters to help her - they need to find a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer. When did this ""bedtime story"" become a game of Dungeons & Dragons? These new ""reveals"" about evil monkeys and Symbolists feel tacked on, and don't really justify their own presence. The Healer and Guardian are the only ones who seem to do anything; the others could've been removed. I'm guessing that M. Night's bedtime stories weren't quite deep enough to justify a feature-length movie, so he embellished them by shoving in a bunch of additional details, none of which add any real weight to the flimsy narrative. Maybe this would've worked better as a short story? The film as a whole is too grim. Shyamalan loves slow-burning films with lots of atmosphere, and I do too, but this one is way too dour. Every character seems to be in constant misery. This may be the fault of the actors, none of whom seem to be enjoying themselves. Performances are all-around lackluster. The nymph herself strikes me as a tad haughty; the other tenants risk their lives repeatedly for her sake (one of them even dies), but she rarely seems to give them any consideration in return. You don't really care about any of these characters at any point in the tale. Then there's Shyamalan's character. Talk about self-indulgence. He plays a writer whom the nymph prophesies will be martyred for writing a controversial book that will revolutionize the world. Add to this the character of the film critic, who lives in the complex, wants nothing to do with the nymph, is written to look selfish and unsympathetic, and meets a bizarre and violent death when he is attacked by the Scrunt, and this film really comes across as Shyamalan's whiny attempt to extol himself and demonize his detractors. It's comically ironic to look back on this now: despite casting himself as a revolutionary whose writings would benefit the human race, in real life his writing quality steadily grew worse with each new film. Ha ha. This is one of those movies that really has nothing to offer. The characters are bland, the performances uninspiring, the story unfocused, and the overall experience, in the end, forgettable. Even the CG is bad. Not that Shyamalan's special effects have ever been top-notch: the alien in Signs didn't look that great, but the director at least had the sense to keep the alien mostly hidden in the shadows. Here the Scrunt and the Tartutic are on screen in full glory, and man do they look bad. CG isn't the most important part of a movie, but when it looks THIS unfinished it can absolutely break the immersion. This film was one of the lowest points of Shyamalan's uneven career. While his later movies, like The Happening or Devil, were still bad, they were at least so bad they were funny. Lady in the Water can't even appeal on that level. It's just nothing - an hour-and-a-half-long yawn. Were it not for The Last Airbender, I'd call this the worst thing Shyamalan ever made. Even if you love his other work, you'll get nothing out of this. Watch it only if you'd like to see for yourself what caused Shyamalan to go from cinematic visionary to pariah.

It is here that we meet Heep (played wonderfully as always by Paul Giamatti), the grounds-keeper who silently goes about taking care of the resident's tiny problems. Heep is a man with little to be passionate about, and he therefore devotes himself fully to a job he does not care about. He lives a mundane existence of distant relationships and closeted sadness, until one day a strange being appears in The Cove's swimming pool. One night, as Heep makes his rounds ensuring that no residents are swimming in The Cove's pool after hours, he is saved by a mysterious woman. Her name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and she is a Narf sent from the ""Blue World"" to find her other half in the world of man. As Story explains her reason for living in The Cove's pool, Heep slowly comes to realize that she is a character straight out of a bed-time story, and only with the help of his fellow residents can he bring this bed-time story to its ""Happily Ever After"" ending. While watching the film, the plot is every bit as far-fetched and ridiculous as it sounds. However, a ludicrous plot is not what makes LADY IN THE WATER such a polarizing film. As always, Shyamalan has managed to ground the film with a sense of realism, enabling his audience to suspend their disbelief and go along for the ride. Actually, I found LADY IN THE WATER's story to be its most engrossing element. What does end up hurting the film however are the indulgences Shyamalan allows himself far too freely. Had Shyamalan been satisfied to bring LADY IN THE WATER to the screen with a more peaceful and loving tone, perhaps it would have been better. Unfortunately, he has infused this uplifting story of normal humans finding their purpose with a bitter and defensive tone that only taints its message. It's funny that of all The Cove's eccentric residents, including a man who only works out half of his body and a child who sees messages in cereal boxes, the most deconstructive character to the film is a simple film critic, named Mr. Farber (Bob Balaban). In one scene, after thinking that Mr. Farber holds the key to unlocking the secret behind the Narf, we are told that his opinions never really mattered. The film clearly states that a film critic is nothing more than a man delusional enough to believe that his opinion is all that matters, and clearly no man with such blind arrogance could ever understand the true meaning of the Narf's story. Effectively, Shyamalan seems to be saying that any critic who doesn't like his film clearly lacks the ability to see the film's true meaning. It makes one wonder, if Shyamalan has such undying faith in his creative visions, why is he so confrontational and defensive throughout its presentation? It is this defensive and self-righteous attitude that slowly overtakes the film, dragging it down from what is an intriguing first half. The film continues to suffer as the film finds all too convenient ways to develop its plot. Solutions come all too easily and with little explanation. Perhaps had Shyamalan wisely omitted his obtrusive sub-plot involving Mr. Farber, the solutions could have been reached with more explanation and development. The things that Shyamalan has always excelled at continue to be his film's strongest asset. He casts his films very well, from the leading role played so richly by Paul Giamatti, to the ensemble cast of eccentrics that surround him. Though Bryce Dallas Howard relies too heavily on simply being ""other-worldly"" as opposed to developing a layered character, Shyamalan is able to frame her performance in such a way that it never detracts from the film. My only qualm in the casting is another example of the director's indulgence. Shyamalan has cast himself in a primary role for the first time in one of his films, and though he does a serviceable job, his presence is more of a distraction then anything. It also seems that perhaps the time he spent in front of the camera would have been better spent at home tightening the script or behind the camera giving the film a sweeter tone. Nonetheless, LADY IN THE WATER is a beautifully filmed movie with a distinct visual style and a powerful voice. Though not perfect, it certainly doesn't deserved to be called ""pretentious, paralyzing twaddle"" as Rex Reed so cruelly put it. In this era, it is a wonderful thing to have a director like M. Night Shyamalan even when his movies are not up to par. Whether good or bad, his movies always spark conversation. Even though LADY IN THE WATER will be viewed by many as an enormous disappointment, it is still a valiant (though misguided) attempt and it had this audience member talking all the way out of the theater. Let's just hope that after the dust settles over LADY IN THE WATER, Shyamalan listens to the advice of the film critics he seems to loathe so much and he loses a bit of his arrogance. Whether he does or not, I'll be in line to see what he comes up with next. ... C- ...",890,2,2,True

We get more than a hint of that in the animation sequence during the titles. In fact, the animation sequence reveals most of the plot. Then what is it that Shyamalan is trying to do with the rest of the film, having revealed the plot in first 10 minutes? He is playing a game. Fairy tales are for kids. They are not for adults. What will happen if say I, as an adult, become part of a fairy tale? What if the characters that I had heard of as a child come into being for real? I will probably dismiss the whole situation. But I can't, since the tale has became real now. I'd expect the characters to show off their magic tricks and create fireworks, but that won't happen. When I'm in the middle of it all, the magic and fireworks will hold no charm. They would be mere tools to achieve something of greater importance. All of a sudden, a fairy tale that was so much fun to hear years ago would become dull. When I look at Lady in the Water as an audience, the film evokes in me the same uneasy dullness as it would have if I were a part of it. Shyamalam makes a conscious attempt to strip down all elements of fantasy. He intentionally avoids spectacular special effects. Consider for instance the climax where the Great Eagle carries away Story. For most directors that scene would have been a special effects bonanza moment. Shyamalan just shows us the reflection of the event in the pool. Lady in the Water is a mind game. It engulfs the unassuming audience into the same state as characters of the story. It tells you the sad truth that this is how a fairy tale will look like if it were to be played out for real. And when the tale ends, you will move with your life just as you otherwise will. Lady in the Water does not have the depth you would want it to have like some intellectual interpretation of a fairy tale. At the same time, it is not just as plain as it is made out to look.

Night Shyamalan, the director of this film, started his career off on a high note with The Sixth Sense, which was his first film that anyone can remember. It was clever and everyone loved it. Unfortunately, his follow-up films kept getting progressively worse and worse, although none seemed truly terrible until his career took a real nosedive with Lady in the Water. There are a few of movies I've seen that start with the characters in the film watching a different film or TV program. The action opens on the fictional film-within-a-film, and the audience is momentarily tricked into believing that it's the film they came to watch, as in Blow Out and Sullivan's Travels. It's usually pretty easy to spot, because the film-within-a-film often feels fake. Just as films rarely feel quite like real life, the film-within-a-film rarely feels quite like a real film. In the case of Lady in the Water, I kept waiting for the moment when we realized that we were just watching a fake film that the characters in the real movie were watching. That moment never came. The whole film just felt so strange that I couldn't believe it would be made, marketed, and released as a real movie. I felt betrayed by the director and the theater for taking my money and wasting my time. Lady in the Water is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan wrote for his kids. He should not have made it into a film, but I guess he thought it would be a good idea, so he did. Even after the strange beginning, the movie just keeps getting weirder and weirder, and it's never particularly enjoyable. However, it's never quite as boring as it could be, as the strangeness has its own appeal in a way. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and found myself wondering what nonsense they would throw at us next. How would they outdo themselves in the next scene? Still, it's only appealing—for lack of a better term—for so long, after which it just becomes tiring and nauseating. At one point in the film I decided that my time would be better spent doing something else, so I decided to close my eyes and take a nap. Sleep is very important, you see. I woke up during a scene in which the lead characters decipher secret codes that are hidden in the text and images on the backs of cereal boxes. I thought I was dreaming. I really thought that I must have surely been asleep and dreaming, but I was not. I'd slept through the gradual increase in weirdness and had taken too big of leap all at once. And my brain couldn't handle what my eyes were seeing, so it told me I was dreaming. Lady in the Water is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly one of the worst.

It's ironic, then, that this is the very thing that M Night Shyamalan - hitherto one of the most innovative and imaginative of modern day storytellers - seems to have forgotten in his latest film, ""Lady in the Water,"" the first truly disappointing movie the young writer/director has made to date (and, no, I'm not forgetting ""The Village,"" which I liked much more than most people did). Unlike, say, the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy or the ""Star Wars"" films, in which the filmmakers allow us to see and enter into the fantastical and mythological worlds they've created, in ""Lady in the Water"" the characters spend most of their time DESCRIBING rather than showing us the imaginary world of their story, resulting in a static, talky film that fails to engage the viewer in any truly meaningful way. The wonderful Paul Giamatti stars as Cleveland, the sweet-natured, milquetoast-y manager of a multi-storied apartment building on the outskirts of Philadelphia. One night Cleveland discovers a strange woman swimming in the pool after dark, an intruder he soon discovers to be a sea nymph (called a ""narf"") who has come from the mysterious ""blue world"" to bring a message of hope to mankind. Unfortunately, this creature, who calls herself Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, who played a similar emissary-to-a-strange-world role in ""The Village""), has also inadvertently brought with her a menacing wolf-like monster which threatens to destroy her before she can make it successfully back to her own world. With the help of a number of other, amazingly credulous residents of the complex, Cleveland is able to piece together elements of the mystery in the hope of helping Story to do what she came to do and then return safely home. As with his earlier films, Shyamalan is far more interested in mood and imagery than in easy melodrama and cheap thrills. However, in this case, the film gets so bogged down in explanations and exposition that it winds up talking itself and us to a standstill. The screenplay cheats right off the bat by relying on an outsider's knowledge of the tale to relate the key elements rather than letting those elements reveal themselves naturally and organically. As a consequence, the film is never able to convince us of its authenticity, while the plot points begin to feel increasingly arbitrary and silly the longer the movie drones on. Unfortunately, the film's visual style is every bit as incoherent as the storyline. For some reason, as a director, Shyamalan proves unable to establish or maintain spatial unity in his misc-en-scene. He never gives us a clear view of the entire courtyard, so that we are unable to tell where the woods are in relation to the building or even if the woods are real at all (that would certainly be an intriguing concept, though I honestly don't think that was Shyamalan's intention). For long stretches of the film, we expend our energies trying to orient ourselves in the film's geography, something even the least competent director should be able to do for his audience. At times we seem to be trapped in some type of concrete fortress, while, at other times and from other angles, the setting seems positively bucolic, overrun with thick vegetation and with Cleveland living in what appears to be a quaint little cottage nestled cozily in some nearby woods (but which is somehow supposed to be only a stone's-throw from the apartment's pool). The film looks as if it were shot at two entirely different locales, and that Shyamalan was unable to meld them into anything even remotely approximating a seamless whole. And that seems to be the biggest problem with ""Lady in the Water."" It always feels incompletely formed and half-baked, a thing of bits and pieces rather than a wholly rounded and fully developed work of art.

Somehow, though, it was still wonderful and dreamy, perhaps even more so because there's so much to think about after leaving the theater. Absolutely, it's understood that there is purpose for every human, and that there is no room for power struggles if we plan to work together for the common good, or even for the good of a single being. There is just enough horror without being horrible, and just enough humor without losing the seriousness of the mission. We greatly enjoyed it, never became bored, and were very glad we chose it over the others available tonight.",197,47,34,False

Night Shyamalan out of the gate. In the waning months of the summer of 1999, I was far more impressed with a pre-hype showing of 'Blair Witch Project' than the somewhat predictable debut, 'The Sixth Sense.' Maybe timing is everything. Nonetheless, although 'The Sixth Sense' was hardly a disappointment, I was far, far more impressed with 'Unbreakable,' 'Signs,' and 'The Village.' In my opinion, 'The Sixth Sense' is one of those films that is completely driven by plot, with very little character. These are the types of films that often drive box office revenues and serve the viewer who simply wants to be entertained. But with each of Shyamalan's successive films, fans of 'The Sixth Sense' have become more and more disillusioned with the writer/director. For me and a lot of viewers however, his characters have become richer, and even if the plots have become sloppier and sloppier, at least the works have become more thematic. With 'Lady in the Water', the theme is a significant one - power of storytelling, but the film itself ends up being nothing more than a relatively unaffected exercise in meta-storytelling. Shyamalan can build a wonderful plethora of characters in the first 30 minutes of the film, but he cannot inject them into the mythology he is trying to create in any convincing or meaningful way. Shyamalan has made the grave error of assuming that we will accept this mythology without him doing the hard work as director and writer. Combined with a marked increase in Shyamalan's own screen time (well beyond his signature cameo role), the film drips with hubris of the type of a talented filmmaker who has finally come to believe his own hype. I truly hope that he will come back down to earth for his next film and go back to writing and filming great stories instead of writing and filming stories about stories, neither of which are convincing.",328,2,2,False

Shyamalan's tale, though, isn't nearly that brainy or post-modern. It's a story about fairy tales, myths, the fantastic being very real and having faith in the existence of the supernatural. It's an incredibly earnest faith tale that's even more didactic than ""Signs."" Once again we find Shyamalan inserting the fantastic into the mundane. This time, Shyamalan constructs a very complicated mythology full of narfs, elons, scrunts, and the Tartutic--all invented by the writer, producer, director. As the story proceeds, Shyamalan keeps expanding upon and modifying this mythology. ""Oh wait! Sometimes scrunts will attack narfs, if the narf is a maiden."" This plays like ""The Princess Bride"" without the irony. (Or exactly like Episodes I-III of the Star Wars series.) Your enjoyment of the movie will depend on how much of this you can tolerate. I was refreshed by the movie because of its novelty, the outstanding cast (Paul Giamatti, Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban), and Shyamalan's ambition. I did find it a bit ponderous, though, particularly Bryce Dallas Howard as the narf. She is so pure, so virginal, and very boring. She is merely a device, but is on screen for about 2/3rds of the movie. (SPOILERS)The larger point of the movie, though, seems to be that M. Night Shyamalan is a brave visionary whose work angers some, but is of the utmost importance to mankind. The narf--water nymph--is discovered in the pool of The Cove apartment complex by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the super. He discovers that many of the residents of The Cove have a role to play in helping to complete the narf's mission. The mission of the narf, ultimately, is to inspire actor/director/writer M. Night Shyamalan, playing struggling writer Vick Ran, to complete his master work. He learns that his work will change mankind for the better, but will make him a martyr. This will either anger you, or you will be able to look past it, but it ultimately makes the movie about massaging the director's ego.(SPOILERS END) An interesting misfire that I look forward to seeing again.

Night Shyamalan at his worst: a director seemingly incapable of pacing and tone. This one's from the heart, an original fairy story told to one of his kids and adapted into an adult movie. While I admire Shyamalan's intentions, the result is an inexcusably bad film, one made all the more frustrating that it starts out kind of good. The first hour or so was mildly entertaining, boasting an excellent and rare leading performance from Paul Giamatti (who holds everything together) as a handyman who discovers a nymph floating in his apartment block's swimming pool. So far so unusual, but around the hour mark the film totally falls apart. Shyamalan was fine at setting up his premise, but he has no idea what to do with it once he gets there, and as a result the movie just kind of plods along until an entirely forgettable ending. Aside from Giamatti, along with brief turns from Jeffrey Wright and Freddy Rodriguez, the cast is disappointing. Shyamalan himself has a supporting role and is no actor, so it's kind of embarrassing to have him casting himself in this when somebody decent could have taken the part. The real-world interaction isn't bad, but the fairy tale type stuff that goes on is embarrassingly twee and underwritten, with ridiculous names for characters and creatures. You get the idea that Shyamalan thought he was really good for thinking this stuff up, but the truth is it's been done a hundred times better before and this turns out to be his worst film yet.",267,9,7,False

Allegedly writer/director M Night Shyamalan had a major fall out with the studio when one of the studio heads decided to take her daughters to a birthday party rather than spend the night reading the screenplay to this film . It's also a film that bombed on its release and received universally bad reviews so I was in no rush to see it at all . After seeing it I have to agree with the majority view Some people have criticised Shymalan's movie cameos as being egotistical but with LADY IN THE WATER he's pulled out all the stops to make himself the centre of the universe . Allegedly the film is based upon a story he used as a bed time story for his children , he casts himself as Vick Ran an author whose writings will change the world . On top of that he introduces a character called Harry Farber who is effectively the movie's human villain that every one hates . And what does this villain do for a living ? That's right he's a film critic . If he wanted to be really obvious I suppose Shymalan could have called the critic Harry Knowles but everything is obvious enough - Shymalan is the king of the world while critics are bad people There's very little substance to the film , maintenance man Cleveland Heap finds a strange girl called Story in the communal swimming pool only to find she comes from another place and creatures will pursue her . I guess at this point everyone who sees the film is supposed to fall to their knees in awe that Shymalan has invented a new concept called "" Meta-fiction "" but an audience is more likely to throw popcorn at the screen than bow . Not only that but the narrative moves at a snail's pace and despite several startle moments involving loud noises there's no tension and you'll be completely puzzled if this is trying to be a supernatural fantasy or not . There's little drama , atmosphere or frights to be had I have to admit I have enjoyed this writer/director's work in the past . UNBREAKABLE remains an underrated masterpiece in my opinion and while there were several flaws to the screenplay to SIGNS it still remains a highly atmosphericmmovie .

It is a very well-crafted film, but that doesn't make it a great film, just a good film, but not good enough to shell out the type of money they charge at movie theaters. First, let me say that this is not a obvious, hit you on the head type of movie. And it has a quiet way about it, but the problem with this film is that it feels like there is something missing. You are watching it and you want the film to take off a bit more than it does. M. Night likes subtleness. What I mean is he likes the hint of things that ""could"" be possible. He uses the hint of the supernatural in The Sixth Sense. In Unbreakable, its the hint of possible you could be more just your mundane self. With Signs the obvious hint is aliens. And in the Village, you get a hint of perception and things people do to drastically change their lives. With all those previous movies, there is always a possibility of being true and things that has been discuss amongst people for years (is it true, or isn't it, no definitive answer). In this film, however, the subject matter isn't believable. He doesn't sell it very well. The audience really have to take a giant leap, but that leap doesn't make sense. Don't get me wrong, it was still interesting and the performance by Paul Giamata is outstanding. I think him being exposed in a more accessible film like this (instead of the indie flicks), and having to carry the picture, will get him noticed by mainstream audience. He is, after all, has to carry the whole picture. It has some good humor in it, but overall, its doesn't make sense. So in summation, if you take this film, as a fairy tale, then yeah, it's cool. But it's not very exciting. It's like Signs meets The Village. Still, its a lot better than the other stuff thats out. This is a rental and is probably best watching the film at home.

The movie opens with a sequence of black and white tribal drawings telling a story that seems to lead no where. Then, a slow-moving beginning attempts to build up, only to fall down-hill. Story, (""the lady in the water""), gives almost no direction to the stuttering super who finds her in the first place, yet, expects him to help her. The story changes so many times and moves so slow it becomes very hard to follow, and, with so many sub-plots you're not sure what to hope for.

imdb_lady_in_the_water_fernandoschiavi_20211126,Lady In The Water,IMDb,fernandoschiavi,2021-11-26,6,NULL,"Not a horror film, a bedtime story with not easily appeal to everyone, and there is no shortage of metaphors about the human condition, politics, religion, etc First of all, it is necessary to clarify that The Lady in the Water is NOT a horror movie. Not that the production was being ""sold"" to the public as being of the horror genre, because since the first trailers started airing, the plot has been presented as ""a bedtime story"" and that's how the film will be treated, with its hits and misses. It's different from most of the director's films, and it certainly won't appeal to those who limit themselves to evaluating his work against ""The Sixth Sense"", as if he had a unique style. At first glance, the film seems to have a bizarre story, with a superficial script that goes around and around and seems to just swindle the viewer. However, the most rigorous analysts will certainly identify the infinite subliminal contexts, filled with different symbologies and connotations - such as religion, politics, and, of course, fantasy. Paradoxically, there is a doubt whether such symbologies were really the director's intention, but even so, he manages to maintain an atmosphere of electrifying mystery, redeeming himself from the defects of the previous film, ""A Vila"". The first observation that should be made is that The Lady in the Water is not a film for everyone, as the production follows a hybrid path between fantasy and suspense, which may no longer please those who are used to the previous works of the Indian, more focused on a strong suspense. Shyamalan's initial proposal was to make a film that was really like ""a bedtime story"" and within that theme, he sought to work with a more implicit fear within a narrative that follows a fanciful path. The film also subliminally addresses themes such as good and evil, truth and lies, sin and redemption, among others, which provide the spice for the union between fable and mystery. The story even seems banal at a certain point, however, it gradually gains more weight, so that what seemed obvious to the spectator becomes an immense and complex game that leaves us attentive and stuck in the armchair every second. Quite creative the way this ""bedtime story"" unfolds, even getting confused most of the time. And, fortunately, most of the time, the director left the fear only induced - unlike in ""The Village"" and ""Signs"", in which the monsters were still shown with a good amount of film running -, leaving it to the spectator build such fear in one's own head, reinforcing it with only a few periodic scares through lightning appearances of the much-feared creatures of the film. Another important factor is linked to the fact that Shyamalan has always carried out works that deal with the human being as the central theme of his stories, although other elements, such as suspense, end up overlapping this proposal. As examples, it is enough to go back in time to realize that The Sixth Sense works with the issue of acceptance, whether it is death or the paranormal. Sinais (2002) approaches the drama of a father and his connection with his children, while A Vila criticizes the collective lie and the fact that ignorance is considered by some as a blessing. The director continues to work this human being in The Lady in the Water, introducing a main character, Cleveland, who has an unfinished past that prevents him from being happy. The narf itself will be a kind of reconciling agent for the film's human elements, who become better people after having contact with the girl. In fact, this point is one of the highlights of the plot for generating sequences that work with this emotional side of the character without seeming corny and managing to reach the public. It is curious to note similarities between The Lady in the Water and The Village. Given their proper proportions, the two works take place in an enclosed space, alien to the outside world. All the action takes place in a limited space, almost as if the world only existed in that special place with so many different and interconnected people. The plot of The Lady in the Water begins in a pleasant way, developing a story capable of arousing the public's attention. In this principle, we are introduced to the locals, get to know the Cleveland routine and follow the emergence of Story. In this first part, the director avoids clichéd moments and builds his fairy tale efficiently. However, it will be during this journey that Shyamalan will, unfortunately, lose control of the situation and what could make a great movie, results only in trivial work. It will be midway through the plot that the director will be in doubt about the path he should follow to complete his work, which from then on becomes too adult to sound like a fairy tale while showing himself too much children to interest the grown-up audience. Such criticism is noticeable at various times, such as when the film begins to work with the skills of the chosen people to help Story return to their world, when everything sounds too comical and too improbable, even within a fable. One of the most absurd moments is when residents discover that there is a boy who can read subliminal messages from cereal boxes. Can you imagine the confusion in this kid's head when he's in the supermarket in the section for that product? At the same time, there is a dangerous creature, which appears around the condominium to put an end to poor Story. Such a villain does not work within the plot and ends up being one more digital monster like so many others already seen. Indefinite, the production follows this hybrid path to the predictable end without further development. Another point that hinders a greater interest in the action is the secondary characters. Although the main two, Cleveland and Story, are quite interesting (helped by the great presence of Giamatti and the beautiful Bryce Dallas Howard), the rest of the condominium residents are stereotyped and do away with any possibility of a good review for the plot. Among the inhabitants of the building there is a young man who does weight training with only one side of his body, an elderly Chinese woman who does the scandalous old line who does not speak English, a Latino couple with five daughters and so on. Also in terms of characters, there are two others that are, above all, poorly conceived. The first is a guy named Vick, played by Shyamalan himself and who, for some strange reason, stands out among the other supporting cast. Another character that could have been left out of the plot is the film critic who is one of the residents of the condominium. With boring behavior and always talking about how film productions are predictable, weak and bad, Shyamalan's idea would be to make a reference to the demand of professionals who write about films and who do not always please filmmakers. Because this critic doesn't add anything to the story, his participation is unnecessary and the end of it is more like the director's hack as if he wanted to say to the cinema audience: look how funny I am. Despite being a good movie, the movie does have its flaws. Unfortunately, the director falls into his own trap and falters in the final moments when exposing certain creatures that were already built in the viewer's heads, leaving a feeling of disappointment. There are also some serious script errors, such as the so easy acceptance of the apartment's residents to collaborate with Cleveland and help him protect the mysterious girl from the fantasy world. All right, Shyamalan wanted the childlike spirit to be reborn in everyone, but let's face it, it's hard to swallow that everyone immediately believes that a girl came from a fantasy world and they all play an important role in her salvation. Still, the process of getting to know Cleveland about this ""bedtime story"" presents itself somewhat drawn out, making it difficult not to get tired of the various explanations - grudgingly - of the old oriental woman, and the fact that narf cannot talk about her world it becomes extremely far-fetched. But, nothing that spoils the final result. The most curious thing is to think that such negative points, such as the indecision that the film goes through from its half, an extremely obvious ending, having to put up with Shyamalan as an actor, and other small slips, could have been removed, as the story in itself is interesting. The good intention of this work is made by a man who knows he has the power to take any story and turn it into a film, even a bedtime. ""The Lady in the Water"" is the kind of quirky film, which will certainly not easily appeal to everyone (including ardent critics), whether because of the fanciful theme, the seemingly monotonous plot development, or simply the sheer pet peeve of the filmmaker, who even as far as I know, he never wrote any contract saying that his films would have to go in the style of ""The Sixth Sense"". ""The Lady in the Water"" is a work that consolidates the spectacular direction of M. Night Shyamalan, who still knows how to make a good suspense like no one else. Analyzed with intelligence and a much deeper vision of what is simply in front of our eyes, it is a full plate for those who appreciate symbologies applied to script details. And there is no shortage of metaphors about the human condition, politics, religion, etc. Detail that the ending even seems to be from some art film, trying not to ""chew up"" all the events that took place during the projection, leaving to the spectator such countless reflections, after the credits rise.",1658,1,1,False

Night Shyamalan, might just be his most original and most entertaining movie. There were so many things that were extremely likable. One great feature was the great array of characters. i have never laughed so much in a suspense movie because of characters. the level of suspense, or lack there of, is also a bonus of this movie. When Night wants to scare you, he will with his trademark creepiness and his jump moments. But many people have forgotten that this is a fairy tale, and when Night wants to be in awe of the original story, and trust him on its many twists and turns, he will make those moments very charming. There are many shots of the Lady, and sometimes she may just be standing there, but there is something very storybook-esque, that keeps your eyes riveted to the screen. The moral to this story is a very true one too. Finding your purpose on earth, and using the powers that were given to you to make everything better in life. There have been many movies that are shown during the summer season, but Lady stands out a a small fairytale that will charm you to the credits, and will have you thinking about it after the lights in the theater come up.",224,19,12,False

It's really a strange, simplistic name until you take it in the context of the movie. M. Night Shyamalan remains one of the best story tellers of our time.

Someone should tell MNS, that you can't create a fairy tale from scratch. In this movie he went all the way with fantasy. His earlier movies had just some amount of super-natural stuff, but this movie had just some amount of realism. Too many real characters, too many fantasy characters, lack of suspense and thrills. The story is something that you can think of as well, if you wanted to create a bed-time story. Just think random, put some good , put some evil, put some more good to protect the good and put your thoughts together just to give a happy ending, and there you have it -your own ""Lady in the Water"". When I go to tell this story to my friends, I am over within a minute, since there really is no story as well.

Night's previous work then you are probably going to enjoy this film. However, if you are familiar with the over-rated auteur then you will probably be mildly disappointed by ""Lady in the Water"". Based on a Fairytale contrived by M. Night himself, but alleges that it is based on Asian folklore, which in itself is unoriginal as we are more than used to American Cinema ripping off Asian horror in all its forms. M Night might have been trying to make a political statement here about American Cinema but I doubt it as it wouldn't gel well with the rest of the picture. I have to say that I am familiar with his work and therefore I was slightly disappointed. Unfortunately, to begin with, the film isn't as original as some would have you believe and has been influenced by other films most notably Neil Jordan's ""The Company of Wolves"" (which is a much better take on the fairytale genre, and scarier  probably because it was made in a day when film-making wasn't so compromised in favour of the Studio's required audience age). ""Lady in the Water"" tries too hard to complicate the genre by fulfilling the unnecessary need to re-invent itself. Folklore, legend, myths etc are what they are because of the time and generations they have taken to evolve and it is a very difficult task to try and construct your own in 90mins. The Lady in the Water fairytale has no substance or back-up; it cannot relate itself to anything that an audience could familiarise with - only that we all have a purpose which is a common theme in any story. The drawing together of the people in the apartment building reminded me of ""Batteries Not Included"", a far more enjoyable family piece about people joining together whilst sharing a single goal. I also don't believe the film to be as well constructed as his previous efforts with a superfluous use of extended pull-focus shots towards the beginning of the film that served no narrative purpose; furthermore the manner in which the sound was employed throughout was poor as the whispering was too gratuitous and therefore hampered the plot too much as it was felt everything that was a said was a 'secret' that has to be understood, and heard, in order to understand the films direction. Ultimately, and because of M. Night's desire to tell a bran-new fairytale, the film has a plot that only an adult would understand and the visuals that only a child would enjoy.

imdb_lady_in_the_water_wheresirenssleep49_20110227,Lady In The Water,IMDb,wheresirenssleep49,2011-02-27,10,Imagination is more powerful than knowledge.,"If you don't understand this film or what it is about or think it's illogical, let me explain.. This film is about finding wonder and magick in the ordinary. It is also about ""purpose"". Obviously, being able to find wonder in the ordinary is a source of purpose and hope. It is what makes a child innocent, pure, and childlike and what makes a person feel alive. There are hints all throughout the movie that clearly explain so many of it's meanings.. why it confused people I have no idea. Even the part where the Asian girl tells Heep he has to act innocent and like a child to win the trust of her mother so that her mother will tell him the story is a hint. Reading prophecy from the cereal boxes was not absurd either. Again, it was about finding wonder and the unordinary in the ordinary.. about the power of the imagination to heal and to create. In most fantasy movies mages use crystal balls to scry prophecy and the future, but who says children cannot use cereal boxes? Both are just tools that set the imagination free. Really, it doesn't matter what tool you use. That's why it doesn't matter this is taking place in an apartment building in the most unlikely of places to the most unlikely people. And why do they believe? She obviously has magnetic power over them. The writer only needed to be introduced to her for her to stimulate her ""awakening"" in him. That was all. Then she was ready to go home. They didn't even have to talk. Heep's stuttering mysteriously stopped anytime he was simply in her presence. Yes, she seemed ordinary, but she clearly wasn't. Why is it so hard to imagine this effect would not spread to the other residents? Water faeries, in case you do not know, are known for their magnetic, irresistible power to seduce. Have you never heard of the evil sirens that lure sailors to their deaths with sweet songs? This film could be about many things of course and everything is subjective, but these are just a few of the meanings I saw in it. This film seemed a touch inspired by the classic Neverending Story by Michael Ende. I am very curious if Night is familiar with Ende's work. Certainly, Indians are more spiritual and their religious literature is littered with talk of nymphs, fae, and spirit beings of all kinds so they are more spiritually minded and open I guess than most westerners. His Indian background is becoming very evident to me the more of his movies I see. Night Shyamalan is good and he does not at all deserve all the hatred he is getting. So many worse movies come out constantly and even if you think these movies aren't like Sixth Sense or don't understand them, they're still more imaginative and creative than most the drivel that comes out of Hollywood. You could hardly honestly call any of his movies bad in comparison to most others, so why is everyone picking on him? Because you think he's egotistical for starring in his own movies? xD What about you for acting like such a know it all and getting so offended by that? That's not just a tad bit egotistical? As if all these critics complaining and attacking him do not have egos. xD I do think he's simply creating unique art more these days and using his artistic license because true artists desire to experiment and not submit to convention, but that's where the critics always try to come in and destroy someone's creative spirit and act like they know it all when what do they really ever know? Their opinions are no better than anyone else's and everyone sees something different when they look at something. Perception is subjective and it always will be. You can't put walls and chains around the act of creation as so many try to do. So many have lost their true purpose, are only acting out a caricature of what they think others want them to be, and this is why.. the critic is more than the destroyer of stories.. he is the destroyer of dreams. I doubt most caught on to the even deeper meaning of the critic character in this movie.. he could represent not only the authoritarian literary and film critic, but the jaded cynical scientific and tyrannical materialist.. the jaded cynical pessimist.. the cynical dogmatist that comes in all shapes and sizes.. In killing the critic of the story, MSN was restoring hope and wonder to what has become the lifeless and mundane and hopeless world of mankind. Ponder that. He is the messiah of his own story, and I see nothing wrong or egotistical in that. We are all Gods of our own stories. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so is art. This movie takes a bit of imagination to enjoy. Set your imagination free, the way children tend to do, and maybe you'll see it clearly. Then maybe after watching it you'll be rewarded with that childlike sense of wonder again for a moment that has become such a fleeting feeling in your stale and corrupted cynical adult life. Movies like this don't come along often. MNS is deep. Way too deep for most to understand apparently. People think he's insulting their intelligence when actually he's trying not to. :-/ But you know it's a bad argument when someone has to resort to character attacks and accusations that a person is ""egotistical"" to try to prove their point. Thank you M. Night, for being true to your art and not selling out for the sake of pleasing others.

If it weren't for the fact that I had driven a friend to the theater and had met others there for the sneak preview also, I would have left in the middle of it. And I never leave in the middle of a movie. Within the first half hour, the characters were already getting on my last nerve. The basic premise somewhat interested me, but the stupid characters coupled with an obvious attempt to solicit laughs based on a few ridiculously exaggerated situations and the main character's stutter throughout the movie really clinched it for me. And no, I'm neither a critic nor a fan of Shyamalan. I judge each movie on its own merit and don't give a damn about whose name is on it. I loved Sixth Sense. Unbreakable wasn't exactly my type of movie, but I found it entertaining and wouldn't take issue with it because of the genre. I really didn't care for Signs at all, but I didn't completely detest it. But I really hated this movie. I kept hoping that some bizarre twist would at least give the movie some redeeming quality in my eyes, but almost every turn they took was completely predictable. And the few things that were a bit of a surprise didn't help because they just seemed to me like an obvious attempt at being ""cutesy"". Oh well, I know there will be people out there who like the movie. I did hear a few people laughing at the stupid attempts at humor. Although, by the end of the movie, I was fairly convinced that people just wanted to laugh in order to avoid the awkward situation of silence when laughter is almost expected. It reminded me of when a lousy comedian takes the stage and you get a few people laughing at things that are completely not funny just because it seems to be the thing to do. At any rate, those are my thoughts on the movie. I have never written a review at this site before because nothing has ever moved me to do so like this dud. In fact, I hadn't even registered at the site even though I have visited it regularly for years. I've been kind of curious to read some threads, but was too lazy to take the few minutes to register in order to do so.

By typical, I don't necessarily imply tired or clichéd or annoying. Yes, expect all these ingredients plus the multi-layered narrative that Manoj always has in his films. While in no way does this surpass his period drama ""The Village"", it is very entertaining, where one can experience more humor - and please don't run, also more screen time for writer-director Manoj who doesn't cameo but actually appears as a co-STAR, a writer and one of the integral characters to the plot. Newton Howard's scoring is less effusive and melancholic than in The Village, - his previous collaboration with Shyamalan, but it is nonetheless still enchanting, uplifting and suited to the genre and nuances of LADY IN THE WATER. The acting is nothing short of superb, Giamatti and Howard portray the emotions with the appropriate intensity called for. Yes, there are no big reveals in ""Lady"" but expect a lot of twists - little twists in this one that are very well foreshadowed in the many parts that Night tells his story softly and gently. As he said once, you might want to lean in to absorb the subtleties and essential plot elements carried out as exposition in the dialogue. I especially loved the twist involving the arrogant critic, it was foreshadowed NOT earlier, but contained within the scene of his evident and inevitable demise. There is a lot of grim humor and tense laughter that ""Lady"" does inspire, a trick that Shyamalan has mastered ever since ""SIGNS"" in 2002. Amazing, visually stimulating and fiendish cinematographical acrobatics are to be expected from the way Night uses his camera in Lady in the Water. The usual Shyamalan trademark reflection shots are around - and try watching that washing machine close-up sequence and see if it doesn't raise your hair. Manoj excels in framing his story for the cinema screen, and in addition you will also be treated to wickedly ""claustrophobic angles"" that but enhance the tension, and some ""objective"" camera moves that put the audience with more superior knowledge than the movie's characters - evermore adding up to the suspense in the movie's key fright moments. Coupled with these exhilarating scares are moments of drama, in which Manoj may have succeeded in putting the right amount moments that could elicit tears or even emotional response from the audience. A woman behind me in the cinema would have wanted more defined denouement as the movie concludes, but evidently those who want everything concise may rejoice as Shyamalan, as also the writer himself takes us out of there when the main plot, or core of the story has been resolved. I especially LOVED one of the last shots from under the pool, the event of which it depicts I will NOT divulge as you have to see it. It is extremely sentimental, heartbreaking and bittersweet, that and the rest of the ending. You will see a lot of thrills and showdown as the movie prepares itself to close, and James Newton Howard's music as usual combines the ominous melodies with the uplifting cues, the score gracefully flexing it's muscle to accentuate the spellbinding tale of Shyamalan.

The filmmaker must be able to suspend the disbelief of the moviegoers, even the skeptical ones, and pull them into a universe where fate exists explicitly, and each character has purpose and meaning. In M. Night Shayamalan's Lady in the Water, ""destiny"" holds true. If you have seen other works of Shayamalan's, you will recognize it as a common theme in his films, most notably within ""Signs."" While not a fan of ""Signs"" myself, I enjoyed ""Lady in the Water."" I felt a small tingle at the base of my neck as I waited for each piece of the puzzle to come together, wondering to myself ""who will this person turn out to be?"" The time spent discovering each character does make the movie drag a bit, but while some critics have complained that this is filler for too simple a plot line, I feel that the combination of the lives and personalities of these characters are what gives the movie it's heart. Paul Giamatti's performance is subtle but beautiful to behold. It is often said that this actor does not get the recognition he deserves, but I hope that viewers will be able to appreciate his skill with this role. He is able to present a broken man that slowly begins to build within himself, as well as the audience, that small events and small people can offer hope for the future. Bryce Dallas Howard also shines as a catalyst for that change, pulling the colorful characters of a small apartment community together in their efforts to aid her. If whimsy isn't your cup of tea, then maybe this movie isn't for you. Like any fairytale, there are archetypes that fall just a bit too smoothly into their roles, and there are always a few loose ends left lying around.

M.Night Shyamalan is seriously beginning to run out of fresh ideas to hang his hokey 'one trick pony' killer twists on. The plot centres around a mild-mannered janitor, Cleveland, who discovers Story, the eponymous lady, one evening. During the course of the film, Cleveland discovers that Story is a very special person, who has an important mission to fulfill, but is in danger. As the film progresses, Cleveland and the other tenants of the apartment block discover that they have roles to play in Story's...errm....story. Anyhoo...without giving away too many spoilers, the full tale is told (painfully slowly), and becomes so implausible that it snaps the oh-so-important element of suspension of belief, repeatedly! Firstly, there are the stupid names. Secondly, a whole apartment block of fairly diverse characters are ready to completely and unquestioningly drop their rationale and start believing in this far fetched tale, which includes giant eagles, grass rats and invisible evil tree-monkeys. Sure! Okay! It's a film after all, and let's face it, there are films which have crazier plot-lines. The problem is that the mundane and the fantastic does not gel here. (In fact, it never seems to gel in any M.Night Shyamalan film anymore). People are quite happy to just go along with the whole thing without ever questioning their reasoning or their sanity. Thirdly, the acting is just god-awful. I'm pretty sure that an actor doesn't need much motivation to play a part where the role is to just play an apartment tenant, but 90% of the cast even struggle with that! I will give props, however, to the actress who played the oriental student living with her mother, and to the guy who had to train up one side of his body, not because his acting was much cop (it wasn't), but for actually training part of his body for the role. Fourthly, there really were no outstanding moments throughout the whole film. No ""Oh no!""s, or ""YESS!"" moments that had you rooting for the characters. Even the scene where Cleveland descends into the pool was about as thrilling as the opening scene where he is squishing a bug in a flat full of squeamish sisters. Even the ending is all very anti-climatic. It just...ends (which is a small mercy, but after having to put up with the agonizing nonsense that makes up the bulk of the film, the payoff is pretty dismal. Fifthly (are we on five already??!!?), what the hell was the point with the movie critic? Was it supposed to be some sort of inner joke, or a challenge to the audience (at one point) to try to second-guess the outcome, or a metaphor for a separation of what is real and what is just a movie? Whatever Shyamalan had in mind, it didn't work. In fact, it riled me considerably. There are sixthlys, seventhly's, and even a sixteently, but I don't want to start giving away spoilers for anyone who might actually watch this film, and I'm getting a bit fed up with writing so much on this film already, when there are better efforts in a similar vein from any number of other directors. Having said all that, the film wasn't a total loss. There were a few redeeming moments, and I suppose it had a moral (something about how our actions influence others, or how you should never give up on your inner child or some-such), and my best compliment on the whole film is ""At least it wasn't as pitifully bad as the Village"", however, I personally think that the film is a Razzy contender for sure, and Shyamalan should consider taking up poultry farming. He seems to have a knack in producing some big old turkeys! ADDITIONAL EDIT: I initially gave the movie 3 stars. After seeing that Shyamalan chose to give himeslf an important and messianical role in his own film, I was appalled enough to come back and edit this critique. The sheer AUDACITY of the guy! There is nothing wrong with an ego that deserves praise, but this very act of Shyamalan implementing himself in the role of a writer who will change the course of history is mental narcissism to a sickening degree. I hope that Shyamalan NEVER makes another film ever again, no matter how good he thinks he is, he has lost touch with the very people he is supposed to be making these films for, and creating castles in the sky based on nothing more than hype and the success of one single film. He should have listened to Disney. They may be commercial, but they at least know how to make popular & successful films.",804,6,4,False

(most of these people will be bitter through the first 30 minutes over the fact that it is not a horror film and simply give up on the story's strange, unusual twists) See, this movie paints a message in big friendly fluffy letters: Although we are not told our purpose in life, we mean much, much more than we often give ourselves credit for. I almost got in the boat of bitter viewers after a while, but as the story became more complex, I began to trust where the film was taking me. Fortunately, this trust paid off. I have not felt like this since seeing the first Neverending Story! I was just a child back then. This one brought me way back. To any potential viewer: This is a fantastic fairytale that if followed carefully will make you think very deeply of who we are as one, and what you individually mean to this world. Also, it should be a feature of choice for the younger ones. It allows to dream, while keeping touch with reality.

I loved Sixth Sense, I thought Unbreakable was just as genius, thoroughly enjoyed the Village, and thought Signs was pretty decent though a couple things could have been done differently. I think M. Night Shymalan is a very skilled director and a creative story teller...and is probably most known for the huge twists at the end of his films as he shows you everything that you missed that was right in front of you. I understand its not the ending that makes the film, but ""Lady in the Water""'s ending was a bit absurd. The giant grass dogs (creative and creepy creatures, in my opinion) are attacked by -and I kid you not- giant monkeys that look exactly like a cross between the alien in Signs and the 'creatures' from the Village. And their attack makes NO sense. Even keeping in the mindset that this is a bed time story and completely fantasy, the film still has a weak plot. ""Story"", the narf (which is the word Pinky from ""Pinky and the Brain"" would always say so I couldn't take it seriously), needs to come up from the water to tell a writer his future and importance in writing a book that will change mankind, but she can't go back into the water without Tatsuis (grass dogs) attacking her before the giant eagle comes because she is the queen narf. or something. So she needs the help of Cleavland (the groundskeeper with a secret past) who is either the guardian, healer, or guildsman, or symbol reader. The plot couldn't be saved even though Paul Giamatti was absolutely fantastic and, in fact most of the actors and actresses did a great job (though i prefer Shyamalan as a cameo rather than the major role he had), the camera angles and cinematography were so inventive and what you've come to expect from a Shymalan movie. In the end, its not that this is the worst film I have ever seen, or even that it is a terrible movie. The film is just disappointing and pretty much forgettable. The moral ""everyone has a purpose and everything has a reason"" has been done before in Signs, and actually basically every other Shymalan movie. I still love him, but he needs to stick to directing until he can write up a more original screen play for next time.",407,1,1,True
imdb_lady_in_the_water_boba_fett1138_20100713,Lady In The Water,IMDb,Boba_Fett1138,2010-07-13,4,Just plain bad and silly.,"Never expected this movie to be good but I certainly did also not expected it to be as bad as it turned out to be. Guess somewhere deep inside of it the movie had some potential and some original ideas but the movie just doesn't ever do something good or interesting with it. It's not really an entertaining movie, not a tense one at all and not mysterious enough or fantasy like. It basically feels like a quite pointless movie to watch, that is a lot but is also nothing at the same time. With ""Unbreakable"" M. Night Shyamalan delivered a realistic super-hero movie. With ""Signs"" he delivered a realistic science-fiction movie (till the last minutes at least). With this movie he tried to deliver a realistic fairy-tale. His approach totally failed though, which is not only due to his misplaced directing approach but also really due to its story, which he also wrote on his own by the way. Sorry, just nothing really makes sense in this movie. I can go along with some imaginative storytelling, with strange worlds and magical characters but this movie is just lacking in all and it's story is just plain silly. No one seems to think its strange and unlikely at all that a water nymph suddenly appears and everybody decides to help out, without asking any questions. It's obviously that M. Night Shyamalan tried to put all kinds of deeper meanings to the story and characters in it, about believing in stories and making your own and everyone and everything has a purpose in life but absolutely nothing about it works out. It instead makes the movie more silly and also certainly slower. Just can't really think of a right audience that might end up liking this movie. The movie was probably intended as magical and maybe even uplifting but M. Night Shyamalan ruined all of his, potentially good, own ideas. Due to its directing approach the movie also visually was a disappointing one. The movie tries to be less Hollywood like and more independent like. Sounds like a good idea but it makes this a very self indulgent one that is all too aware of itself and of the different style it tries to create. This is most apparent in the distracting cinematography with some annoying and above all pointless camera-angels, that really take you out of the movie. The special effects were also really disappointingly bad. Simply not acceptable for 2006 movie standards, especially not when you have such an high budget to work with, as this movie had. Paul Giamatti is a good actor and while he also is still good in this, I just think that he is one of those actors that is always better off playing the secondary character. I don't know, he just isn't that interesting as a main lead, which might also be really due to his looks. M. Night Shyamalan obviously tried to make a star out of Bryce Dallas Howard, after already have cast her in his previous movie ""The Village"" but he instead almost single handedly ruined it, by making her character extremely boring and give her absolutely nothing interesting to do. A positive note on its casting; I did like Jeffrey Wright and Bob Balaban in this. M. Night Shyamalan also once more gave himself an acting role in this movie, with a big difference this time that it is quite a large role. And no, he just isn't much good in it. Don't know what is worse; M. Night Shyamalan acting, writing or directing for this movie. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",600,6,4,False

I knew early on that I was going to be asked to suspend disbelief big time, and I willingly went along with that expectation because Night's movies have a lot of soul to them. It's worth making the necessary sacrifices to enjoy his payoffs. But in the end I was disappointed. After 2/3 of the show was over I was ready to rewarded. Instead of a smooth transition from magic to a new reality promised by the build-up, suddenly things go awry and new characters are brought in, ones whom we don't necessarily care about. The trouble is, I felt that I really could care about these people but I couldn't because I didn't know enough about them--and I really wanted to. With a little better plotting I think this could have been a great movie. A prime example of how I felt let down was when the little boy is able to decipher major clues to the mystery from the sides of cereal boxes. But we're not shown how he does this. It made me think of the scene in Spielberg's ""E.T."" where the kids and alien are able to construct a way to phone home using junk found around the house--and we actually see how they do it. This scene would have been much more fascinating and believable if we had actually been shown what the boy was seeing on the boxes and why it was helping him derive the clues. Instead, we have to take his word for it--which is not much fun. The movie is worth it in that it does contain some nice dialogue about our place in the world and how to discover it. But in the end, I think Night should have taken some cues from his ill-fated movie critic character and paid more attention to his audience's wants, needs, and expectations.",323,1,1,True
imdb_lady_in_the_water_kylopod_20070905,Lady In The Water,IMDb,kylopod,2007-09-05,3,A good Giamatti performance can't save a flat and convoluted story,"Shyamalan has had his ups and downs as a filmmaker, but all his previous films have been dependable in at least one sense: no matter how confusing they became, they always ended up revolving around a simple idea. ""Lady in the Water"" breaks that pattern, featuring a convoluted story that piles one arbitrary development upon another until finally losing any semblance of a coherent structure. The premise involves a youthful sea nymph who becomes trapped in the human world and must make her way back to her realm (which the film unwisely calls ""the Blue World""), avoiding a wolf-like creature that stands in her path. She falls into the life of a lonely middle-aged superintendent (Paul Giamatti) by appearing one night in his swimming pool, stark naked. Any disturbing sexual overtones are kept in the background. This is a bedtime story, after all. She is a ""narf,"" the wolf-thing is a ""scrunt,"" and she must wait for an eagle called the ""Great Eatlon"" before she can return home. Each of the apartment tenants has a specific role to play in the process. If any of this sounds bewildering, the movie does little to clear up the confusion. The film's rather forced attempts at allegory--such as naming the sea nymph ""Story""--only further prevent this magical world from coming alive. It's just a tangle of exotic names and arbitrary rules. Giamatti learns most of these details from an Asian woman who, due to some unexplained connection, knows a fairy tale describing Story's predicament. The woman speaks no English, however, and can communicate with Giamatti only through her daughter. This contrived plot device serves one purpose only, and that is to keep Giamatti from learning the necessary details all at once. Ever since Shyamalan's film ""The Sixth Sense"" came out, I've heard occasional detractors complain that they figured out the main plot secret early on. My response is, well, good for you. That only shows that the secret was well-planted. (Or that these people are good liars who don't want to admit they were fooled.) Good plot twists always rest on sound logic, giving the audience an opportunity to anticipate them even if they are cleverly concealed. ""Lady in the Water"" is unpredictable in a bad way, surprising us without rhyme or reason--and that's ironic considering the movie's message about there being a purpose in everything. Shyamalan is a religious man. He believes strongly that the universe is not random, and he uses this belief as an excuse for lazy storytelling, plugging in plot coincidences that are supposed to seem foreordained but which instead seem unconvincing because we're conscious of how he's manipulating the events. To put it another way: You can't prove God's existence by proving the storyteller's existence. I've seen other movies handle the topic of cosmic coincidence more believably than he does. His problem, present in ""Wide Awake"" and ""Signs"" as well as this film, is that he so fervently wants the audience to see meaning in the events that he doesn't allow for any other interpretation, and this limits his possibilities. He's one of the few Hollywood filmmakers willing to tackle the subject of religion and faith, but I wish he took a less dogmatic approach. The movie has another serious problem. All fantasies set in the contemporary world have to deal with the fact that people today do not generally believe in the supernatural. In most movies of this sort, the protagonist can scarcely believe what's happening, and all the other characters think he's crazy. That's not the only way of handling this plot convention, but ""Lady in the Water"" doesn't bother handling it at all. Giamatti never doubts that Story is a sea nymph, and the apartment tenants believe what he's saying almost immediately. None of the characters react the way we'd expect from ordinary human beings in such circumstances. The most absurd character, by far, is a film critic played Bob Balaban, brought into the movie for some rather unsubtle digs at that profession. His presence leads eventually to a ""Scream""-inspired moment of self-referential horror, designed to provide humor at a point when we're least expecting it, but managing to shatter the movie's already shaky sense of reality. If Charlie Kaufman's ""Adapatation"" represents the best that the self-referential genre has given us, ""Lady in the Water"" falls well at the bottom. It shows how awkward this conceit can become if handled clumsily. Giamatti is a fine actor, and the core of sympathy he brings to his character makes the film watchable even as the events around him become increasingly ludicrous. His performance is all the more remarkable when you consider that his character is underwritten. He has some terrible experiences in his past (paralleling those of the Mel Gibson character in ""Signs""), but he never feels fleshed out. Bryce Dallas Howard, as the sea nymph, disappointed me, especially after her promising turn in ""The Village."" In that film, her clipped and stilted speech was part of the faux-nineteenth-century effect that the movie wanted to evoke. Here it's out of place, and it makes her character distant and hard to relate to, which is fatal to her relationship with Giamatti. Shyamalan still does a good job creating mood and atmosphere in many scenes. But the film is plagued by so many flaws that I'm not sure it ever could have worked. The storyline is intrinsically artificial and contrived, and he doesn't build up enough of a human base that we can overlook this fact.",917,5,3,False

Night's strangest film but if you can suspend disbelief, it's very rewarding.

One night he rescues a young girl named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the pool. He quickly discovers she is actually a character from a legendary bedtime story and she will need his help to get back home. Created by Shyamalan through a real bedtime story he used to tell his daughters, it's quite fascinating hearing behind the scenes how the story became legendary in his household and it grew more detailed as his children requested they hear more about it. I'm very nostalgic about this film as I watched it in my early teens and really liked it, mainly because it features the most underrated performance from Paul Giamatti. Cleveland is such a sweet and kind character that really moved me. The creature design by Crash McCreery is great and he also made beautiful illustrations for M Night's book of the same name which is worth seeking out. Massive well done to the visual effects departments for creating one of the most memorable shots in the film of the Eagle in the sky! The cast are all great and clearly have a lot of fun making it; the humour naturally comes from them all! Although it's a lovely premise and light hearted, it has a very odd tone throughout and I think it received a lot of negative criticism due to this and perhaps the fact that there is a dig to film criticism in the script through one character, a film critic (played by the great Bob Balaban) depicted as an arrogant snob particularly in the last half.

Prior to seeing the film, I read a number of critical appraisals. Some were positive, some not. One critic rated it shamelessly in the middle, saying it was a painfully bad script - but one that worked. In short, many critics are seeing the film with different eyes than their colleagues. Two review excerpts: First, a positive one from Desson Thomson of the Washington Post: ""Until now, Shyamalan's work has been one of masterful trickery, designed to keep audiences spellbound until the end credits. But for the first time, the filmmaker illuminates a world beyond scheme, beyond the shell games of his earlier films. In ""Lady in the Water,"" we no longer think of his characters as mere slaves of the narrative but mazes unto themselves. The eventual outcome of their lives is something we contemplate long after the movie has ended. That's the mark of an artist who makes it his business to push the boundaries of storytelling in Hollywood. And that's exciting."" Second, a negative one from Rick Warner of Bloomberg News: ""M. Night Shyamalan made a movie about ominous signs, so he probably should have detected one when Walt Disney Co. executives told him they couldn't understand his script for Lady in the Water. Instead, he pitched the story to Warner Bros., which agreed to make the film about a grief-stricken apartment manager who discovers a nymph-like woman in the community swimming pool. The result is one of the most preposterous and pretentious movies I've ever seen, a waterlogged disaster from its solemn start to its hokey finish."" Me? I've seen hundreds and hundreds of films (I managed theaters for 12 years). And based on what I saw at my theater today, I would have to agree with Mr. Thomson of the Washington Post. At the same time, I can understand why Warner and other critics quickly pounced on Shyamalan. To many critics, his first film, The Sixth Sense, is used as a yardstick against which his subsequent films are measured. And, having seen his earlier films, I must say this is a departure for Shyamalan. But, as Thomson said, ""...we no longer think of his characters as mere slaves of the narrative but mazes unto themselves."" Thomson was merely open-minded enough to watch the movie with different eyes than he watched Shyamalan's previous films ... a talent many film critics lack.

Night Shyamalan used to be a synonymous to good surprises,"When The Sixth Sense arrived at the movie theaters, the Indian-American M. Night Shyamalan instantly became a huge artistic promise. For each new film, however, his name evokes more frustration - and Lady in the Water won't revert this negative expectation. The excellent Paul Giamatti, the only element of the film that doesn't deserve any complains, interprets Cleveland Heep, a caretaker of a small apartments condominium, so well-meaning as solitary. Cleveland has a suspicion that someone is using the swimming pool late in the night, far from the allowed schedule. But what he finds in it is no nocturnal athlete, but a nymph named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, of The Village). Story is there to fulfill a mission: awaken in a writer a spark that will be decisive for the future of humanity. Who is this writer she doesn't know yet, and also can't tell about the designed people that are supposed to protect her from the dangers surrounding her task. Her main clue is a korean lady that recalls of a similar situation in a fairy tale that her mother used to narrate. And, by this point, the mess is already installed. In the scale of the impossible, to propose communication with the dead or alien invasions is one thing; but nymphs in swimming pools, expecting a big eagle to come for the rescue is other entirely - a tempting invitation for the involuntary humor, and one more good reason to discuss what is, after all, the gift that would make Shyamalan become as special as people thought. There is at least two ways of looking at his films: from his own point of view, as the story he pretends to tell; and of the auditorium's prism, of the movie that they are really watching. In his good moments, Shyamalan is great precisely because of the way he explores the distance between both points of view first, and then transposes them. It is his famous twists: the surprise that Dr. Malcolm Crowe is also one of the ghosts that only Cole Sear is capable of seeing in The Sixth Sense, or the fact that some data apparently random of Signs will reveal a step-by-step to stop an alien invasion. In his bad moments, such as Unbreakable and The Village, this distance widens - and here, becomes almost irretrievable. What makes Shyamalan fails is to demand from the audience to believe in everything and anything, without offering a hook, a seduction, or plausibility in proportional quantities. His method, at last, is always rigorously the same. Some stories adapt to it, some don't. And the one of Lady in the Water, that the director took from a fairy tale that he himself invented to put his daughters to sleep (must have worked wonderfully), it's the most absurd of them. Fairy tales are not child's play; they are powerful codifications of feelings and ancestral complexes, capable of crossing centuries and civilizations with its essence unchanged. Shyamalan is a talented filmmaker, that knows how to fit his images and place them in a deliberate rhythm. Also has a good intention: to celebrate the way a narrative is capable of reuniting different people in the same experience. But he is no Grimm, Perrault or Le Fointane. His legend doesn't have a foot that can sustain it nor head to echo with something at least similar to the force of the stories he proposes to tell.",571,1,1,False

I also waited for Shyamalan to break the fourth wall and start jabbering to the audience directly. Fortunately, neither happened. The worst that could be said about this film is that not one producer had the good sense to get up and say: ""Wait a minute! Stop this sham"", but perhaps that says more about Hollywood's mercenary mindset than anything else.

The movie, by the way, is a good one; the only way to get yourself disappointed is if you have expectations of what a Shyamalan movie ought to be.

That being said, I thought this movie had a great story going for it. M. Night truly knows how to keep the pace of a movie at a steady pace, never to make you look away for a second. The movie follows Cleveland Heep (Giamatti), your normal superintendent, with out of this world tenants. As the beginning progresses, you can tell there will be much character development, perhaps way to many characters for an 1 and half of movie for my taste. Non the less, the big story of the Apartment Complex is about someone swimming in the pool, at night. Note: 7 O Clock Curfew on that pool. Saying that, its easy for you to assume who it was. A lot of the story is Giamatti discovering the bedtime story. A lot of comedy in this movie, mostly the dialogue between him and the Asian women telling the story. M. makes a appearance, which you learn latter, he has a big role in it, more than it seems as first.

Aside from Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard, the acting from the rest of the cast is so goddamn stiff and monotonous. This especially doesn't help the fact that most of the characters are bland cutouts that we barely get to know. M Night seems to want to convince us otherwise, as he tries to play with character archetypes, but this manipulation ends up feeling surface level at best. The story is by far the worst aspect, as while it starts off somewhat promising with Giamatti trying to figure out how to get this fantastic water nymph home and realize her purpose here on Earth, it quickly devolves into exposition dumps with lore that's borderline incomprehensible. This leads to the final act of this movie being extremely rushed, with an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion.

However, while there are great moments of suspense and some genuine ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" startles. This is definitely not a horror film. With that being said... this is an incredibly brilliant film with a tremendously engaging story, superb acting from the cast, particularly Giamatti, and Shyamalan's trademark stellar direction. People seem to get upset with Shyamalan because they go in expecting one thing and getting something else. The Village is the perfect example. People were hoping for this horror creature style movie, but ended up with something completely different. I like that. I enjoy having to think a little bit at the movies. Don't just tell me everything in the trailer. Use the trailer to get me interested and then surprise me. Shyamalan has done that with excellence here with Lady in the Water. Do go in expecting The Ring or any of the other formulaic scare pictures Hollywood has been churning out lately.

I liked Mr. Shyamalan's previous movies so I ignored the reviews and went to see it. I liked it. The movie had its flaws, one big one, and a few smaller ones. The small ones were mostly pacing issues. I thought it slow at points and a bit maudlin but overall I enjoyed this movie. Paul Giamatti was very good playing the rumpled lead. He was very believable, likable, funny and touching. He did a wonderful job. Bryce Dallas Howard was ethereal The rest of the cast including Bob Balaban, Jeffrey Wright, Bill Irwin, Cindy Cheung and many others were very good in their roles. There was one huge miscast, M. Night Shyamalan. He is not a good actor. He is not believable nor likable. Given his recent bad press due to his big ego, his inclusion in the movie just turned off the movie goers. He would help sell his movies more by being the first person killed by the monsters or by playing off his big ego reputation. Instead he casts himself as a pivotal character the audience is supposed to feel for. It didn't work. In fact it could have possibly destroyed the movie's chances. Maybe the strength of Paul Giamatti's likability may overcome Mr. Shyamalan's dis-likability. I hope so because this movie has a lot to offer. It is a fairy tale. If you expect a monster movie or a slasher type movie you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a typically morally corrupt Hollywood movie with product placement, blazing guns and copious cleavage look elsewhere. Once you accept the premise of the movie and allow yourself to get into the story the movie is very enjoyable. I laughed at the characters and I enjoyed the craft of the movie. As much as I dislike Mr. Shyamalan's acting I like his skill at making movies. The photography was excellent. The scene construction was excellent. The cast was excellent. The story was preposterous but it was a fairy tale and you have to accept that. I would give Mr. Shyamalan a well done for the movie but stay away from the acting side of the camera. I think it is worth seeing. It has a unique style and contrasts with the derivative crap coming out of Hollywood. By the way the theater I saw the movie in, a Regal Entertainment Group theater, was dirty. The picture was blurry at times and the staff was inattentive and rude.

imdb_lady_in_the_water_gradyharp_20061225,Lady In The Water,IMDb,gradyharp,2006-12-25,5,A Perplexing Film from M. Night Shyamalan,"LADY IN THE WATER is a very tough film to review. M. Night Shyamalan is doubtless a new thinker and has produced some original and interesting films (none of which equal the promise of his first one THE SIXTH SENSE) and LADY IN THE WATER has some very good aspects. It is just such a mixed bag, full of holes and hints of personal vendettas that it ultimately fails to achieve what it sets out to do. The opening sequence tells a tale in charming line drawings about how we all used to be water people but how man gradually went on land, gained money and power, and became estranged from the purity of the water people: the ladies of the water will try to return reason to the land people but the journey will be fraught with danger. Transfer that tale to real time and we find the disconsolate manager of an apartment house Cleveland Heep (a brilliant, stammering Paul Giammati) whose rules for the building dwellers include no smoking and no swimming in the pool after seven evening. He discovers a swimmer in the night pool, rescues her, learns her name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and gives her a Gilead in his meager room. He discovers with the help of one of his tenant's Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) hesitant mother that Story is a narf, a creature from a bedtime story who is sent from the Blue World to imbue reason to a certain man (One who will return 'civilization' to mankind) and then return to her world on the wings of an eagle. Heep takes it upon himself to find the One who will allow Story to complete her mission, protecting her from the monsters in the night that would destroy her plight. In seeking the One, we meet the buildings tenants: Reggie (Freddy Rodríguez) bent on working out only one side of his body (!); Mr. Dury (the always fine Jeffrey Wright) who is committed to solving crossword puzzles with his son Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey); a Mrs. Hill (Mary Beth Hurt) who seems to have spiritual affinities; the odd Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin) who foresees things; a newspaper critic (Bob Balaban); a writer Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan himself), who appears to be the One who will answer the goal of Story, and his sister Anna (Sarita Choudhury): and a bizarre group of smokers and a family of Hispanic immigrant sisters. All of these characters are woven into the conclusion of the bedtime story as we watch the initial tale come to resolution. It plays better on paper than on film as there are so many loops and problems with the plot that it becomes silly. But the film is saved by the actors, Giamatti especially, who makes us love him and his very troubled past shrouded in secrets, and Howard who truly does allow us to suspend disbelief in her otherworldly portrayal of the lonely and needy water nymph. You simply have to be in the mood for this kind of film and forgive Shyamalan his oversights and vanity, and if you can do that it is a pleasant little diversion. Grady Harp",529,3,1,False

I feel like a lot of the negative reactions I've heard from friends have revolved around unmet expectations in terms of shock value. What I found intriguing about this particular film was that M Night managed to tie a lot of the themes from his other movies into a very different kind of film than his previous works. The general idea behind his crazy twists seems to be the unpredictability of life. If you've seen this most recent film, I think M Night's general point about the unpredictable, often serendipitous nature of our world is solidified by his choice of who dies in the movie. The bottom line: life is unpredictable, it has no formula. We all get our fair share of curve balls, and often what we think we know of life gets flipped upside down or just thrown into the garbage can. Shymalan's choice of several smaller twists rather than one large twist in this film reflects well the overall message. While I did find some of the monster moments a bit over the top, its completely excusable because again, we're dealing with chance, not mathematics. A totally mathematical, rational, scientific world is boring, and M Night assures us that we don't live in one like that. While we don't live literally in a world of monsters, creatures etc. (as far as I know), we do live in a place dictated by something more magical/fantastic than what that movie critic character likes to believe. And while there is room for some fantasy, some magic, some chance, then there is also room for hope. And so that is M Night's magic, and while I won't call it the best movie I've seen this year, I will call it a film of hope, and a lighter, more positive endeavor on the director's part.",327,1,1,False

He has no idea how human beings work, period. There is a difference between heightened reality and utterly unbelievable BS, and Shyamalan just kept digging farther down his personal rabbit hole until no one knows who he intended this for, unless his kids convinced him this was great storytelling, demonic trolls that they are. And on top of all that he wastes a perfectly good Paul Giamatti and a halfway decent cast, too. The fault is entirely the director's problem. 'Twas his story, his directorial decisions that utterly wrecked the storytelling here.

She is apparently some kind of water nymph who is being hunted by a grass-furred wolf. If she can get past the beast, a giant eagle will lift her into the sky and bring her home. Hopefully the three giant twig monkeys, along with the uniquely purposeful residents of the apartment complex, can guard her from the grass wolf monster. Seriously. Oh, and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, plays a man who, in the near future, will publish a book that will, Wyld Stallyns style, bring about world peace. And there's a film critic character, played by Bob Balaban, who is ruthlessly ridiculed in the script. I think the thing, as ambitious as it is, could have worked with a few more script revisions. I swear there must have been some important exposition missing near the beginning of the film. And the nymph character, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is awful.

Of course, since the swimming pool is in the US, the ""lady,"" some sort of Queen Nymph called a ""Narf"" is a pale, anorexic Anglo-German American rather than an exotic, regal Asian. She's being chased by nasty beasts called ""scrunts"", all of whom are somehow governed by giant monkeys called ""tartutics."" Yeah, it's just a movie, but I gotta ask how come these beings don't have Korean-sounding names of things like ""wolf made of grass"" and such? ""Scrunt"" sounds too much like something an American school kid would call a classmate. ""Narf"" sounds like a soft ball one can throw indoors. OK, the Scrunts are compelled to kill the Narf because it's what they do. Apparently there are rules about killing narfs, though. BUT, there's a scrunt out there that's breaking the rules! Wow!

The story, though, comes off as though it was written by a ten-year old, NOT as though it was written by an adult for a ten-year old. There are plot holes that distract too much (how can an out-of-shape handyman hold his breath for more than five minutes? - while engaging in strenuous, underwater activity? And seeing so clearly at night? Etc.). The characters come off as though they are trying too hard to make the audience believe that they're ready to believe what's going on - and how eager they are to get us to agree that, gosh, this really is a Narf and not some paranoid schizophrenic asylum escapee... M. Night: OK, so you've read Arthur Machen's stories and similar tales of dreamland by others.

Shyamalan has a way of telling a story with special meaning surrounded by symbolism and a strange atmosphere. His characters are ordinary people sometimes quirky and strange, but nonetheless ordinary. His characters are not the glamorous people we are accustomed and pay the average ticket to watch. ""Lady in the Water"" tells the story of Cleveland Heaps (the always wonderful and great character actor Paul Giamatti) a superintendent of an apartment complex called The Cove. One night as he makes his usual inspections he encounters and is rescued by a strange and mysterious young woman named Story (the lovely Bryce Dallas Howard). Story is a sea nymph who lives in what is called the Blue World (under water) and she is a creature with a unique message to give to the world of the humans. A message that will save the world and its future. Cleveland realizes that Story is very special and very fragile. Her mission is to deliver this special message and then ascend to a world that will ensure humanity's future and the prophecy to be fulfilled. She is in danger from an evil wolf-like creature bent on keeping Story in the Earth world. Cleveland must protect her and help her to accomplish her mission and at same time heal a wound from a traumatic past.

Shyamalan is known for casting actors that are not big names and prefers to cast people with talent and not based entirely on star caliber. ""Lady in the Water"" is indeed a story, a fairy tale with an sweet or unique message that resonates at the end of the film. The film was wonderfully directed, sweetly written, and excellently acted by the ensemble cast.",401,1,2,False

Very surprised to see the theater was only a third full. This movie was very original and enjoyable and Paul Giamatti was fun to watch. The movie actually took place in the same place throughout the whole movie. It took place in an apartment with a pool outside. Giamatti's character was a lonely middle-aged man who was bothered by his past but likable to the rest at the complex. He was like their handy man such as the first scene where he is trying to take care of a bug problem. Quickly in the movie the plot unravels as we already see the lady in the water that was played well by Bryce Dallas Howard. Her name is story and she needs to get back to her life but needs lots of help as everyone around the apartment is trying to contribute in some way. Finding the correct role for the people was tough as their strange gifts or talents may not be the correct fit(You will know what I mean when\if you watch this movie). Paul Giamatti was great just like usual. He always seems to play a very likable character in most the movies he is in. Bryce Dallas Howard was also very good at her role but her role was too similar to her role in the VILLAGE. The movie is a pretty good family film. It had no strong language that I remember. Only a few quick chills. It was a pretty correct length. The storyline was a little difficult to follow and yes, lots were thrown in. But this was the fun of the movie. It also had some funny parts. Overall I give the directing a 9, editing a 9, acting a 7, storyline a 6, originality a 8, and music a 9. If you liked the VILLAGE, watch this movie. If you didn't, probably skip this.",326,1,2,False
imdb_lady_in_the_water_haquenin_20070623,Lady In The Water,IMDb,haquenin,2007-06-23,1,I'm a movie lover and I try to see something positive in every movie I see,"In Lady In The Water, however, I don't see much. I have to say that I'm not a fan of Shyamalan's films. I think he's a fine director, but an absolutely terrible storyteller. I think the number one thing that a storyteller owes his audience, even before establishing a storyline with central conflict, before conceiving his characters and their motivations, a storyteller must establish a world that is consistent unto itself in which to stage the action. I had problems in that regard with the Sixth Sense. I had a feeling that I was being manipulated from the very beginning because Bruce Willis chose not to even question why his wife didn't pay attention to him or people in general would ignore him. At least once, I would have thought, if Willis had the genuine belief that he was alive, he would have come up to someone and tried to grab them and ask them why they were ignoring him. I have a feeling it was a manipulative gimmick just so that Bruce Willis could have a sudden revelation at the end that he was actually dead. Signs disappointed me in the same way. The aliens simply weren't believable and Shyamalan never drew me into the special world of his movie, as there were no coherent rules. I cannot believe that an alien race would come millions of light years to planet earth and communicate with each other by tiny crop circles barely visible from a thousand miles up instead of through high tech communication systems. And how is it that incredibly advanced aliens would choose to fight humans on the ground in bare hand-to-hand combat against knives and baseball bats? These elements are important in a movie in getting the audience to suspend belief and believe in the special world in which the characters live. All along, I felt that the world of Signs was contrived and that aliens were coming along to fight without weapons just so that Joaquin Phoenix could rediscover his self-worth by swinging a baseball bat and Mel Gibson could regain his faith. Similarly, the world of Lady In The Lake never draws the audience into the special world of the rules of the movie to suspend belief. At all times, I'm aware that Shyamalan is on the other side sitting in a director's chair yelling ""action"" and ""cut"" and that the characters are actors waiting to get a paycheck. There are no Korean bedtime stories involving narfs and scrunts and the like. Bedtime stories don't require a rule book to make sense. I saw no point to the story and its complex rules and came away saying ""so what"". In Harry Potter, the rules reveal themselves through the ACTION of the story. Here, dialog and questions revealed the rules, which is bad storytelling. Also, I saw no connection between the main character and the Lady In The Water. She just sat throughout the movie, dripping water and barely moving. I saw no exchange of emotion with the main character and therefore I saw no motivation in him as to why he would risk his life to save her. Again, I think Shyamalan is building a contrived world that never lets you believe in it but instead exists just so an important moment near the end of the film can give the hero a reason to feel redemption of some sort. To me this is the opposite of storytelling as there is no story, no motivation, no building of tension, no heightening conflict or adversity, just an internal and private climax for the main character. The only positive thing I can say about this film and for which I gave it 1 point is in the monster. I thought the idea of a giant dog or wolf (or whatever it is) that has grass growing on its back and that can flatten itself and hide in the lawn is clever and imaginative.",657,4,2,True
imdb_lady_in_the_water_januaryflower_20060720,Lady In The Water,IMDb,januaryflower,2006-07-20,10,Good Work M. Night!,"While the critics may have slammed Lady in the Water, I have no doubt audiences, especially fans of M. Night Shyamalan, will enjoy this movie. I loved this movie because the storyline was very unique and different from M. Night Shyamalan's previous works. Different is not bad in this case, it's just different. His latest work stars Paul Giamatti and the beautiful Bryce Dalls Howard. If you've seen the trailer of the movie you pretty much know the beginning. Howard's creature, a narf named Stori, has been discovered by Giamatti's character, Cleveland Heep, swimming in his pool. She has come from the blue world and needs assistance getting back to her own world. This assistance includes finding various members of the apartment complex to make sure she gets back safely. Safe from what? Like The Village there are monsters who try to stop her from an eagle carrying her back to her own world. If you've seen all or almost all of M. Night Shyamalan's movies you will notice a pattern of twists. This movie is mostly different in that M. Night himself said there is no twist. The 'no twist' thing however does not necessarily make this a bad movie. The movie isn't totally predictable and it is full of some nice moments and scenes, my favorite being the whole ending sequence, particularly when Cleveland tries to heal Stori and has his own little speech about his dead family. The supporting cast of actors who are not really famous yet also made this movie great, especially M. Night himself. If you've heard bad things about this movie, ignore it. Go see it for yourself and conjure up your own opinions! If you're not expecting a tremendous amount, you won't be disappointed.",292,10,6,True

We liked LITW much more because LITW tells you what it is, a bedtime story. It's also a movie you can appreciate as superficially or as deeply as you desire to go (I watched 'Eraserhead' three times and still don't understand what D. Lynch was trying to do/say to the viewer, and neither does anyone else if you read its reviews). It's clear from the beginning that LITW is a fable. 'How can a woman live under a swimming pool?' you ask. It's a fairy tale and that means things like that can happen. I have liked all Shyamalan's movies so far and this is another one I liked very much. His movies make it easy to suspend your sense of disbelief and are very satisfying even though you know there's going to be a twist or two before the end. I appreciated particularly the revelations of the Defender, Guild, Healer and Interpreter and the twists when we find that the original choices were all the wrong choices. I thought the film critic's demise in the hallway was funny and brilliantly tongue-in-cheek. Even if you write off the mythology of the narf and the scrunt and the tartuca (or whatever) and the giant eagle, the story of the building residents was funny and entertaining on its own. Yes, the characters might have been a little thin for some film devotees, but the storytelling (which is the essence of movie-making) was terrific. Interpreting the universe by reading cereal boxes was great. It was funny and unexpected. And while it is far-fetched, is it any more ridiculous than reading tarot cards or tea leaves or palms? Paul Giamatti was very good in the movie. Sure, it was formulaic; in the beginning he's scared (of life and the past as well as the scrunts) and by the end he has the courage and resolve of ten men, but he was believable even if the situations wasn't.

""I have come to accept there's nothing original left in this world,"" he says. This is ironic because if this fictitious character knew of the movie he was inadvertently a part of, he would think differently. It is hard to deny that if nothing else, M. Night Shamylan has a very unique voice. He certainly isn't the only current filmmaker who's original but everything in the tone of his films from the characters to the setting and plot feels a little bit off the norm. In Lady in the Water, Shamylan conjures up a fantasy world that intrigues us in the in the way it intersects with a seemingly mundane group of tenants in an apartment. The lady referenced in the title (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a sea nymph who is discovered in the apartment's pool* by the building's super, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Giamatti reaffirms how underrated of an actor he is in the way he gives unforeseen depth to the character of Cleveland. Mourning the death of his wife and kids, Cleveland is a hesitant and uneasy man with a stutter. However, when the girl says her life is in danger, he is overcome with too much empathy and devotes himself to helping her find her way back home. A cryptic folk story told to him by one of his tenants reveals the identity of the girl as an otherworldly prophetic figure who seeks out three groups of tenants in the building and Cleveland must sift through the colorful group of characters that populate his building to find out who they are. The film creates a constant state of suspense with shots reminiscent of Jaws that show victims being attacked from the point-of-view of the sharks, or in this case mythical beasts that Howard's character is fleeing from. It's main strength, however, is how Shamylan's storytelling is different from anything we've ever seen before. Even when the film moves a little slow or gets bogged up in plot holes, we're too intrigued by Shamylan's vivid imagination not to want to follow along and see where he's going. *One quick potential plot hole to clear up in case you're wondering how it could be remotely believable to have a sea nymph appear out of a swimming pool: this pool isn't a concrete hole in the ground but rather it was built over some natural body of water and the sea nymph appears out of some chasm and emerges through a vent.",440,1,2,False

What would you do if you were caught in a story and you knew the basic plot already, but you didn't know exactly how and when things are going to happen and more importantly who is who in the story? The plot circled around this idea and slowly exposed itself like an onion or like a blooming flower, petal by petal. Also the cast was very good, each of the actors playing really well. But here the praise stops. Even if I would have liked and identified with the story that begets this movie (and I haven't), most of the movie was boring. The entire film had the feel of a low budget movie, everything happening in the same place, the creatures mostly implied than shown (and when shown the CGI was plain and uncorrelated with the acting)and the mostly unknown cast.

Night movie... I liked the Village better than most people, but still thought it was definitely lacking, so I wasn't sure what to expect from his newest film. Finally I decided to watch it, and found it to be a surprisingly entertaining movie! The story presented to us isn't a horror movie, it isn't a psychological thriller, it isn't even a mystery. It's just a nice story, with some good moments and laughs and interesting characters. That being said, it's important to note that Paul Giamatti held this movie together. I especially liked some of the supporting characters, but they would have been out of place without a strong lead. Without him the story (which being a fantasy is already slightly unbelievable) would not have been accepted by the audience. The plot could have had Easter Bunny fall from the sky and steal all the chocolate in the world, but somehow that would have been okay as long as we got to see the stuttering Heap's reactions and emotions. Bottom line: don't sit down to watch this movie with any prejudices or previous expectations. Sit down, and watch each minute as it passes.

I can safely say it was well worth my time. Sure, the acting may not have been very brilliant, and the story may have been a little hurriedly put together, but hey, that's what bedtime stories are like. They don't proclaim to be artfully and masterfully scripted, but they have a quality of wonder that widens the eyes of children in spite of that fact. The only thing I was really bothered by was all the tight close-ups. But even that wasn't so bad. Once I got used to it, I realized this was M. Night's way of bringing us into the world of the characters. This may or may not be M. Night's best work-I'll leave that to the real Shyalmalan enthusiasts to decide-but it definitely had that ""storylike"" quality to it. The story had an original mythology behind it, which I liked. Bryce was lovely as the Madame Narf. None of the helpers were who you'd thought they were. The scrunt was creepy. The music was haunting. And the dialog was absolutely beautiful. Clevland's speech to his children took my breath away. In the end, Lady in the Water is not about cinematic brilliance, shocking and scaring the audience, or pleasing the critics. It's about telling a bedtime story that even adults can enjoy. That's enough to please this fantasy fan.",297,4,1,False

But this one was totally out of control. Those who defend it say that you must get into the correct mood for it - you have to see it as a bedtime story. But children aren't stupid - how many kids do you know who could sit through a story like this being told to them without asking, ""Why...?"" every ten seconds? It seems like Shyamalan didn't have answers, so he kept inventing them as he went along, with plot constantly piling on top of itself faster than he could maintain it. The greatest bedtime stories are simple, interesting, and imaginative (Wizard of Oz, E.T., Mary Poppins). This one is so confusing and self-indulgent that I simply think that Shyamalan lost control of his ideas. He should have scaled down. Shyamalan has blasted film critics for liking ""Signs"" (his best film) and flogging his other work (which I guess means only ""The Village"" - all his other films got good reviews, did fine at the box office, and/or were nominated for awards). He said on his NPR interview, ""They like my popcorn film, but they get upset when I try to make a film that has a message."" Paradoxically, ""Signs"" has a GREAT message (looking for signs and meanings in all little subtle banalities of life), but I can't for the life of me figure out what message (if any) ""Lady in the Water"" has. OF COURSE we don't mind if you make a movie with a message, Mr. Shyamalan. Just tell it well. It takes a truly inspired filmmaker to make a film this ambitiously bad.

No big plot-twists, no kids seeing dead people, no blind girls spectacularly avoiding almost every tree in the woods ... but that doesn't mean he isn't relying on our suspension of disbelief. ""Lady in the Water"" is one of those films you either love or hate, there's no in-between. If you can't open your mind to a movie that's nothing more than a modern (and pretty funny) fairytale, then you're hopelessly lost from the beginning. However, if you can make yourself believe in mysterious creatures and magical beings again, then you'll probably enjoy this little 'mainstream' movie. The Music (as in Signs) is once again a perfect contribution to the images. The casting (even though Shyamalan definitely has revealed his God complex) is spot on.

Night Shyamalan's latest picture expecting something that would either frighten me or leave me in an existential crisis. Honestly, I left laughing. At the beginning, the plot was believable, and I started to identify with the struggle the lady would have to face. There were many points at which I thought the dialog was exceptionally weak, but I figured I would not let it bother me if the movie turned out to be good. As the weak dialog became intertwined with the increasingly complicated story of the narfs v. scrunts, Story's story became less of an outlandish but curiously intriguing story, as I had originally perceived it, and evolved into a picture where I waited tensely with my companions for Harry Potter to appear on screen. The opening sequence was reminiscent of some of Jean Cocteau's film work, particularly some similar scenes from the Orphic Trilogy, and the rest just seemed like another mediocre Hollywood product. Shyamalan had a terrible habit of deconstructing his film from the inside, with comments made by characters that claimed that all stories follow the same outlines, and that ""this is like a scene from a horror movie."" I'm not convinced Shyamalan is a master or genius for this film, because if it was a statement about the progression of writing, why on earth did he waste two hours of my life to tell me everyone is emulating the Bible or Shakespeare by doing it himself? Anyway, it turns out the monkeys that are the most evil creatures in the world are so evil that they uphold the laws governing scrunt/narf relations, and that the Mama Narf just needed to go home, much like in a Disney Movie. In fact, I would rather watch The Land Before Time than Lady In The Water. 3-Stars",304,6,5,True
imdb_lady_in_the_water_moviegeek310_20060722,Lady In The Water,IMDb,moviegeek310,2006-07-22,7,Shyamalan's Third Best!,"In viewing trailers of M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" one couldn't tell if it was a horror story, or a fairy tale. Knowing M. Nigh, it was probably a mixture of both, with a little humor thrown in. That's the good thing about this director; you always know what kind of movie to expect. Of course, that can also be bad, because you'll end up setting your expectations high. And after his other films my expectations were very high. For the most part, I was satisfied. This definitely wasn't his best film, that honor would go to ""Unbreakable"" a true masterpiece. In second would be ""Signs"", then this in a close third. ""Lady in the Water"" originated as a tale Shyamalan told his kids as a bedtime story. Though, it is a complicated plot that involves a water creature named Story that needs the help of a kindly hotel superintendent named Cleveland Heap. I still haven't quite figured out why though, to tell you the truth, I sort of forgot. This story was very polluted. One aspect that really made this film enjoyable was Paul Giamatti as Cleveland. No matter what role he plays, he always stands out. T o say the least, he is amazing. Other characters include a man who only exercises one side of his body, five surfer dudes who sit in their room and have ""intelligent"" conversations, a disgruntled movie critic, and many others who add comic relief in an otherwise dark fairytale. One thing I really like about M. Night's films is that he makes you a part of the movie by his use genius camera moves. By not using fast movements or changing angles he makes you feel as if you are a character watching everything unfold. One thing I don't quite enjoy is that he gave himself a big role in this film. I mean really. It was cool that Hitchcock would throw himself in the background, but giving yourself a huge role? Come on! At least he isn't a horrible actor. Aside from that I love how he put in a moral, just as in any fairytale. The moral is: Everyone has a purpose in this life, no matter how small they think they are. Mr. Heap really struggles with that at first, but ends up doing amazing things, and discovers he does, in fact, belong. It was quite an uplifting film actually. Another thing that didn't go over quite so well was the believability factor. The critics have been roasting this film because of that, I'm not. But I certainly see where they are coming from. The movie goes from, ""ok, I can believe that"" to, ""what the heck?"" But the rest of the film definitely makes up for the ending. Plus M. Night's films have always been about the characters, not about the story. And for those worried about the horror aspect of it, there's no need to worry too much. Sure, there are jump scenes, but nothing that'll knock you out of your seat. Overall, I think Shyamalan did admirably. If it wasn't for the muddled story, and the sometimes ridiculous scenes then it would beat ""Signs"". ""Lady in the Water"" is rated PG-13 for some frightening moments.",541,1,3,False

Take them to this uneven, tedious and, at times, quite senseless belly flop of a film. There were points in this movie where ""the rules"" set forth by the protagonists became so horribly convoluted that all we could do was simply look at one another with strained laughter. The premise is an absolute train wreck. It's like watching a group of drunk tech school nerds play Dungeons and Dragons: ""The Narf must find The Guild and The Guardian to protect her from the tree monkeys and the lawn wolf so that a giant eagle can come take her back to the Blue World."" There are a few genuinely frightening moments-- mostly revolving around a wolf made out of twigs, branches and a sundry of lawnmower debris. There were also a couple of funny moments centering around Giamatti's character, Heep-- a bumbling superintendent and unwilling, tragic hero. Despite Giamatti's luminous presence, the movie tends to meander and poke along at a snails pace-- often doubling-back over issues that seemed to have been resolved two or three times. You know every character must fulfill some sort of niche and in no time, you have figured it out. Unlike most of Shymalan's movies, you have all the angles figured out before the end. No one is who they seem, all roles are reversed, key events happen at a predictable and stale moments. There's no zest, no perversion of the course of events-- everything is telegraphed to you long before it happens. It gets a three because Giamatti works so hard to make the movie watchable.

The problem that many reviewers have with Shyamalan's work is that they have wrong expectations. Hey, but that's just my assumption. However, ""Lady in the Water"" has really weak spots on many levels. Firstly, the suspense didn't work for me at all this time. There were no shock moments in this film. Don't get me wrong, it was always interesting, but we've seen far better quality. Secondly this dream world with ""mermaids"" and ""sea monsters"" isn't really my type.

Clearly I'm curious about what will happen next and Shyamalan is if anything, a storyteller. I like the world he's created, both in the Blue World and in the Cove. I like Giamatti's growth from apartment manager resigned from life to hero. I manage to succeed (for the most part) in Shyamalan's distracting role as the McGuffin (he literally is, here). I like the whole idea of the Cove as a world. It's the Blue World that seems not to fit, like an intrusion here. If stakes were as high as they were, why would one Serunt stalk the maiden Narf? Wouldn't it be appropriate to send an army? Also the ending seems to have been taken over by creatures. The eagle, the Serunt, the Tartutics. It seemed the small quiet characters were pushed aside for the special effects ending. Maybe my comments seem a bit petty especially since this is supposed to be a fairy tale and we should suspend belief, but I think LESS explanation would have helped. I never bothered about these questions regarding another film, yes it's a different genre but it also had creatures and it didn't give a fig about origins, ""The Descent"". Women in caves with monsters. Who are they? Why are they there? Who gives a fig? Also, I know they spent a lot on the creatures of the story, well done, realistically rendered especially in the rain sequences, but I'd rather they be kept more in the dark. That would make them truly scary. It's not a bad film. It didn't polarize me to love it without reservation nor to hate it with a passion.

I especially appreciate his ability to incorporate reality with fantasy. Not every savior of the universe has to be a warlock or wizard. Sometimes maybe he's just the crossword-lovin' freak in Apartment 2B. Perhaps this won't be everybody's cup of green tea (now with ginseng), but you gotta give the man credit - he's still coming up with original ideas, making the movies he wants to, ignoring what his critics say, and putting it out there for the people to judge. I also like the cast of characters. What some blowhards might call silly, I call quirky and interesting. Take the dude who works out only one side of this body (Rodriguez), for example. The guy considers himself a scientist who's experimenting, and the results are that his right arm and leg are super muscular compared to the normal-sized (4 1/2 inches smaller) left leg and arm. Some may shake their head and dismiss this as ""too weird,"" but I think it's hilarious, mainly because I've had conversations about this with my friends. We've seriously discussed how someone would look if they only exercised with one half of their body. We've tried to talk each other into experimenting with it. Was M. Night listening in? The thing you'll most want to keep in mind before seeing this is that it really isn't a horror film. If you're in the mood to be scared then you might find yourself a little disappointed, a few jump scenes not withstanding. But what surprised me the most is how funny the movie is. I laughed out loud more at this than most of the ""comedies"" I've seen this year. The scene where Giamatti attempts to convince a Korean woman that he's child-like is particularly hysterical. I don't want to say too much about the story elements because as in all of Shyamalan's movies, the less you know the better (though there are no huge Sixth Sense-esquire twists). It's just a fun, light-hearted, interesting tale about a group of seemingly insignificant people who come to learn that they all have a purpose and a part to play. If that seems like too much of a ""Sunday School"" lesson to some critics then they're more than welcome to head to Wal-Mart and buy a box of Kleenex. It's next to the Industrial-sized nitpickers they love so well. I know a lot of critics are mad because Shyamalan takes a justified swipe at the most pretentious of them (Johnny Betts obviously not being one of the targets). You see, the most unlikable character in the film is a cynical, curmudgeonly film critic who presumes to be so arrogant as to ""know the intentions of another human being."" Most moviegoers, like me, who find that they rarely agree with ""mainstream"" critics will instantly recognize that this character is true-to-life. Weeeeeell, that's not sittin' pretty with plenty of ""mainstream"" critics, and they are accusing Shyamalan of taking ""petty cheap shots"" at them. You know, Mr. Critic, if Shyamalan's portrayal is so inaccurate, then perhaps you'd like to explain why the theater erupted in applause when the guy received his comeuppance? Personally, I recommend lightening up and taking a joke. Or if M. Night's jabs hit a little too close to home then maybe it's time to take up a new residence.",806,19,17,False

Lady in the Water, although may not be the thriller that the trailers pushed it towards, is still a remarkably great movie with an original idea. Predictably, this movie is receiving horrible reviews, from both critics and many viewers. I do not base my reviews on any one's opinion but my own. Most people seem to be attacking M. Night Shyamalan as a person, and not as a filmmaker. I read this one review that said, ""Shyamalan is a gifted filmmaker, and Lady in the Water, though beautiful, wonderful and breath-taking at times, is another selfish journey for viewers to sit through."" Attacking Shyamalan as a person, and not the movie. In fact, the reviewer gave a seemingly positive review of the movie, but in the end, gave it a C minus. This movie is not a thriller, it is not full of action. It is an honest tale. It is beautiful, wonderful and breath-taking at times, but most importantly, it is an original idea, which has become lost in the world of cinema. I am not just a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, I am a fan of movies in general, and it is in the latter that I can find the greatness in Lady in the Water.

I loved THE SIXTH SENSE, liked SIGNS a lot, and even kind of liked THE VILLAGE (though the twist was so telegraphed that I figured it out the first time I heard the movie's premise). I hated UNBREAKABLE, but that may be partly because I'm an old curmudgeon who thinks that adults who read comic books are some kind of damned subversives. Also, it was just silly. Shyamalan is a remarkably talented filmmaker. Even here, his ability to use cinematic techniques to achieve the effects he wants is notable. Sadly, all this talent is wasted in the service of a muddled and mindless story of a pathetic naked chick named Barf who lives in a swimming pool, some pig-dogs with grass for fur, and big monkeys made out of turmeric. Or something. I've read several reviews that say that it seemed like they were making it up as they went along. Those reviews are accurate. That is precisely what it seemed like. The story proceeds with no rhyme or reason. Shyamalan did not bother to create a coherent world or set of rules. He clearly just made it up as he went along, inventing whatever he needed to make the plot go a certain way. Giamatti and Balaban give good performances, and as I say, Shyamalan's talent manages to shine through in places, in spite of the utter stupidity of the film. Nothing else here deserves praise, though I would like to single out Bryce Dallas Howard's insipid performance for special condemnation (to be fair, this is at least as much Shyamalan's fault as Howard's). To be perfectly honest, I was hoping the big grass pig-dog would rip her to shreds. And then I was hoping it would go after Shyamalan's own character, a pseudo-Messiah whose ideas will form the basis for a total reconstruction of society. You know, like Marx. Or Hitler. I think that politically, Shyamalan is perhaps, shall we say, a bit naive. No, let's say ""stupid""; it's less tactful, but more accurate. Hopefully Shyamalan will pull himself together after the deserved critical pasting this film took. Maybe, for example, he should stop writing his own screenplays, or at least get some collaborators to keep him from going off the rails to the extent he does here.",386,5,4,False

The bedtime story which the film revolves around, develops into something much more complicated and it does seem a little tricky to follow. Because of this, it's easy to become distracted from the magic of the story and just try and work out what's going on. Despite this though, it still keeps you drawn in enough to reach the climax of the film. Paul Giamatti carries the film by playing the stuttering caretaker and helps to ground it a bit more. Bryce Dallas Howard is decent enough as the role of Story the narf, as are the rest of the cast, although none of them really stand out. Shyamalan loves to use unconventional shots in his films, but, as with The Village, this is where the film falls. The majority of these shots are used in the first half and so it is immediately hard for the audience to connect with it. A more traditional approach is taken for the majority of the second half, which assists in building the climax and involving the audience more. James Newton Howard's score is one of the best components of the film, although the two never feel like they fit together. The music seems like it's possibly too neat for it. On the whole though, it is worth a watch if you're a fan of Shyamalan and understand his imagination and more unusual style of film-making.

Night Shyamalan, 2006) **","I was aware of the negative reception that greeted this film but, having watched all of the director's work from THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) onwards, I knew I'd get to it sooner or later. Well, I can't say that I disagree with the film's legion of detractors: all in all, it seems to me that Shyamalan is fast becoming the new Michael Cimino  what with his output having undergone a steady decline (even being awarded a Razzie as the year's Worst Director for this latest outing!). The fantasy elements of the plot showed promise (with the animated prologue being pretty much the best thing about the entire film!) but these were defeated by a largely muddled approach. Besides, the film has a decent cast (Paul Giamatti  though his stuttering character raises several unintentional chuckles, Bryce Dallas Howard  surprisingly enough, much less effective here than she had been in Shyamalan's THE VILLAGE [2004], Bob Balaban, Jeffrey Wright, Mary Beth Hurt, Jared Harris, and even the director himself  who was, perhaps, undeserving of the Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor) but they're all at sea, being either unsuitably cast or playing unsympathetic characters! The film is even pretentious where names are concerned: nobody ever raises an eyebrow about Howard and Giamatti's characters being called Story and Cleveland respectively; similarly, the terminology they come up with for the various mythical creatures is quite silly! Another definite low point is the excessive importance given to the two obnoxious Chinese women, who are the only ones familiar with the folk-tale that could determine Howard's future. Even so, the scenes involving the rampaging root-shaped beast that hounds her all through the picture  and particularly the climactic confrontation  are reasonably effective.",289,5,4,False

It didn't bother me that the writer, director, producer is in the film. He did an OK - not great, but adequate - job of acting; it was not embarrassing at all as I had worried it would be from what the reviews said. The story is quite absorbing and full of totally interesting and quirky characters. The personalities and their interactions are great fun to watch. The plot worked for me as a ""fable"" or ""fairy tale"" with oddball twists and is worth the time and effort to follow. I could see this as an elaborate, continuing story that the director as a youngster might have thought up and kept adding to to entertain himself, and wanted to follow up on as a movie script. Paul Giamatti is truly wonderful as the paunchy and hangdog, forlorn and lonely, but determined ""hero."" The downside for me is as usual the unbelievably poor quality of the creatures or monsters in this director's films.

And Shyamalan has crafted a tale to confound the traditionalists with bizarre heroes and monsters, childlike wonder with imaginative fears, and childish delight at plot turns and character motivations. All of which makes for disorienting narrative, which, if viewed as an extension of the director's ego, turns away some audience that sees only self indulgence (Rumor says the director told this story to his children at bedtime).

Night Shyamalan's movies tend to trigger one of 3 knee-jerk reactions in viewers: (1) you love them; (2) you hate them; or (3) you don't understand them. After seeing some abysmal critics' reviews for LITW, I honestly went into the theater with pretty low expectations, and was pleasantly, and impressively, surprised by this movie. LITW is truly a modern fairy tale / bedtime story for grown-ups. It is a cerebral fantasy movie that demands equal parts thinking-cap and imagination from the viewer, but if you are willing to let Shyamalan lead you through the story, the rewards are well worth it. On the other hand, if you are not prepared to follow the abundant nuances, metaphors, symbolism, and subtle character developments in LITW, and are looking for a cut-and-dry thriller or light weekend fare, then this is not your movie. I think that some viewers (and critics) didn't really understand LITW, because they wouldn't let themselves take in all of the stylistic originality and artistry that the movie has to offer. I won't spoil the movie (for those who haven't seen it), by describing the plot/character details here. But, suffice it to say that you are so busy becoming engrossed in the characters and the story, and trying to figure out the riddles in this movie, that it is only at the end that you realize the LITW has left you with a lesson that makes you think well after leaving the movie theater. The movie's subtle, but powerful messages about true leadership, catharsis through altruism, the power of human togetherness, and self-discovery resonated with me and other viewers who were willing to open their minds enough to see them. LITW is not a movie that can be enjoyed ""on the surface."" You have to either totally immerse yourself in the movie, or not watch it at all. Otherwise, you're left with a sense of dissatisfaction that some viewers have reported feeling at the end of the movie. On a related side-note, I can't help but think that the way many negative movie critics reacted to LITW had, at least, something to do with Shyamalan's tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the movie-critic character in the movie. After all, the movie critic is a know-it-all who almost derails the other characters' efforts with his high-and-mighty (and ultimately WRONG) advice. Shyamalan had the guts to slyly thumb his nose at the movie-critic establishment, and was, of course rewarded with excessively bitter reviews from some of the targets of his fun-poking. Mere coincidence? I think not. I am typically not one for fairy tale or fantasy movies, because the plots and characters seem so far removed from reality that I can't relate to them. For that reason, neither the Lord of the Rings nor the Harry Potter films moved me much. I think it says a lot about LITW and Shyamalan's unique style that I actually came to CARE about the characters and the outcome of their story. Balancing suspension of disbelief with elements of reality is a difficult and delicate task; one which I think Shyamalan pulls off very well with LITW. The characters all seem so real (like people you might find in your neighborhood), but yet you don't find it odd that they all participate so whole-heartedly in a scenario that goes far beyond the logical and explainable. If J.K. Rowling can invent ""muggles,"" why shouldn't Shyamalan have his ""narfs"" and ""scrunts,"" especially when he uses them to such wonderful effect? At the end of this movie, the kid in me wanted to cheer. Shyamalan achieves a fairly-tale ending without melodrama or sensationalism, while still leaving the viewer feeling positive and uplifted.

Although here, for the first time,he may not have implied any of his Twist Endings, the climax, however,was so ridiculous and absurd that you kind of wished that he should've brought up a Twist to save himself from total embarrassment.At the edge of tolerance ,I think he should stop making films for a while before he dwells into complete downfall.He has made a good career for himself,but now he should take a break or try something new.I mean even Hitchkock tried different types of films to show his versatility as a filmmaker.Night's trademark is getting too clichéd and unbearable. The thing is that,you can lose interest in his films very easily.If he is able to engage you and suck you with his films from the very beginning then it's likely you don't wanna miss the whole film.But if you somehow lose interest or are put off by his film's pacing or halfway through then you are likely not to sit through the whole thing,not to mention you would want to miss the ending. Here it's the same case,for the first half an hour or so,he keeps you tied to your seat,but then problem begins when the narf thing goes a little too silly and all.And the film enters it's own world of dumbness. The stupid and childish story goes as A Narf(Bryce Dallas Howard) from another world is discovered by a Building Manager(Cleaveland,played by Paul Giamatti),whom he must help to return her to her world.So,him and his neighbors join forces to help save this creature and send her back to her home world safely.But some deadly creatures are after her and the tenants must work together to save this Narf ,and they are all in some kind of Bedtime story,in which they are one of the many characters.And....oh yes,the narf is actually called ""Story"".Wow,ain't that fascinating.This is pure fantasy ,and it only applies to kids as a bedtime story.Not a feature length film. Ofall the films,Unbreakable has been his best effort in a mon avis.It is a very complex and ingeniously crafted film that never lets the audience go.I loved the pacing and surprises and the uniqueness of that film.It showed that this guy is not another director.Sixth Sense was a little too overrated for me.And Signs,was brilliantly crafted.Once again showing that this guy is not your average director.He made something out of nothing.A simple story made powerful by his screenplay.Although,I think the twist in the end is his weakest.Then comes Village,which was once again an intriguing piece,but there was great amount of weakness in his film-making that I spotted.He underused his actors ,he was testing the audiences patience and it got kind of silly as it approaches its ending.But I liked the twist ending.It was a provoking third act.But it should be separated from the entire film and looked at differently.And after that ,he was just dragging around until the end with predictable surprises. The Lady in the Water shows flaws,errors,and his weakness early on.You can clearly spot that he has lost his touch and imagination.There was no originality.I mean was he making this film for kids or for adults or for both or for simply to satisfy his curiosity?It appeals to no one.I liked his films,but I pretty much despise this one.The story is too conventional,plotting too clichéd,the film feels too familiar/predictable.The concept is absurd and unintentionally funny.And even the actors are just tossed around.This man without twist endings ,is a bird without wings.His climax is even worse than his twists.This Lady should stay in the water,in order to save Shyamalan. The main reason I went to watch this film was not Shyamalan,which I already expected this film to be his worst.It was Giamatti that I wanted to see.First time watching him in a Shyamalan film.Where Night,always makes his actors look dull and then pull a few surprises.Here,Giamatti finds his worst role yet.He is totally dull and pale.It's as if he's been sick throughout the production.He has none of that charm he showed in his earlier films.It is a major disappointment.And Howard,who was impressive in Shyamalan's first film,is surprisingly mute.She is absolutely stone faced.She barley had anything to do.And I never thought Shyamalan could go this wrong to waste talents like those.Even Jeffery Wright is totally messed up.I guess Night was too busy promoting himself and trying his acting chops.I have to say,he can definitely act.And that is more than just a cameo.He should think thrice before he pulls another of those tricks. The CGI creatures are his best yet.Unlike Village,in which we barely see the ""monsters"".Shyamalan gives more exposure to the creatures and they look impressive.Unlike in the Village,where when the creatures were revealed they quickly made you laugh.The effects were well used.And of course the film would be hopeless if it didn't had a good score.And the cinematography ,as usual,is fantastic.Gives the film a richer look.

Night Shyamalan is a talented man, and has a special way of being able to demand compelling performances from actors willing to work with him. But it definitely turned out badly for him in creating ""The Village"" two years ago. Creepy as the film was, its ""Shyamalan-esque"" ending was so ludicrous that eventually bogged down the artistry of the rest of it. With ""Lady in the Water"", he attempts to weave a different layer into a film that was passed on by Disney and eventually picked up by Warner Bros., but in the end this stylish bedtime tale falls flat on its face due to a discombobulated and bumbling plot. The movie revolves around a building manager named Cleveland Heep (Giamatti) who finds a young woman named Story (Howard) swimming in the building pool in the dead of the night. She turns out to be a ""narf"", a character from a bedtime story who is trying to return from our world to theirs. Soon, Cleveleand learns that he is also a part of the story and that together with some of the building tenants, they must protect Story from the dangers that lurk and ensure her safety as she travels back to her world. On paper, ""Lady in the Water"" could have been a good film, with its intriguing thriller-cum-fantasy premise, a cast roster with names like Paul Giamatti, Jeffery Wright, Bryce Dallas Howard, and M. Night Shyamalan himself in his biggest role yet. But the promise is barely delivered and worse, it is delivered haphazardly. At its core, ""Lady in the Water"" is a film that examines the issues of faith and the microcosm of a community - issues which Shyamalan have explored in his last two outings - but it suffers from clunky and boring dialog. It also doesn't help that the script seems to be going for a mythological feel (as opposed to an atmospheric one), yet this picture begins balefully, employing lots of Shyamalan's trademark camera-work and eerily quiet scenes, that fails since the characters are specifically written with some sort of Utopian mindset that does have a bearing on the ending, albeit without his signature ""twist"". That said, the overall quality here is humdrum and ineffective. Acting is mediocre at best and one-note at worst. The cast try hard but, with a lot of characters to go around with, some are left underdeveloped. Giamatti seems to sleepwalk throughout the film, although it's hard to presume and say for sure because it may be the point so that his performance fits the pace of the film. Howard is passable but she makes a good soul of the film. Shyamalan's role as that of a writer seems one cathartic response to the roasting he received for ""The Village"" but in his defense, the guy does portray some depth in his acting. Wright and Bob Balaban are squandered with a lifeless characterization. ""Lady in the Water"" has got to be Shyamalan's weakest film thus far. I'm not saying that he's losing his talent as a filmmaker because the storytelling is still there. But I sure wish he'd recover the lost magic that once inhabited his works.",533,12,16,False

This surprises me to some extent. I mean, it's not an excellent movie by any means, but I found it pretty entertaining in a ""fairy tale"" sort of way, although some suspension of disbelief is required. But doesn't that go for all fairy tales? It's true there are plot holes big enough to drive a truck though in this movie. The most glaring example is the fact that nobody asks any questions about what's going on, they just join right in without hesitation. Personally, if some dude showed up at my door ranting about some sea nymph from another dimension who needed saving, I'd just assume he was insane and politely close the door. Not so in this flick. Having said that however, I still found this to be an entertaining movie in a fantastical, fairy tale sort of way. I think it was clear from the outset that this is what Shaymalan was going for. This movie is in no way supposed to be realistic. Rather, it's a magical, fantastical story, and in a way this gives Shaymalan a liscense to get away with things that he couldn't in a ""normal"" movie. Thus, I thought it worked whereas others apparently didn't. This definitely isn't Shaymalan's best work, but I found it to be an entertaining movie that I was able to lose myself in for a couple of hours.

Night Shyamalan sadly hasn't hit one out of the ballpark since his first movie, ""The Sixth Sense."" ""Unbreakable"" came close. But I keep watching his films with great anticipation only to leave the theater disappointed. ""Lady in the Water"" has some good moments, but ultimately falls short. Without writing spoilers, I can say the biggest flaws are the lack of suspense and the lack of character development of the ""Lady."" (Hey, even fairy tale characters have endearing quirks or charming qualities.) As to the first point, we know from the beginning the Lady will return to her world without much ado. The only surprises are the parts the other characters play in helping her do so. And while the supporting characters are amusingly eccentric, the Lady's character is so flat, I found I didn't really care if she got back to her world or not. Obviously the fairy tale is a backdrop for larger themes of healing and redemption but with little substance to the fairy tale, it simply comes off as a flimsy structure on which to hang ""Author's Message."" Shyamalan obviously loves Bryce Dallas Howard's face, as her endless close-ups reveal. Yet the actress isn't given much to work with here. At the same time, the director gives himself a larger role than usual, which I found distracting--he's not much of an actor, and I don't think we needed him in the film. Paul Giamatti shines in the leading role, and his performance brought tears to my eyes. True, there are poignant moments as well as a lot of humor in this film, but I left the theater feeling as though I'd eaten cotton candy--it was sweet, but not filling at all. 7/28/06--Forgot to mention ""Signs"" as one of his best movies!",295,6,6,False

I don't think I had heard a single good thing about Lady in the Water, my friends all made fun of the trailers, the few that saw it said it was terrible, and the expectations on IMDb weren't very good either. I saw it tonight almost by chance, picking it out from a list of what I believed were all going to be disappointing or at best average films. Before the film was over I had already decided to comment here on IMDb, something I've never bothered to do before. Usually I feel that those movies worth the time already have enough good reviews for them, but skimming through those for Lady in the Water I find myself disagreeing with even the positive remarks. After those two perhaps pointless paragraphs, I would basically describe the movie as: a delightful storytelling experience, simple yet elegant. The best comparison in my mind to another recent film would probably be Pan's Labyrinth. The people who expected another characteristic Shyamalan twist and the people who expected nothing of the sort were both wrong, he retains his ability to foreshadow without his usual and at this point perhaps even overplayed shocking surprise, instead using it to steer the movie in such a way that every advancement in the plot makes sense without being easily predictable. As I said at the beginning, going into a movie with preformed opinions can alter the after-impression. I would perhaps normally rate this movie a 7, but I'm so happy that I watched it despite all the bad things I had heard during its release that I'm giving it an 8 anyways.

With the lackluster ""The Village"" as this film's predecessor it was time to look into a refreshing albeit familiar direction one expects of M. Night and after a year or so of waiting I finally saw it tonight. It is by far, the most unimaginative of all of M. Night Shyamalan's films and to me the most self-indulgent. Most of the time the film seems to be trying too hard to put that mystery and suspense that it feels contrived. I have also noticed a shift in his story telling style particularly his use of a lot of ""Hollywood special effects"" instead of the use of natural surroundings to create that distinct Shyamalan style of storytelling suspense which I loved and saw in his previous films. This feels like a sell out film and I think a wee bit egotistical to put himself as an important though not central character instead of his usual cameo appearance.

Night Shyamalan Starring: Paul Giamatti, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban, Sarita Choudhury, Cindy Cheung, M. Night Shyamalan, & Freddy Rodríguez MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for some frightening sequences) M. Night Shyamalan has become quite the famous director since 1999. His first major project was ""The Sixth Sense"" and it is still one of most shocking and twisted horror films to have been produced by Hollywood in the past twenty years. ""Unbreakable"" came one year later and showed that Shyamalan was not a one-trick pony. After that, ""Signs"" came in 2002 and was met with just as much critical praise and just as many fans. In 2004, Shyamalan returned to the director's chair with ""The Village"". Critics didn't show much love for this movie audiences seemed to be split. Some really enjoyed it and others found it to be dull and ridiculous. I was in the middle. I thought it was an intriguing movie that was very creative, but that it was marketed incorrectly. Even still, it did not live up to Shyamalan's other films. Next came ""Lady in the Water"" Shyamalan's bedtime story. From the trailer and the previews, everything seemed to be in place for Shyamalan to revive his career with this movie but, when critics ignored it, my heart sank. Was this movie one that would finally seal Shyamalan's career as being average, rather than superb? Or could it possibly be the one that would prove that he had what it took to thrive in Hollywood? ""Lady in the Water"" tells the story of apartment superintendent Cleveland Heep (Giamatti) whose tenants are an odd and diverse group of people. One night, he hears splashing in the swimming pool outside and goes to check. He finds Story (Howard), a narf from the Blue World. All she wants is to return home, but there is a creature--a massive dog covered in grass instead of fur--who wants nothing more than to keep her where she is. Heep will need the help of all of the tenants if he wants to save Story and send her back home. Time is running out for a happy ending. ""Lady in the Water"" has an interesting plot, but it is weighed down by the overly-complicated details. The path to get Story back to her home becomes so water-logged and uninteresting that any intrigue the plot possessed is almost completely lost. What started as a beautiful fairytale became a contrived blah. M. Night Shyamalan has always made brief appearances in his movies. This is nothing new to Hollywood. Alfred Hitchcock did it, as well. But, in ""Lady in the Water"", Shyamalan promotes himself. Now, he is a full-fledged main character and, oddly enough, a very important one at that. I'm all for directors getting really involved in their projects (even to the point of obsession), but Shyamalan is a director not an actor. It shows here. He didn't sell me at all and stuck out like a sore thumb. He should take a step back, pull in the reigns, and stick to directing, because acting just isn't his thing. His direction is still breathtaking and makes the movie far more beautiful than the screenplay deserves. I suppose that I should be crediting cinematographer, Christopher Doyle, as well, because, let's face it, the cinematography is probably better than the direction. Regardless, Shyamalan has made a visually-beautiful film nothing more and nothing less. But, if you wrap a two-year old fruitcake up in beautiful wrapping and give it as a Christmas gift, the recipient still won't enjoy that fruitcake. ""Lady in the Water"" recently got nominated for four Razzie Awards. Two of those are justified: ""Worst Screenplay"" and ""Worst Supporting Actor -- M. Night Shyamalan"". This movie is nowhere near the ""Worst Picture"" of the year and M. Night Shyamalan is not even close to the ""Worst Director"". This movie plods along, becoming increasingly pretentious and self-absorbed with every scene. It forgets that it has an audience to entertain and makes up everything as it goes along. Only the most gullible audiences would buy the various plot twists and turns. Shyamalan makes his most self-indulgent project yet, proving that he thinks that he can do anything he wants and that audiences will still tune in and watch. I suppose that, to some extent, he is correct. However, Shyamalan had better watch out. With ""Lady in the Water"" barely surpassing its budget (in worldwide grosses), I believe that it is clear that audiences are not going to keep coming back if he doesn't improve with his next film. Sure, it's visually-arresting but it's about as boring and contrived as they come. Final Thought: There is a reason ""Lady in the Water"" is called a bedtime story.

I liked how he went with an original idea of his own instead of copying someone else, but in the future I believe he should let somebody else write the screenplay while he does the directing. Someone else who posted said that he should do a Stephen King story, and I concur. If you would compare their idea's, you would see that they both seem to think on the same wavelength. King is a gifted storyteller, and Night is a very good director. If the two collaborated, I think we would get a very good movie. Here's hoping that's in future plans. Bryce Dallas Howard is Story, a sea nymph from the blue world who has come to an apartment building to bring hope to mankind. In The Village, she was the only character I really liked, and it is no different with Lady in The Water. However, unlike in The Village, she has a supporting cast of characters this time around that aren't boring. That's where we come to the tenants of The Cove(the name of the apartment complex). The tenants, in my opinion, were all quirky and pretty interesting. I enjoyed all of the characterizations, especially Paul Giamatti (Cleveland Heep) who plays the apartment building attendant who is also the handyman that fixes everything that breaks. He is also the one character that saves Story the first couple of times, but then as the plot goes on we find out what she has to be helped by many of the other tenants in the building in order to get home safely. This is after Cleveland discovers that he can no longer help her by himself. It is from here on that the story becomes a little to convoluted. This is where Night should've let a better story teller write the script. We find out more about why Story has come, and we also find out about a nasty creature called a Scrunt who follows her to make sure she doesn't complete her quest of, I guess you would say, enlightenment for the tenants of The Cove and finally all of mankind. I wanted to know more, but Night is unable to give this to us. A better writer would have made this more enjoyable and hence made it a much better all around story. Another thing that I did not like about this script was his use of a movie critic who seems to know what he is talking about (Bob Balaban). Of course he ends up being wrong, and I took this all as a simple strike at critics worldwide who did not like his last movie The Village. I don't mind directors taking swings at their critics, but in this movie, the critic is simply just a tool for Night to take his frustrations out on. We could've done without him. Overall it was nice to see and original idea for once. After all the remakes and sequels vomiting out of Hollywood, this idea was a breath of fresh air.

THE VILLAGE, for example, shows many sides of many stories. Here, we get ""fake"" characters in a story of humans interacting with supernatural creatures. This could have been worse, but it should have been much better. It isn't classified under ""comedy"", but we get a one dimensional comic aspect here. It's okay that Sham pokes fun at inner city snobs totally outclassed in a real world with real problems. They are all wrapped up in their inner city fantasy that makes them accept the supernatural, but only on their own terms. The characters, on the surface, seem credible. However, we get a ""point of view"" mob mentality from off stage that makes us know this is on stage. Take some of the more famous ""point of view"" movies: Breakfast Club, MASH, and Southern Comfort. ""Breakfast Club"" is totally wrapped up in the view point of an obvious narrator who turns the other characters into stereotypes. She makes her hero the tallest and most super human and most self righteous of characters, and herself the plain Jane who gets the hero at the end, meanwhile abasing every other character as caricatures with no dignity. MASH is a story told fairly true to the book, an effort to give credibility to a story by making the setting realistic. However, we're supposed to believe mob mentality is justifiable, and that one weak person bullies dozens of ""tougher people"". Unfortunately, this only fools the most feeble of minds, and is heralded by real bullies with mob mentality. It not only is stupid, but it is dangerous, because the fact is that those who made it and loved it didn't do so in order to be fair and just, but to give an illusion that they could hand pick one person easy to lynch for a lynch mob to rationalize abusing. And that is exactly what happened during the seventies and later. SOUTHERN COMFORT was a more subtle point of view story. At least the ""bullies"" weren't a minority of one against many. Here, we got a tainted point of view from the two survivors, but it was very subtle. Had two other characters survived, the story of ""point of view"" would be totally different. This movie went into MASH territory, as we get a demonetization of one character, a Frank Burns throw away character who couldn't possibly exist, and is defined as such a person only in order to allow real bullies to claim the one they hate deserves to be hated as a bully. The undeniable fact is that in the History of the Universe, no one weak, ineffective person has ever been a bully over dozens of strong, effective people. Can't happen. That's where this story not only becomes ""fake"", but ""sick"" and ""dangerous"" in the divisive way that MASH became so. Oh, it's nice to think the one your clique cheats and destroys is corrupt and arrogant, but the fact is that if we are in a clique that does this, we are just rationalizing demonic behavior identical to the Nazis of Hitler. Too bad, because some of the other characters could have been credible if not for this self righteousness. It is totally out of character for the Sham, and have to wonder if the Sham had issues with an individual just before and during the shooting of the movie. That aside, there was still an arrogance and self righteousness about the script that alienated people, yet at the same time did somewhat seem to say that ""yep, a country boy can survive, and these city slickers are feeble"", just way too much to not be comical.",618,4,3,False

There's probably a cult following that's going to love the film, and laud its spiritual overtones and none-too-subtle redemption motif. To me, however, it felt silly and artificial. When a filmmaker tells a story that transports the audience into an alternate reality, his first objective must be to get the viewers to believe in this world. Shyamalan doesn't do that.

I won't stoop so low as to insult anyone for liking it. I may question their taste in movies though. Just so my review doesn't get lumped into a lot of the reviews on here, let me go on record by saying that... A)I'm not an M. Night Shamalayan hater. B)I wasn't expecting ""the twist"". C)The plot didn't ""go over my head"". D)I wasn't expecting a horror film. E)I don't had ADD. F)I don't hate nor fear originality. G)I didn't let the critics sway my decision. H)Fill in any other silly conspiracy theory for anyone not liking it here. Now, with that said, these were my problems with the movie and I'm going to explain this as calmly and respectfully as I possibly can... For a movie that is suppose to be a fantasy film, it was incredibly bland and not very fantastic at all. A film like this is suppose to give the viewer a sense of wonder, amazement and the anticipation of what's going to happen next. All this did was literally bore me to sleep and that has never happen to me before. A naked woman swimming in a pool at an apartment complex says her name is Story and she's a ""narf"" from The Blue World here to inspire a writer to write the book that will inspire a future president that will basically bring about world peace. Oh and there's a huge grass-wolf creature called a ""scrunt"" after her and a giant eagle she has to catch to get back to her world after she's done. Ummm... okay, that's all fine and good, but what truly bothers me is how the residences just automatically go along with this requiring no proof whatsoever. No one thinks she's possibly insane, on drugs or even does something as logical as calling the police. They just agree to help her, no questions asked. I know there has to be some suspension of disbelief here, but not so much that reason is completely abandoned. There has to be some kind of grounding in reality to make the fantasy aspects stand out. This is where the film loses me and fails to get me back because there's no recognizable human behavior to be found here. The pretentiousness and overall silliness is just too much to overlook and forgive. The whole film felt completely improvised, like M. Night pulled a bunch of stray ideas out of a hat, then strung them together without regard for logic, even internal logic. It had one bizarre, outlandish moment after another. As if the self-indulgent casting of himself as the gifted author who will inspire a future president wasn't bad enough, consider the scenes in which Story sits in a shower while all the other tenants stare at her as they try to find hidden messages in a crossword puzzle, where the little boy gets clues for helping her somehow by reading the sides of cereal boxes and of course, the blatantly obvious stab at his critics by turning one of them into scrunt chow. All of this is just beneath the dignity of a respectable filmmaker. With all that going on, how exactly are we suppose to take this movie as seriously as it takes itself? With that said, the movie wasn't a total disaster. I can admit that, yes, the premise was original, the score and the cinematography were beautiful and the actors, despite the horrendous dialog they were stuck with, gave it their all, but that in and of itself wasn't enough to consider this mess remotely ""inspirational"", ""brilliant"", or ""life-altering"". Originality without any sense of real direction is just a huge waste of time, energy, talent and celluloid for all involved.",642,4,3,True

The writing is pretty tacky, some of the camera angles are weird, especially when the camera is in front of the actors, and they look into it, and some of the choices Shyamalan made while writing this were probably him maybe trying too hard to throw in some twists and turns, mostly due to those ""maneuvers"" just crashing and burning.

Therefore, when I heard that Lady in the water had been given a right royal roasting by the critics I basically ignored them and went in looking to enjoy it. Boy were they right. Lets start off with the good points, Paul Giamatti. He has been brilliant in everything for the last couple of years and this is no exception. He holds your sympathy throughout, with a wonderful piece of melancholic comedic acting. But even he struggles with the utterly diabolical script. Oh sweet God above why didn't anyone stop the man. It is awful. The Narf, the Scrunt, the eagle of doom, the Ooglies Booglies, shut up. Stopping spouting this MINCE. You can type this sh*t but you sure as hell cant say it (to paraphrase). I could moan all day about the inadequacy of the plotting and the terrible dialogue, but am sure you will be glad to know I wont, I'll move on. The other negatives: if this film was meant to be a bedtime story (sweet Jesus calling your main characters Cleveland and story isn't cool it fr*cking annoying, whats happen to great, y'know proper names like Dave and Molly, anyway....) why shoot it like a brooding horror film. It shouldve had a light feel to it, which may have made me relax a bit and roll with the childish devices of the narrative including the character names. Furthermore, if you are writing a film about a writer who work in the future will save mankind then by all that is good in the world do not cast yourself as the saviour of the world you egotistical divvy. If you thought his cameo acting in his other films were bad, and everyone I know did, then even you are not prepared for how just downright bad he is in this film. I mean he is woeful. The film as a whole just does not work, with Bryce Dallas Howard as captain plot exposition (yeah her name is story I got it, its not big nor clever) Paul Giamatti hung out to dry by the script, Jeffrey Wright given nothing but the crossword to do. Good actors cant save this mess. Just one final point - if you are making a film with a character which is a film critic then don't be petty git and make him an d*ck and kill him brutally in sub scream style. That just smacks of cheap meanness. ""You don't like my films, eh? How'd you like that horrible death""......

It's got atmosphere and imagination, I'll grant it that. But it drags sometimes. Shyamalan is so enamored with his weird fantasy concepts that he actually develops them too much. Long chunks of the movie are dedicated to tedious exposition, as various characters are forced to lay out the intricate ground rules of Shyamalan's made-up universe. The effect of this is that I often felt like I was reading a boring instruction manual about fantasy creatures, not watching an exciting adventure featuring those creatures in action. On the plus side, the main characters are well cast. Giamatti is always a sympathetic everyman, and isn't it nice to look at Bryce's legs the whole time? I wonder, though, what Bob Balaban really gets out of playing boring parts in movie after movie. The peripheral characters are a different story. I find it a little weird that Shyamalan, of all directors, should resort to using lots of funny ethnic stereotypes. This movie features goofy/abrasive Asian characters, hyperactive/silly Latino characters, and even a chatterbox Cockney stoner. Aye Carumba! It's not very politically correct, is it? The monster's okay - pretty good, for a CGI effect. I personally think it's funny, though, that the best rubber monsters still look better than what digital rendering can do today (witness as evidence John Carpenter's 1980s version of The Thing - it puts the Scrunt to shame!) Speaking of Scrunts, aren't the names in this movie silly? What's so mysterious about a creature called a ""Madame Narf""? Maybe the term ""Madame Narf"" says it all about ""Lady in the Water.""

A water nymph is discovered in the swimming pool of a Philadelphia apartment complex by the resident maintenance man, who soon engages his friends and neighbors to help the stranded beauty return to her world (in ridiculously complicated terms). In the central role, Paul Giamatti works very hard to shoulder the leaden-paced plot developments, but he ultimately fails here as he does not have a star personality or the resources of a charismatic leading man to use to his own advantage (Mel Gibson, for instance, might have excelled in this role). A character actor by nature, Giamatti tries playing this maintenance worker as a soft-hearted nice guy, a buddy to everyone, but this doesn't lend much urgency to the scenario (which is a race against time), nor does it leave viewers with anything to contemplate afterward.

Yes, a lot of elements *could* be considered ridiculous and too far out there even for a fantasy movie. Yes, there are cheesy moments of the Sailor Moon/Captain Planet kind. Yes, a lot of the characters are not defined to a high degree and some elements may be considered random/disjointed/.... Yes, Shymalan is certainly not the best actor out there and casting himself as the writer of The Book that will ultimately change the world *could* be considered arrogance. ... and so on...

""I want(ed) to believe!"" - an exclamation uttered a few times in the movie. For me it's pretty much the essence of the set of mind you have to be in when watching it. It's about leaving logic and one's precious common sense behind and just allowing the story to weave its web around you. In the end, Lady in the Water is a bedtime story. It radiates the feel of a parent making up something as they go along to their child's amusement and, possibly, education. It doesn't have to be perfect in every regard, planned through from one end to another, because that would go against this very unusual subgenre's premises. Likewise, the end isn't as final as one would expect... you always need a backdoor so that if your child insists on a sequel, you can go on in some way. The ideal bedtime story leaves you with a more or less finished story arc that, however, leaves enough room for your subconscious to create dreams about how it might continue. It's not the best movie in the world, but it is original, especially in the way it's structured, the way it works. The personalities may not be characterised like in some deep psychological drama, but seriously, when does that ever happen these days in the fantasy genre and who *wants* that to happen anyway? This bunch of oddballs is just another spice that makes this film interesting - my opinion anyway. So watch it if you're ready to abandon all those annoying limitations of adulthood.

Night Shyamalan's latest picture is being battered and abused by film critics for no reason. Reading their reviews, they seem to attack Shyamalan more than the film itself. That is wrong, that the critics are being so personal and nasty about it. The fact is critics don't like M. Night Shyamalan because they don't like his storytelling technique, a very original and innovative one if you ask me. If I could impart anything to you it is to NOT listen to the critics when they blast this film. It's entertaining, nicely put-together, not full of holes with great acting, directing and writing. There's really nothing to complain about in my opinion. Paul Giamatti is remarkable as Cleveland Heep, the caretaker of a motel where the 'lady' is spotted swimming in the pool. I can't imagine anyone else bringing as much life, compassion and comedic as well as dramatic value to the character besides the incredibly talented Giamatti. Bryce Dallas Howard is probably the weakest link of the cast, but the supporting players including Jeffery Wright (Angels in America), Freddy Rodriguez (Six Feet Under), Jared Harris (Happiness), Bob Balaban (Waiting For Guffman), Bill Irwin (Broadway's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) and most surprisingly M. Night Shyamalan more than make up for Howard's shortcomings. M. Night Shyamalan masterfully directs this flick, and although it makes some huge leaps with the writing, it's constantly entertaining, and let's face facts, it's a freakin' fantasy movie! A movie that features plant-backed werewolves and tree monkeys doesn't have to be plausible!

He doesn't so much make a movie, he casts a spell. Lady In The Water does that brilliantly - it casts an intense, palpable spell, from the clever little prologue, all the way through to the closing credits. Each of his cinematic trips thus far have done this - they create a total reality of their own, and you either let yourself be part of it by accepting it one hundred percent, or you don't.

If you allow yourself, on the other hand, to surrender to the vision, you will have a thoroughly different experience, as I did. The most wonderful thing about this experience is Shyamalan's magnificent casting choice of Paul Giamatti, in the lead role of Cleveland Heep. If you're not one of those who has caught on by now that Giamatti is probably the most brilliant American actor working today, perhaps this movie will convince you. His performance here is breath-taking. There's a scene quite near the end =-= SPOILER ALERT -=- where Giamatti's character has to finally deal with something horrible that happened in his life, to his loved ones, and the way he plays the scene breaks your heart - you can truly feel his anguish, what he's kept pent up inside for so long; the truth of what Giamatti as an actor manages to convey in this scene is transcendent and extraordinary, one of the purest scenes of raw emotion ever committed to celluloid.

Night Shyamalan's new feature Lady in the Water. Everyone single one of his near perfect movies have been on my top ten list of the year it came out. Lady in the Water is no exception. The twist we are all used to by Shyamalan is not present, but that does not stop Lady in the Water from being a thoughtful and magical experience. M. Night Shyamalan pulls away from his usual horror/thriller movie formula and brings us into the world of Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). A superintendent at an apartment complex called The Cove and feels like life is fixing tenants problems and managing the very hectic place. This all changes one night when a young woman emerges from the pool. She calls herself Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) and asks for him to take her back home to the Blue World. She is a Narf (spelling?) whose job is to find a writer to help her. Once she finds him, she can then return to the Blue World. Things don't seem as easy as Cleveland thought when menacing creatures called Scrunts prevent her from going back to her world. They can camouflage into the grass and appear as wolves. Cleveland finds out from a Chinese woman and her party happy daughter that Story is from an eastern bedtime story. He spends the rest of his time finding out how to beat the Scrunts and gather a group of chosen people to get Story back home. Believe it or not but M. Night Shayamalan created this bedtime story himself, and he used to tell it to his kids. The big screen adaptation of his story is very well written and flows well. Not only that but it's one of the first of his movies where I laughed my head off. He mixes intrigue with humor perfectly. There are a couple of spots where you may be misled and the ending felt a little weak with the amount of repetitiveness it went through. That didn't stop me from feeling complete in the way it was so magical and creative. I predict that many people will find this movie incredibly dull since it was marketed the wrong way, as with Shyamalan's earlier project The Village. It is not a horror, nor is it a thriller. Sure, I jumped in my seat once or twice and there are some times of suspense but I clearly state that this is a full-fledged fantasy movie. Lady in the Water is a movie about learning who we are and what are part is in this ugly world. This is a message that will prove hard for many to understand and find in this movie. That is what Shyamalan is about and he has hidden these types of meaningful messages in all his masterpieces. Paul Giamatti maybe new too acting in a whimsical type picture but he is just excellent here. I can say the exact same thing about Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard. They have amazing chemistry and they just look so great on screen. The other actors are fun but some can be a little stale. The most comical character is a snobby pretentious know-it- all film critic who suffers the complete opposite of a fairy tale ending. That is going to make many critics cringe in anger. The only character I felt stupefied with is a young man who's only working out one side of his body, played by Freddy Rodriguez. This wasn't funny, or very original. Lady in the Water is one of Shyamalan's best works and I know there are a lot of ticked off people who would be happy to debate with me.

The premise regards an apartment manager rescuing a woman in the swimming pool only to discover that she is a figment from a bedtime story in desperate need to get back to where she came from. Story drags with every boring minute until reaching an idiotic climax. Shyamalan's first four films were imaginative, suspenseful and entertaining. Here he dumps everything out and is in desperate need of a vacuum cleaner. He also makes an appearance as an actor just to prove that he can render this film worse. The special effects are creative and that is about the extent of it because the screenplay is like a game of Operation only all the pieces seem misplaced. Paul Giamatti gives a phony stutter while Bryce Dallas Howard comes across as a victim of a hangover. Perhaps he should kick her to the curb and tell her to stop using up all the hot water.

But of course since it was a M. Night Shamalan movie I decided to go see it. The opening to the movie made me very concerned, little cartoons, and a story that just seemed like a bunch of nonsense. But oh how I was wrong. As the movie went along I started to fall in love with the characters. Each one with there own purpose to the story. A great ensemble cast including Paul Giamatti, Bryce Dallas Howard, and the director himself M. Night Shamalan. This is though a movie that you can only love it or hate it. But I do recommend everyone see it. To me, M. Night Shamalan has redeemed himself from the mediocre ""The Village"", and you can even compare it to The Sixth Sense. Three words. Go See It!!!

So, trying to extrapolate from the available data, I was expecting Lady In The Water to be both good and scary. Well... it is not at all bad, and it scares you from time to time, but the scare in this movie is based on really cheap tricks and the goodness of the movie surprisingly comes from something that, in my humble opinion, has never been a primary factor in M Night's movies: the acting. I won't be discussing the relations between directors and actors, nor whether it is the director's task to take the best out of the cast... I'm not an actor, nor a director, just a movie-goer. But let me just say that even though M Night has always being casting great actors and actresses, they have never shone in his movies (the biggest exception being Haley Joel Osment, of course). Lady In The Water is then really different, and so no good extrapolation can come out of comparing it to the other M Night movies. The plot is based on a bedtime story, so you can imagine you won't be getting a lot of thrill out of it. Besides, the trademark plot twists are not effective at all in this movie, in that they hardly make any difference from the viewer's point of view. Kind of: ""Oh, so _________ is the __________ and __________ is the ___________"" big deal...let's move on! So, back to the acting. A nice surprise came from Bryce Dallas Howard, who has improved her acting skills a lot since The Village, even though I suspect her performance in this movie has been enhanced by her magnetic eyes and a very skillful make up that makes her look even eerier than usual. Paul Giamatti has once again proved to be a very, very, very talented actor. Even though the story behind his character is another non-effective trick in the plot, during the movie he gives an extremely intense (sort of) monologue that is without any doubt the highest peak of the entire work. Bravo! All in all, Lady In The Water is an enjoyable fantasy movie, with good direction, very good acting, a so-and-so plot, but hey...if you keep in mind that it is a fantasy movie (hence, you lower your expectations a little bit), you're up for a very nice couple of hours.",425,0,1,False

That's what I did. I'd like to think that's what you should do. For those who need more, read on. Shyamalan provides us with again with what he always does - something new and original. Unlike his other movies this one does not depend on his trade-mark surprise ending which has, at least in my opinion, disappointed at least once. There is a surprise ending but it is more charming than shocking and caps the story off brilliantly. More like Unbreakable than the Village, this ice-cream cone simply has a different flavor at the core, not sour bubblegum. Throughout Lady in the Water I felt a certain pleasant nostalgia. It only struck me later that the movie bears a number of similarities to the very successful Never Ending Story (the original movie, not the string of progressively more confusing sequels). Lady in the Water took the deadly risk of self analysis and capped that off with a bit of morbid comedy when the reviewer came face to face with the reviewed. I think it worked. I really enjoyed the elemental theme of water which was so strong throughout the movie. I really enjoy water, swimming, life guarding and teaching swimming lessons but I guess it's not for everyone. Water seems to play an important part in Shyamalan's movies. I wonder if he had a near drowning experience. This is a fascinating way of dealing with such an issue. So much wasn't said in the movie and that I really appreciate. He gives the audience a little credit and doesn't spoon feed us. It was never said that the monster was afraid of water, yet all the time it was clear that it was. The water seemed like a protective barrier. It was a symbol and a shield, and a surprise to make you jump out of your seat. Many elements were just disturbing but there was a clear sense of right and wrong and morality. The guardian and his weightlifting were just bizarre and that is what I remember most strongly about the movie because I've never seen that before. The morality of the healer and that the movie did not need gratuitous adult scenes to work was a welcome relief. I thought it was a fantastic movie. I'll have to agree that it is not for everyone.

The older Justin (Justin Benson) has vivid and terrible memories of their time with the group, but younger Aaron (Aaron Moorhead)has just hazy memories of pleasant times. So, despite Justin's wishes, the two do in fact return to the compound they left a decade earlier. But why are they being summoned back? Are their lives (again) in danger? Or has the cult changed into just being another Northern California commune? When the brothers arrive in the middle of nowhere, they find the de facto leader Hal (Tate Ellington), who explains that the group has prospered in the years since Aaron and Justin left. Their primary source of income? Homemade beer. Very hipster. The members of the small commune/cult each have their own special skill, whether it's painting, knitting, magic tricks. The list is pretty finite, actually. But it isn't too long before things get a little unsettling. No spoilers here; the cult believes there is an all-powerful deity who exists only for them – i.e., not a God from any other religion. This entity sends the group messages via cassette tapes and Polaroid photos. The group members pass this all off as normal; to be truthful, I found their happiness to be a bit unsettling. But Aaron, the younger/more impressionable of the brothers, wants to believe and is definitely looking for some structure in his life after a decade of menial jobs and no real direction. His wiser brother Justin, is strongly skeptical, but certain events do make him question his own sense of righteousness. So this seems like a pretty straightforward story, doesn't it? Maybe there's something to the cult's thinking, maybe they're really just harmlessly living off the grid. But then a few somethings happen, and the movie switches from being about a crazed cult into being about, well, the neverending loop of reality. And that's when the movie really takes off. I'm talking about mindbending twists and some terrific special effects. Just like that, the plot zooms from just sort of floating about, intriguing but not enticing, and then it blasts into overdrive. And suddenly nothing makes sense, and everything makes sense. It's a huge trip. For that reason, I really enjoyed this movie, the third I saw at this year's Spooky Movie International Film Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Lightly peppered throughout the existential themes and sprawling imagery are cheesy lines and forced plot points, which leaves the whole thing feeling like a slightly missed opportunity.

This film is more clever than it first appears, because it operates on at least two levels. On the surface, it is a taut, well-crafted horror story about a (possible) ""death cult"". We have some mysterious rituals, a missing husband, and seemingly silly camp activities that may – or may not – have a darker purpose. Some of this is vaguely alluded to in the opening quote from H. P. Lovecraft, and further still during the lake ""reveal"". The scare quotes here are just because what is revealed at this moment is entirely up to the imaginations of the viewer. A certain Lovecraft story may provide a guide, or it may be merely a coincidence or red herring. But once the big reveal comes, everything goes dark, and the suspense truly becomes horror. The subcutaneous level is focused on a theme: the truth of religion, either this one or religion in general. Though this film really only explores the reality of one (fictional) religion, it does make us wonder: what if some religions we find strange are actually right? With so many religions in the world, it is certainly possible that one or more are correct. And if the strangest ones might be right, we ought to question our own beliefs: do we believe correctly? With so many choices, it is hard to say for sure. Though this deeper meaning may not have been intentional, it nevertheless exists and makes the film even more interesting. The filmmakers previously had a hit with ""Resolution"" (2012), but all signs point to ""The Endless"" being an even bigger success. The film played at Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, and will no doubt be seen by a wider audience throughout 2017.",313,78,50,False

Why isn't his body there from every loop? Shouldn't there be hundreds of corpses? Why aren't anyone else's bodies there from their previous loops? Do people have an awareness of their loop? The cult people seem to. The gun nut tweaker does. But the protagonists don't seem to, despite clues that they are looping. The handcuffed drug addict and his friend talk about knowing about their loop, and yet, when it resets, they seem to carry on repeating their previous loop like their memory has been reset. The guy in the tent with a 10 second loop speaks like he knows he's looping but acts like he doesn't by doing the exact same thing every time. I don't understand the rules. So the monster in the sky has complete control of time, and is omnipresent, but it can only communicate by taking pictures on a polaroid camera?! And why does it leave media in such random locations? Sometimes it's mailed to you, sometimes dropped at your feet, and sometimes delivered to the bottom of a lake. What? Why is the cult so secretive about information regarding their loop while people in other loops aren't secretive about it? They come right out and say it. It seems like they're in a predicament, and they would want to explain it to others and ask for help. And what is the sky monster that controls time? Oh sorry, not only can it communicate by taking polaroid pictures, but it can play tug of war. And you know it doesn't like you if it tugs real hard. What are the clumpy, gnarled sticks?

I simply walked into this movie blind. It's from this perspective that I'll put together my short review. The Endless is a film about time, life and consequences, coupled with supernatural themes and elements. The Endless starts out poorly and awkwardly with obvious low production value, stale acting and a weirdly present shaky cam. The poor impression this put on me harmed the film in the short term, but actually left a lot of room for it to move upwards, and that it did. The film itself decently improves once the plot moves from the characters normal lives and into the isolated country area where the rest of the movie takes place. The plot itself is the movies strongest suit, but that isn't saying much. It delivers decently on tense moments, interesting characters and creative concepts. Throughout the film I had to remain on my toes to stay on top of some of its more convoluted elements, which I'm going to put into the negative category. I honestly believe a film's plot should at least on a surface level be completely graspable in a first watch, with still plenty of underlying points and themes waiting to be discovered later. By and large the film didn't capture my attention for very long and its even taken me a while to get around to writing this review.

While they were visiting, the time frame that they had until they were caught in a loop and would never be able to leave was when those three moons were full. So, why weren't they ever caught in a loop when they were living there for years??? Another: they knew they only had a day before the moons were full. Why weren't they hurrying the hell up? Food: where were the groceries coming from? Did the Deity allow them off the commune to go to the market? What did Justin see at the bottom of the lake? He looked terrified when he came up. He's not going to look that way because he saw a metal box, so what was down there? When Justin went to the Gun Tweaker's cabin and saw Mike there, why didn't he say to Mike immediately upon realizing who he was, ""Hey! Your wife is looking for you! She's staying at the commune hoping to find you!."" If the Deity allows them off the grounds to go to the market and to sell their beer, won't he let Mike hike up the hill a bit to see his wife? Were all the loops different lengths? Why did some have long ones and some have shorter ones? And more questions that I can't think of right now. My Big Thought this morning is: what if this is merely Justin and Aaron's loop??? Hmmmm.",332,67,22,True

The actors/film-makers have made a sequel (in a trilogy?), some of whose characters are familiar from a previous film. The premise of the film is that Justin and his brother Aaron, whose life Justin runs, eke out a pretty miserable routine - or daily loop - of boring work and no relationships. When they receive a strange video tape, they return to visit a cult that rescued them as children. Strange markers that look like stony spikes mark the circumference of the cult - and of something terrifying behind it. As the brothers explore the area and forge relationships with cult members that seem not to have aged at all in 10 years, Aaron wants to stay to escape his brother's control, but Justin finds out that the markers contain 'bubbles' where time runs in a loop, some a few seconds, one (you guessed it!) 10 years. The bubbles don't repeat over and over exactly, but start with the same initial condition and end with the same final condition: death of those within when the loop restarts. In-between there is at least the appearance of free will. These bubbles were created by an entity we never get to see, but which is ever-present: in drawings by an escapee from an insane asylum; in ancient Native American monoliths (so it's been around for a long time!); in equations written out by the physicist-leader of the cult (who claims there is no leader). The entity is the audience for the sad shows put on by the unfortunate bubble prisoners, and goads them along with movies, photos and sound recordings that fall from the sky or emerge from the lake. The movie gets 7/10, even though production values are low-budget and the acting varies in quality, for several reasons: it keeps the audience on its toes; it spends a lot of time on good character development, including the brother's ambiguous relationship, but also with cult members and a few others trapped in time bubbles; it can be seen again, and hints in various parts of the movie will become apparent on second viewing; it bucks the annoying trend of constant action without reflection in most current movies. (Well, OK, it's an indie film, so it better!) Also, I usually find electronic scores annoying, but this one is subdued and menacing at the same time, and should hold up pretty well. I hear there will be a 'part 3' at some point, and look forward to it with interest. I do hope the auteurs stay away from a banal revelation like the spider creature at the end of 'It,' or the human batteries in 'The Matrix.'",454,7,5,True
imdb_the_endless_themoviediorama_20190822,The Endless,IMDb,TheMovieDiorama,2019-08-22,6,The Endless repetitiously increases its cosmic horror through its convoluted complexity.,"Whenever a feature, particularly an indie flick, commences its story with a quote from Lovecraft, you just know you're in for a bizarre journey. To review The Endless' plot would be to spoil the enigmatic mystery, so apologies in advance if I rarely touch upon it. Having said that, absolute credit must given to Benson and Moorhead for comprising the film's entirety from the ground up. Impressive on such a low budget. A shame that the further the story progresses, its staying power is also lost due to its vastly convoluted plot that will leave you perplexed for a decent hour of its runtime. Two brothers who escaped a ""UFO death cult"" visit the campsite again after receiving a mysterious tape through the post. Originality is the essence of filmmaking brilliance. It's so rare for modern cinema to host surrealism, mostly due to its non-marketable premise, that both Moorhead and Benson should be revered as creative geniuses. Even if, in my opinion, the plot's complexity is its downfall. Praise must be given for even attempting to convey such ambition. Lovecraftian thrills alluding to the trapped mind state of a devout religious cult member, segregated from society. Comparing the idyllic civilised lifestyle of a brainwashed member to the fearful freedom of the outside world where opportunities seem so infrequent. Bolstered by surreal imagery, The Endless attempts to compel by sporadically implementing ostentatious breadcrumbs to unravel its absurd science-fiction premise, but its labyrinthine complexity forces other technical aspects to decrease in quality. As I said, Benson and Moorhead are multi-talented individuals. Both directing this convoluted behemoth, starring as lead actors, editing, writing, producing and providing the cinematography. But their mass involvement has meant that every element is rough around the edges. The writing often delves into synchronous banter between the two brothers that felt unnatural and often missed the mark. The writing to explain the concept? Great, if a little expositional. In contrast, the characters lack that personable touch, exhuming unusual dynamics that impossibly describe an impossible situation. The banter occasionally addresses this, but when discussing the difference between ""sleeping with someone"" and ""going to sleep with someone"", it skews the tone. The cinematography, resembling the circular symbolism embedded throughout, was somewhat distracting. The outskirts of the camera lens being squished to force this circular vision, with the colour grading offering a pale perspective. The editing was often harsh and abrupt, cutting a scene and then randomly appearing halfway through a different conversation. And of course the disparity in concept detailing and character development meant that the third act lost a portion of its humanity that was built effortlessly in the first act. The performances however all felt realistic and allowed the concept to breathe through naturally. Always good to end on a positive. The Endless is described as a horror. It's not. Even reaching out to its Lovecraftian roots would prove futile in the search for endless scares. It's pure mystery, with an original concept so grand that it unfortunately doesn't stick the landing. Yet I'd happily see more from these two, as I believe their efforts on all levels should be eternally praised.",523,3,1,False

It sounded interesting and after a quick glimpse at the trailer I decided to give it a go. It pretty much fit exactly into my perception of Rialto channel movies. To be frank, it was weird. But weird in a good way if that makes sense. This film goes to some utterly bizarre places. The film starts out straight-forward enough. A couple of brothers return to the cult they left years ago. The first half of the film is spent introducing us to characters and creating mystery around the true motivations of the cult. The occasional weird thing is happening, but nothing too over the top at this stage. Then in the second half of the movie all hell breaks loose and we go to crazy town. I would have to say I actually enjoyed the first half of the movie more. In fact I would really like to see this film given a conlusion to the way it starts out that wasn't supernatural in any way. That's the film I would have preferred to see. But what we got certainly wasn't bad. It's a movie where you never know what is going to happen next and I loved that about it.

While not as efficient and well-rounded as Spring, The Endless offers up another mind-bending offering from the team that will keep you guessing right the way through with the combination of sci-fi and horror making this independent offering a unique and sometimes mind-melting affair. A slow-burning offering that takes a little too long to truly get going, The Endless focuses on Moorhead and Benson playing two brothers, who at a young age escaped a potentially dangerous UFO believing cult, whose habitat out in the American wildlands holds some dark and nefarious secrets. Trying to live a normal life hasn't really worked out too well for the brothers so they decide its best to pay their old cult buddies a visit and see if they can find answers in the past to help with their future, only to discover that leaving the cult and its lands won't be as easy as they would've hoped. Saying too much more about the mystery at the core of this tale would ruin much of the fun to be had but there's no doubt Moorhead and Benson have crafted a seriously wicked little yarn that is nothing short of devilishly inventive, even if it doesn't always feel like the payoff or explanation is as good as the idea at the core of the whole mysterious outing. Taking some cues from classic genre offerings like Primer, Looper and even of all things Groundhog Day, The Endless doesn't always click and perhaps is slightly disappointing in the character development field with Aaron and Justin not the most interesting characters, as well as not being amazingly played by the directing partners, but at least there's a heartfelt effort here with a strong insistence on being constantly inventive and even wickedly fun in parts. Final Say - A high-reaching effort that is more intriguingly conceived more than astoundingly delivered, Moorhead and Benson have crafted a likable next offering after the success of Spring, which helps solidify the duo as an extremely exciting film-making pair. 3 unreliable vans out of 5",395,7,6,False

There was mention that if you succumb to being stuck in the loop, you live forever, albeit in that loop. The scenery is breathtaking. Apparently somewhere inland from San Diego.

First off, it takes a full 1 hour and 20 minutes for the film to get into its ""real"" plot with sci-fi/horror elements. Up until then, we are stuck with two protagonists, formerly a part of a UFO Death Cult, who inexplicably get sent a goodbye video from the cult indicating the cult is still alive. So they go back to the cult and just start squatting and paling around with their old cult friends, all while dryly navel gazing and having some of the most broad, non-specific, generalized conversations possible to convey drama without actually giving us any real substance behind it. At no point throughout the first hour and 20 minutes do I ever figure out who these people are, what they are, why they have come back, or anything at all about this supposed cult. At no point does any of the meandering dialogue ever approach anything resembling the plot at this point. The only thing we get is that one of the two friends feels at home back in his cult, and the other one doesn't. The only thing overly unusual is the appearance of two moons in the sky, which one of them coyly responds is an atmospheric effect of some sort. It takes a full hour and 20 minutes to get that far and literally no further. After a full hour and 20 minutes of NOTHING, the movie starts throwing baffling sequences that make no sense, random discoveries of tapes and computer harddrives, implications of a time paradox or the like, and constant mentioning of a ""loop"" which, as minutes tick past and the film rolls on, reeks copiously of Telling, and not Showing. what basically destroys this movie is it pushes its sci-fi/horror/mystery all the way literally to the very last 30 minutes, and spends the first ONE HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES not only never even coming close to its ""Loop"" storyline, but settling on a character story between two characters who have no personalities and literally no meaningful interactions with anyone in the entire film. Everyone acts like they never really left the cult because they are such wafer-thin non-entities that they may as well have not been in the film at all. they could easily be replaced by any random duo, even Laurel and Hardy, and have absolutely nothing meaningful change in any way.

It doesn't always go right, but this film felt like a good example of how to get the style part right... mostly. Effects are used sparingly, in a way that feels like the truth is always still a little out of reach, and this philosophy seems to apply to narrative and pacing too, never quite bursting the bubble with a cliched exposition or a telling close-up of A Clue, and even giving a few moments of genre self-parody. There's a sense that filmmakers have seen it all before and don't want to fall into familiar traps, which is refreshing. Where this felt weaker, to me, were the few moments where it did so anyway - yeah, the color grading and lens distortion felt essential to some moments, but do we need that in every scene? Or the quick-cutting montage at a pivotal moment? Or the emotional climax to be spelled out at the same time as the supernatural one? Overall, it felt mostly satisfying in an X-Files or Twlight Zone type of way, and there may even be some deep conversations rattling around in your head afterwards.

Directors Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson relate the compelling and convoluted story at a deliberate pace, ably craft a supremely eerie and unsettling mood that's brimming with pure dread and gradually escalating tension, take time to develop the two protagonists, make nice use of the isolated backwoods setting, and throw in some dandy plot surprises as the narrative unfolds towards a rousing ending. Moreover, this film not only manages to wrench some poignancy out of the strained relationship between Aaron and Justin, but also offers a profound and provocative subtext concerning fate, destiny, and free will as well as the crafty and insidious ways that cults brainwash people into mindless subservience. Benson and Moorhead make for solid and likeable leads; they receive sturdy support from Callie Hernandez as the perky Allie, Tate Ellington as the cheerful Hal, Lew Temple as leery unofficial cult leader Tim, Kira Powell as the sweetly ditsy Lizzy, and James Jordan as the loony and suicidal Carl.

imdb_the_endless_howard.schumann_20180508,The Endless,IMDb,howard.schumann,2018-05-08,8,The Gods Must be Crazy,"Ignoring Thomas Wolfe's observation that ""You can't go home again,"" brothers Justin (Justin Benson, ""Dementia"") and Aaron Smith (Aaron Moorhead, ""Contracted: Phase II""), as an expression of completion, return to a California cult from which they had escaped ten years ago. Written and directed by Benson and Moorhead, The Endless is a low-budget psychological drama that juggles elements of horror and science fiction, unfolding in a world where reality is malleable and where past, present, and future exist simultaneously. Opening with a quote from legendary fantasy/horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, ""The oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown,"" the film plays with time loops and apocalyptic visions, but its basic element is the relationship between siblings Aaron and Justin and their desire for mutual support. Living in poverty and adrift in a world that offers little satisfaction for them, Justin and Aaron become nostalgic for Camp Arcadia when they discover a mysterious video tape with a message from Anna (Callie Hernandez, ""Alien: Covenant""), a woman they knew at the commune. Reminded of the sense of security they felt at the camp, the friendships they made, and especially the good food they can almost taste, Aaron suggests that they visit the commune for one day and a skeptical Justin agrees to keep his brother happy. Their return is full of some trepidation as they recall stories about a ""death cult,"" but when they arrive and find that very little seems to have changed and no one seems to have aged, they believe that they have made a good choice. As things turn out, however, they probably wish that they had taken more time to consider their decision. Hal (Tate Ellington, ""Straight Outta Compton"") greets them first and welcomes them back to the camp. (He says that he's not really the leader, just someone who talks more than the others). They also meet ""Smiling Dave"" (David Lawson Jr., ""Resolution"") who never speaks presumably because he drilled a hole in his skull to find God, Jennifer Danube (Emily Montague, ""Fright Night""), a woman who leaves notes all around requesting quiet, Tim (Lew Temple, ""Kidnap"") who forgives Justin for spreading false rumors about the camp after he left, and a perpetually angry fellow named ""Shitty Carl"" (James Jordan, ""Wind River"") whose own hanging corpse keeps him company in his shed. Almost immediately, the brothers take part in bonding rituals, performing magic tricks with adept Shane Williams (Shane Brady, ""Spring"") and participating in a tug of war with an immeasurably long rope that connects to something in the sky that we can only imagine. With the insistent music of Jimmy Lavalle setting a menacing tone, all the fun and games soon morph into eerie happenings, governed by an unseen entity. Birds fly in a pattern in one direction, then instantaneously reverse course and fly in the opposite direction, huge trees decide to fall to the ground without warning, a tiger meanders through an opening in the woods, and other nerve jangling events including the sighting of totems, metallic dragon demons, and a monolith they carved on a tree or stone many years ago. One might sensibly conclude that the Gods must be crazy. While it may be too facile to say that the time loops are endless, Benson ""explains"" them this way, ""So when you cross into one past, you come to a different loop each time. If you want to be really specific, the radius or diameter of the circles they form, as it gets bigger, the loop gets longer and as they get smaller, the loops get smaller"" - or whatever. In spite of the weirdness (or perhaps because of it), Aaron wants to stay another night and then another and the conversation between the brothers about whether to stay or leave becomes central to the film. The not overly friendly cosmic force, however, has something to say in the proceedings and no matter how much the brothers try to leave, they find themselves right back where they started. The Endless is not a typical in-your-face horror film that leaves blood splattered in your lap, but a much more cerebral experience in which the characters are people you can recognize from your own life, people that you can care about. Although some of the scares come across as being contrived and unconvincing, there are enough thrills to keep you involved from beginning to end. Though its message of forgiveness resonates as does the growing connection between Aaron and Justin, to fully understand its message, stay tuned for the inevitable sequels.

That being said... I give this movie a 6.5/10 because it constantly ties itself together. Aspects of the beginning of the film are tied to the end, aspects of the end of the film are tied back to the beginning. All throughout the movie (if you paid attention) you will recognize things and have ""aha!"" moments. Though those aha moments are not all that amazing, they are interesting nevertheless. The main characters' acting is a little bland and emotionless, but I guess the directors wanted to make sure that the movie turned out the way they wanted it to.

imdb_the_endless_paul2001sw_1_20230422,The Endless,IMDb,paul2001sw-1,2023-04-22,5,Beyond the end of the road,"One might almost define a cult as an organisation that tries to control its members through convincing them of an alterted state of reality. And yet ""reality"", as experienced by humans, is essentially subjective. It is possible that cult members believe in good faith and are not necessarily wrong, although cult founders are generally con-artists and the intentional effect is to isolate members from the rest of society and thus from other ways of thinking about life. The story in 'The Endless' fuses a tale of cultish manipulation with the genre of sci-fi horror, in which two brothers revisit a cult in which they had participated in their youth. Still seeking for meaning in their lives, what if there is some truth in the message that the cult had preached? And indeed, when they arrive, the weirdness of their old compadres seems to be underpinned by some profound (albeit disturbing) insight into the nature of the world. The film is low key at first, and it's a little hard to sympathise with its deadbeat characters, although its easy to see how a cult could flourish among drifters out in the American west. It's at its best when we meet the ordinary but charismatic cult leader. But when the really strange stuff starts happening, it's too random and inexplicable to make any kind of sense. You could make a good trailer for this movie; but there's no fundamental coherence to its superficial atmospherics. You can hint at the supernatural without showing it directly; once you start showing the impossible, your story has nowhere left to go. 'The Wicker Man' arguably covered similar ground much more effectively.",275,3,0,False

It has just the right amount of mystery and intrigue to hold you to your seat until you find out what's really going on. You can tell it's a small budget project, but it isn't hampered by that. The two main characters, Aaron (played by Aaron Moorhead) and Justin (played by Justin Benson), escaped from a cult when they were kids. They were struggling trying to make a life for themselves in the real world when they received a video from their old commune. For Aaron it drummed up a bit of nostalgia and he wanted to go back just to visit. Justin, the more commanding of the two, didn't want anything to do with the place, but they went back to visit anyway. It didn't take long to see that something wasn't quite right there. Everyone at this southern California commune was stuck in an endless loop. Justin and Aaron would also be stuck in a loop there if they didn't get out by the appearance of the ""third moon"" (meaning that three moons would be in the sky). Then there was a point in the movie where I had deja vu. No, stronger than that. I had full on, ""I've seen this very scene before in another movie."" Sure enough, there was a scene that was from another movie Justin and Aaron directed called ""Resolution"" (2012). It's only been three years since I've seen ""Resolution,"" but that was about 300 movies ago.

However, there was something about the synopsis and the artwork that really intrigued me so I did some research and found quite a few people saying that the horror movie monicker isn't entirely accurate. Let me add to that group by saying that, in my opinion, not only would I not call The Endless a horror movie, I think even calling it a thriller would be a stretch. Is it a weird and off-kilter movie? Absolutely. Having said all of that, I didn't find myself all that tense or disturbed watching the events unfold. Instead, I was intrigued seeing things play out and spent the runtime trying to figure out where they were going. The movie kept my interest and did a good job of pacing but (ironically) I feel that it would have benefitted from a bit more tension and unease. What I liked: -There was enough substance here to keep me invested and thinking. On top of that, I appreciate that the audience is given a fairly concrete ending while still leaving plenty of mysteries to ponder. -The acting was good and the score was well done. -There are some interesting visuals and standout moments. What I didn't like: -Keeping things vague, the setup to the movie just doesn't make sense to me at all and could have used more development. -There are a lot of absolutely bizarre things going on but most of the characters (with a few significant exceptions) and especially the leads seem to accept everything with very little fear or resistance which dramatically deflates the tension. Overall, I would say that The Endless is a smart movie that raises some interesting and open-ended existential and philosophical questions and can be interpreted on many different levels which I think makes it a success even though I can't help but feel that it's just barely missing something that could have made it a truly excellent.",350,1,1,False

No one was wooden and it was surprising to see everyone delivering a solid performance knowing the budget was slim. The acting is probably the best aspect of the movie.

Pay-off: Remember when I wrote above that this would have been a great novel? Well, that is because you can just explain what the entity looks like without needing technology to visually see it. Because they didn't have the budget to create the entity, they just never show it. Though, going off of what you do see, it was probably best that they didn't attempt to show the deity, as it would have created a cheesy moment in an otherwise serious-leaning movie.

Cult horror is not my genre, but I got into this. It's a substantial film, well performed and edited, so the pace is good. Everything tinted yellow in what looks like the scraggy location for a '70s California TV series, and an atmosphere of eerie isolation is created. Performances are good too, although the dynamic between the characters never really gets the story going - that depends on a time loop concept, with a ticking timebomb in the cycle of the weird moons. There is one well executed scene where a doomed couple - a random guy looking for his wife and a drying out addict chained to the wall - carry the exposition of the nature of the threat with good humour. But then, the story telling lets itself down with what I'd call emotional exposition plonked right into the climax as the brothers push their car away from danger while figuring out how they feel about each other. There's also a few problems, like the non-connect between the random guy and his wife, and the practicalities of the cult being trapped yet relying on the outside world. Also a reference to abuse that isn't carried through in the plot - a similar throwaway line was used in the directors' earlier movie Spring to no purpose. I definitely don't consider this horror, and I doubt it's really sci-fi either but more of a metaphysical adventure. American cults seem to stem from the problem extreme protestantism has in dealing with a reality that doesn't reflect what scripture says. In that vein, this is a thoughtful speculation on a world dominated by a higher power, where even time is a myth, and life is for preppers bewildered by the coming Apocalypse. Does it hit the right emotion? Hmmm - that end scene in the car kinda clouded it for me. Overall - big improvement on Spring, and although not a completely integrated story it got me thinking, so well worth it.",358,1,2,False

I'm pretty sure this would've pissed me off much more if I hadn't. Resolution (2012) was an ok experiment with zero budget that somewhat resembled an indy mystery movie (it was never a horror movie). It kind of made sense even though it had no ending at all (it just stopped). It had some flaws like amateur cinematography and weird editing but the acting and some interesting writing and dialogue were what made it work. The Endless (2017) is a follow-up to that film and while it does perform better overall it is still bloated with a lot of unnecessary content. It provides an understandable ending to the first film as well. First with the good stuff. The story is much more comprehensible this time, the relationship between the brothers is better written and at least the older brother gets a real character arc. It picks up some of the characters from the old film once again, which was nice to see. The film also has a couple of interesting ideas on what life is and what our basic lifestyle represents if you look at it from the other angle, it's cool. Now for the bad stuff though.

The biggest problem of the film was lots of pointless hipster pseudophilosophical dialogue that meant absolutely nothing for a sane person. It was clearly in the film just to show scenes of people socializing while smartly talking about nonsense to please specific audiences who love pretentious smart talk.

When they escape from the cult, Justin tells the media that they were members of a bizarre alien death cult that practiced massive suicide and castrate males, although the younger Aaron recalls them as an amicable commune. Presently they are losers and under therapy, since they are unable to find job or make friends. When they receive a VHS tape from the cult, Aaron convinces his protective brother to visit Camp Arcadia just for one day to see his acquaintances and say goodbye. They are welcomed by the leader Hal (Tate Ellington) that brings them to have lunch with their former friends that have not aged. The beautiful Anna (Callie Hernandez) shows interest in Aaron, who asks Justin to stay one more day. Along the next day, Justin makes discoveries and notes that people in that area are stuck in time loops under the control of a mysterious entity. ""The Endless"" (2017) is a movie in the style of David Lynch about an alien death cult.

The Endless is about two brothers who escaped a ""UFO death cult"" 10 years prior to the start of the movie, and follows them when they decide to revisit the cult, slowly realizing that there may be more truth to what these fanatics worship than they originally thought. The writing is amazing, the best I have seen in quite a while. Constantly teasing you and pulling you along through this mysterious and captivating story.

My only wish is that it had a higher budget, some things had to be shown off screen and some effects didn't look too great, but they did a lot with what they had, especially for how ambitious this film was. I would have loved to have seen what some of this could have looked like if they had just a bit more $ to throw at it. That being said, there were also some great effects, especially towards the finale, you can tell that was where most of it went.

However, when none of the cult's predicted events come to pass and a strange video surfaces, the brothers decide to revisit their old friends within the cult. The question lingers: will they be drawn back into the cult or find reassurance that they made the right choice initially?

The cast includes Callie Hernandez (Shotgun Wedding), Tate Ellington (Sinister 2) and Sam Brady (Doctor Sleep). The Endless offers a highly unique cult storyline that is executed well and is entertaining to watch unfold. The concept of a UFO suicide cult was intriguing, and the opening scene with the tree and rope creates an incredible sense of unease that permeates the entire film. The two brothers can be somewhat annoying, but this actually adds to the intrigue of their fate. The film introduces numerous random characters and situations, providing several good twists and turns. However, the ending might leave you somewhat disappointed, and I would have preferred more glimpses of ""what"" is in the woods.

Slowly as the days pass, the strange phenomena starts to happens more and more to them and they discover that the place is actually a mini pocket dimension in the middle of a arid zone where circular pockets of space time and an invisible multidimensional creature lives roams around and time reset (in the most horrible ways sometime) over and over, with their dwellers dying and living over and over. Yup, to me the definition of living hell. This is not clear since the beginning only starts around middle run of the movie to pick up till the end in the lines of low budget good idea productions like ""Project Almanac"" (2017), ""Primer"" (2004), ""Synchronic"" (2019).

Only to visit the cult as adults, cause they received some video on the mail that they felt like their group of people were going to commit a mass suicide. For those, that enjoy the mythical concept idea of Lovecraftian entity and so on would definitely find this entertaining. The plot is definitely one of those movies, were it is best to see it without knowing much about it. Avoid reading spoilers or seeing trailers/clips. Brothers Justin and Aaron (Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead) are both wanting to visit a group of people they know that lives out in the middle of nowhere. They left when they were younger cause they feared the cult was not any good to them. After receiving a mysterious video that they feared the group lives are at stake. They visit them and see that their old friends and everyone are all happy and still participating in their daily routine. However, they both start to become very suspicious when they notice every thing is strange. Which they fear the group may know something that they do not? Or could there paranoia really be getting to them? The plot was a great mystery concept that throws in some Lovecraftian themes. There are plenty of creepy moments. When the brothers feels like they are being watched by something. Or shadows of something bigger. The idea of the cult and their reason to their activities is also kind of creepy. I was never once bored with the movie. I was intrigued to see more but when the climax happens with the brothers trying to escape it is intense. Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are both good with their characters. Playing brothers that wants a better life for themselves. But they both care about the friends and people they once knew in the cult. The film does have a slower pace in the second act when the brothers are visiting the people in the cult and hearing their perspective on what lays ahead.

The premise of an alien cult that ascends into space after... no being alive anymore isn't the most creative but the angle they took is great. It's such a unique version of that idea and I really enjoyed it! I don't want to ruin it with spoilers but I finished watching this film over 20 minutes ago and I'm still pondering a few things. The music choice is great, not over done with lots of beautiful piano scores and House of the Rising Sun is a fantastic song overall and I think fits the weird hippie/spooky feel of the movie fantastically. The cover during the end credits is beautiful and felt like a good conclusion to such a mind-bending movie. Definitely has some room for improvement... Most of the acting leaves a lot to be desired, the two main characters and the ""cabin tweaker"" are the worst offenders. At some points it adds to the uncanny valley feel but sometimes it feels like you're at a really bad local theater troupe performance. Instead of shooting at dusk or night using lights they throw on a horrible blue/grey filter. Using the handheld camera during scenes where it could have been more powerful with steady, drawn-out shot feels like a bad choice most of the time. I know that was probably a budget/time constraint but in my opinion it looks really bad. There's a few plot lines that don't get resolved and the ending felt a little rushed but overall, I think it's worth a watch. With all the flaws, the monster and mystery still make it worth your time.",301,0,1,False

As in those films, character dialogue is particularly important (which set Benson and Moorhead apart from most contemporary horror film-makers). The dialogue style of the characters-- short bursts of often esoteric or sarcastic assertions -- is definitely close to that used in the earlier movies, with this difference: this film features multiple narratives and a much larger cast. Thus, the task of ""bringing it all together"" is much more difficult. Did they succeed? Mostly. At first, what was personal and believable between the main characters in ""Spring' and ""Resolution"" was not terribly believable here: the whole idea of a ensemble of contemporary-clad 20 and 30-somethings in the forests of SoCal drinking beer, smoking what-not and being part of some ill defined cult. I was all-too-conscious of the artifice at times for the first thirty minutes or so. Frankly, it was all a bit stiff and wooden for me. But, as in ""Spring"" and ""Resolution,"" the directors hold their ""weird cards"" for the second half. Thus, what begins as a bit of a clumsy slow burn becomes far more focused (yet also more surreal/psychological or ""Lynchian"") as the movie progresses. With the benefit of hindsight, then, the dialogue actually works as a reasonable means to a good end. (As an aside: The integration of certain ""Resolution"" scenes into this film is really rather clever.) I would compare ""The Endless"" to ""Equinox"" (1970), ""The Axiom"" (2018) or even ""Braid"" [""Dying to Play""] (2018)"" to analogize its mood and working premises. And like ""Braid,"" there are some superior themes at work here that, while never fully un-spooled, give the viewer a great deal to think about: repetition vs salvation, the novelty of danger/addiction vs. The tedium of stability, group acceptance vs. Social death, the desire for both a home and a new start.

It begins with two lonely brothers: Aaron (Aaron Moorhead) and Justin (Justin Benson); as kids, they escaped a UFO death cult; nowadays, they receive a video cassette in the mail made by Camp Arcadia, a group they belonged long time ago. Fed up with their inability to make friends or find good jobs since leaving Camp Arcadia, Aaron convinces Justin to return to the Ascension cult and see what has become of the family they left behind. Aaron and Justin go back for just one day, but there they're forced to reconsider the cult's beliefs when confronted with unexplainable phenomena surrounding the camp. They discover time passes differently than on the ordinary life. Time is a prison !. Deep in the unknown, where time stands still, the only way to survive is to escape !. With a modest budget inversely proportional to the amount of ingenuity or inventiveness deployed, actors/writers/directors Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson contributed to an elaborate supernatural premise that is carried out with minimal FX, but which works without missing the usual pyrotechnic display of the genre. A surprising film that contains intrigue, temporal paradoxes, thrills, emotions, tense, fantastic events, plot twists and nice special effects. The film manages to bring together the various premises, forming a potpourri that fit together like a silk glove; though there're some unexplained questions. Adding a number of surprises that develop throughout until the ending to eventually join them to a weird conclusion. Given the limited budget, the directors themselves play the leading duo - even keeping their names - a pair of siblings who, upon returning to the dark and sinister sect in which they were raised, discover that there really is something paranormal behind all the inexplicable phenomena that occur around them. Along with two protagonists: Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson, other actors as Tate Ellington and Callie Hernandez lead the cast of this film, which also features performances by Shane Brady, Lew Temple and some of the actors who appeared in the directors' debut, such as Peter Cilella, Vinny Curran or Emily Montague. It is a better than expected film despite its limited budget. It is truly unprecedented how such a good science fiction film could have been made with two unknown directors, shoestring budgets and without renowned actors. The motion picture was acceptably played/written/directed by newcomers fimmakers Justin Benson, Aaron Moorhead. This second horror and sci-fi film made by this pair of filmmakers - after their debut with ""Resolution"" - was presented and awarded at the prestigious Sitges and Tribeca festivals in 2017 and quickly became a critical success.

I'd like how they gave you little pieces throughout the movie until they finally did the reveal of what was going on halfway through the movie. Everyone in the forest is apparently stuck in different time loops in the characters are very self-aware of this because they are the ones that explain it to the 2 guys that return to the UFO cult. Apparently the time Loop is for the amusement of some invisible creature you never see that rules the forest. And what they're told us as the Story Goes On is that if they don't get out of there by the time the third move is complete they will be stuck in the time loop with the rest of them and never be able to leave and never be able to die. But there in lies the problem unless I miss something in the movie which I don't think I did they apparently were in The Cult when they were younger in fact when the movie begins before they go back to the cult with one of the brothers talking about how much he was missing the camaraderie and the good food they used to give them in the cult. In fact he was the one that talked his brother into going back. From the backstory you get the idea that they had lived there a while before leaving. And the reason why I'm saying all this is because this is where the story falls apart because when it's revealed to them that they need to be out of there before the third moon or else be stuck in the time Loop forever that doesn't make sense because if they live there for a while 10 years prior to coming back and visiting by the rules of the movie they should already be stuck in the time Loop because they already spent enough time in the forest to make that happen. That is why the story doesn't work because it doesn't follow its own rules. That is why when I finish the movie I thought the ending was going to be only the forest making it look like they got out( because it's also explained in the movie that the monster in the forest has the ability to change and add things to the forest and try to keep people lost in it so they get stuck in the time Loop.) but they too were stuck in a Time Loop of their own that they were unaware of. But the ending is them breaking out just before reset of the forest caught up to them. Which does not make sense given the other rules of the story because they should be stuck in the time Loop just like everybody else because of the amount of time they where there before. Also usually people stuck in a Time Loop are not self-aware of the time at least in other time Loop stories because it would be like hitting reset on a video game none of the characters in the video game are aware of the fact that they've just been reset. But that's kind of a side issue compared to the major flaw in the story. Which is they should be stuck in the time loop with everybody because of how long they lived there before their return at the start of the movie.,578,4,4,True

How often they go wrong, but when they go right, magic happens. Aaron Moorehead and Justin Benson are a writer/director pair that have managed to make a handful of movies on virtually no money. They are models to be admired. The Endless is the first of their films I've seen, and I think it's a wonderful example of what a smart script, tight direction, and solid acting can accomplish even without any real financial backing. The two play the movie's two main characters (Aaron and Justin, oddly enough) are brothers who escaped from a death cult ten years before. They live a meager existence cleaning apartments and eating ramen when a package arrives with a video tape from the camp they left. Prompted by that and their general miserable existence, Aaron convinces Justin that they should visit only for a day. They go and life is ideal. Everyone's happy. Everyone's useful and doing what they want to do. It seems so much better than their memories and their fears led them to believe, but there are eerie things happening around them. They see a man, marching around the area with strictly determined focus that borders on hostility. There's a woman who cries for her missing husband. There's a lake where they go to fish and Justin is scared beyond reason at the sight of something he sees underwater when he goes diving. There's something wrong with this life, and no one can explain why. The movie actually begins with an H.P. Lovecraft quote, so going through all of these motions with that in the back of your mind makes the end point rather clear. There's a horror that cannot be explained or reasoned lurking around every corner. This is when we get introduced to the trippier part of the story. I don't think it holds together completely (it might, but it feels like there are a few holes in the logic placed there for dramatic purposes), but it overall adds to the pervasive sense of impending doom in such a great way. The writer/director pair understand how to use images and especially sound design to heighten tension. And that's really what drives the movie forward through the end. That feeling of dread and tension that just keeps building until its climax. On top of that, characterization is wonderful. The two brothers not only feel like brothers (with all the minor bickering that that entails) but they also have completely different sets of beliefs that set them apart and make them distinct. Even the most minor of characters (like the gun tweeker and his friend whom we see for about 5 minutes) have a breadth of characterization that makes them far more than merely exposition dumps. There's so much to admire in this film. I loved it.

Consequently I went back for an attempt at a second watch, and I sincerely realized that I didn't miss anything at all, especially considering what painful a watch the first and attempted repeat was, much like a loop needing to be escaped.

The setup is: two brothers who were essentially raised in a rural cult escape during their teens and in the decade since, have been struggling to get by. The younger brother has more positive memories of the so-called cult and when they receive what seems to be an invitation, he insists they visit, with the older brother being very suspicious and negative. Of course the ""cult"" turns out to be not so evil. Or is it? Strange things happen. Is that the cultists fault or is something bigger going on? The philosophical question turns out to be: is it better to live a safe, predictable but confined existence where you're certain of some degree of happiness; or to live a life that's probably not going to be happy, but is freer and the possibilities are greater? One quibble: the filmmakers play the two brothers, maybe to save on money (great actors, they are not) and they both look too old for the roles, which was a little confusing since I thought it might be a time-travel-related clue.

Lovecraft. In The Endless, two brother who recently escape from a cult receive a mysterious tape from said group, inciting them to journey back to the secluded and mysterious Camp Arcadia. Without giving too much away, suffice to say there is something very, very wrong on the campgrounds, something that desires to toy with the populace of Camp Arcadia as well as others unfortunate enough to be caught in its grasp. The acting is a bit stale in some scenes, however, the brothers (acted by directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead) manage to convincingly portray the ups and downs of a familial relationship in a time of hardship in a manner both brilliant and natural. The effects are well used and sparingly implemented, giving shape but no form to the forces at work throughout the film, although one could easily be very nauseating for those suffering from motion sickness. While the comedic elements usually fall somewhat flat, the atmosphere and brilliant concepts at play make this a must watch for horror enthusiasts and Lovecraft fans alike, as well as those interested in unique or experimental film techniques.

I was excited as I'm a fan of time travel/loops, which I knew this was featuring coming in. I was also getting into more Lovecraftian stuff, which was something else that I heard was a part of this. I hadn't seen it since then though so I was excited to check this out when needing a movie from Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, the directors, for an October movie challenge. Synopsis: about two brothers that return to the cult they fled from years ago to discover that the group's beliefs may be saner than they once thought. The story itself was something that really intrigued me when I saw trailers for it. We have two brothers, Justin (Benson) and Aaron Smith (Moorhead). Benson also wrote this. They flee from the cult and are living mundane lives in the real world. We get to see news footage of them after they made it out. The problem though is that Aaron doesn't remember the bad things that Justin tells him happened. He harbors feelings of wanting to go back. What sets it off is that a package comes with a video of Anna (Callie Hernandez). Aaron remembers her to an extent and wants to visit to see what it was like. It does take convincing, but Justin relents. It is on their trip back when they stop at a memorial that we learn the two brothers are orphans. Their mother died in a car accident and they were brought to the commune by Hal (Tate Ellington). Our brothers return to the commune and we get to see their way of life. They live and eat healthy. We learn that the people living there are much older than we realize. Hal tries to state that it is due to the lifestyles they live, but it could be something more to it. There also is something much darker that is surrounding all of this and much scarier than they realize. Justin gets to see this as he is forced to leave. There are others living around this area who also seem to be stuck. That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. I do have to say, I loved the concept that is revealed about what is up with this cult. The film starts with a quote from H. P. Lovecraft so keep that in mind when watching this film. Time is also something that is brought up and I'm a sucker for films with that concept. It is something that I both cannot wrap my head around and am drawn to films that involve it. I did have issues with the third act of this film and the ending. I just feel this film bit off more than it could chew. Delving a bit deeper here, I do find how this is presented to be interesting. It shows how difficult life is for Aaron and Justin having fled. When they return to the commune, it isn't anything like how Justin is presenting. There is a sense of dread that grows though from events like the rope pull with something that isn't seen. Weird pictures and other forms of media show up. There is also something living in the lake that is creepy as well. This all worked for me. Another thing that I want to bring up is the fact that this is a sequel. I've now seen Resolution, which precedes this twice before revisiting this. What we are doing here is taking what is introduced in that movie and then building on it. This includes time loops. We also got Mike Danube (Peter Cilella) and his friend Chris Daniels (Vinny Curran) who were the stars of that movie being brought back. They even interacted with Aaron and Justin which gets brought up again. I loved this easter egg here. I don't think there's more to go into for the story so over to the acting which is great. We get to see the effects on people living in a group like this. Justin and Aaron share stories about how they don't fit into society. They are having trouble connecting with people because of their isolation and upbringing. When they return though, Aaron thrives. The people are much nicer and it is tighter knit. Now Justin knows there isn't something right and he is suspicious which is good. Something else interesting though is a character named Lizzy (Kira Powell). I brought her up because she is a recovering addict and a person like her does well in the structure of a community like this. I'll just say that Moorhead, Benson, Hernandez, Ellington and the rest of the cast fit their characters. They bring them to life. All that is left then to go into would be filmmaking. This isn't working with the biggest budget, but the effects look good. There aren't a lot of them and the ones that are used are done practically from what I could tell. A lot of them I believe are just done with camera angles and using cuts to make it look like someone is not there. There is CGI, but I didn't have issues there. I know the ending and a scene with birds using computers. No issues with either of those though. I'll credit the cinematography as well as the framing. The sound design of the film I was also a fan of. That along with the soundtrack used fit what was needed to build that growing scene of dread. It also factors in giving more of the story as well. In conclusion, I thought this did interesting things that pique my attention. I love the concept. Two guys escaping from a cult only to go back when their lives aren't working as they hoped. I love the background idea of a Lovecraftian type entity manipulating things as well as time loops. I do feel that they ran out of steam during the third act and it loses itself a bit. No where near enough to ruin this. The acting though was good as well as the effects. Not one that I think will be for everyone. If what I said works for you, then I'd say watch this. It takes what Resolution does well and just builds on that. My Rating: 8 out of 10.",1070,1,1,True

The only real problems come from a lack of budget - there isn't really a 'big scene' to pivot the movie around and the visual effects are perhaps a little too simple/subtle to satisfy mainstream audiences.

The acting was really good. Honestly, I was quite surprised at how good the filmmakers acting was. If you are a sci fi lover, then watch this film. It makes you think....I actually had a nightmare about it (in a ""good""way). So it has the mind bending aspect but also the thriller aspect to it. Very appealing. Now for some spoilers and issues. So, we learn as we watch that the ""cult"" and others in the area, that they are stuck in a time loop - that some sort of power or alien/diety sort of thing is controlling it. And in some cases, he is cruel (and we don't know why) and in other cases not so cruel, but still disturbing. The cult has to live over and over again within this time loop, never aging, never changing, never able to leave. Issues - How did these men, when they were boys leave the ""cult?"" There was some dialogue regarding age and being able to see or feel the diety....does this mean they weren't affected as kids? Is this why they were allowed to leave 10 years before? Why didn't these guys realize something else was going on when the people in the cult didn't age? Aarron and Justin weren't young enough to play ""boys"" 10 years old too. Took some imagination and thoughts that Justin was just going gray early. ................Also, the leader/not leader guy (Hal) says that they make beer and that is their livelihood and that a couple is the one who grew the barley. Well how, if they are stuck in a loop, able to grow barley, harvest it, process it, and ferment beer in that time. Also the leader/not leader gets angry with the Aaron and Justin for the lies Justin tells about the ""cult"", saying that it ruins their livelihood of selling beer....well how in the bleep are they selling beer to the outside world? no one can leave, right? so are they saying that people come there, buy their beer, then leave? it doesn't make sense. It's not logical and has too many unanswered questions. There are also unanswered questions with how long they were there? how did they age in a time loop as boys? They were pulled out of a burning crash (mother died - was she in the cult or leaving the cult or just a traveler?). Again, how did Justin get them out of that cult? How did they not know about this evil deity? Did they not see and were they not part of the time loop? had they never explored the area as kids? Did they never see the totem poles? And WHY did the leader/Hal tell Justin to go to the bottom of the lake? Why didn't anyone in the cult WARN them about what was really going on? Why didn't the lady with the missing husband say WHY they couldn't look for her husband? So many questions.....as others have said. But OVERALL, a really interesting, thought provoking story which was well filmed and acted. Definitely worth your time and attention. These guys remind me a bit of my favorite film maker. M.

The exceptions mostly end up becoming cult classics, but from my experience - this is the general tendency. But the whole concept of this movie sounded so interesting that I decided to give it a shot, despite the fact that I wasn't much of a fan of the people who made it (and played the lead roles in it). Let me start with this - I understand why the rating is as low as it is. This movie is called a horror movie in most of the places I've checked, but the horror crowd will be disappointed by its lack of scares (none, in my opinion, though my wife was spooked on several occasions). Also, the low budget can be seen in several scenes and in the age of the superhero movies that come down to style with little to no substance, the small imperfections can drive some people away. Not me, though. Even though the cameras were obviously not the most expensive ones, the long shots of this movie were nothing short of amazing. However, this is the kind of movie in which we have to count on a lot more than the visuals, and my God does it deliver. I will not tell the story in order to avoid spoiling it, but it's all there: the characters, the plot, the twisted fates, the script, the humor, the resolution, the meaning... It's a great story told in a spectacular manner. When something as good as this has such a low rating, you kind of expect them to mess it up with the ending, but the ending was probably one of the stronger parts of the movie, without too much ambiguity, but enough for it to be debated. Unfortunately, there isn't too many people to debate with. Let's hope that will change.",318,1,3,False

Hell it escaped the loop from indie film fest to indie film fest to find itself on a DVD shelf in my local library, but maybe that is a case for de-volution. I enjoyed this the way, you might enjoy showing up early to watch your local high school basketball game and seeing the JV squad out there really competing. Maybe some hackneyed dialog and play calls, cheap fouls and uniforms, but nonetheless everyone really striving. That labor of love vibe is what came through to me more than a fully realized story. It was interesting to hear the filmmakers talk about how the seed for the story came from a more jokey previous piece, and here it brushes up against horror in the dark, but mostly comes up with a lite creepiness. That and mix in a smattering of red pill/blue pill. For what it's worth I did look up ""arcadia"" (not the CA town) and read about the concept to designate a place of rustic innocence and simple, quiet pleasure. Possible spoiler, is this the only way a commune can not succeed with such simple, quiet pleasure and everyone doing their joyous thing, is to be propped up by some malevolent force. I guess we'll find out in Solano County when Flannery Associates create their California Forever loop-utopia.

However, what I got was a (rather too) slow fiction story, with an original script and idea, with very decent acting and ... a soul. It also had one of the best cosmic horror vibes in a film I've seen in years. It's there, it's subtle, no one says ""Chtlhu"" or show any type of monster, but it's all implied. Now for the bad. There are a lot of plot logic holes that are tiny, yet they take you out of the story. I don't want to spoil anything now, just keep an open mind and remember that this film is probably done with a few million dollars at best. Then there is the pacing. There was NO REASON to have this film have almost two hours. A shrewd editor could have done more with less and cut at least 20 minutes and make it feel snappier, also avoid some of the logical holes. Funny enough, I watched an episode of Daredevil: Born Again right after this, also executively produced by Justin Benson. He also worked on Synchronic, another interesting low budget sci-fi.

If you went in there and did a completely blind pick of a movie, chances are, it's gonna be crap. But buried within the loads of cheaply made (and acted) horror movies are some real gems (thankfully, you can usually tell which ones are total schlock by the covers). That's where I found The Resolution, and it just felt so odd because it's such a great film. I've read that The Endless is a ""somewhat sequel"" to that... But in my opinion, you MUST watch that first to fully understand the movie, not just the ""shared scenes with characters from The Resolution"". There's a weird symbiosis between the two because you can't fully understand the events of one without seeing the other, so I recommend watching them back to back. The Endless feels much larger in scope than the first film. The Resolution is to Alien, what The Endless is to Aliens... The first film does an amazing job of feeling very claustrophobic, with most of the off-putting and disturbing events happening in a cabin or RV, and even using tight angle shots when outside. The Endless seems more expansive in scope, and you really feel the vast emptiness of the desert setting. Benson and Moorehead are brilliant directors in a way I've never seen before because you really feel the exact breadth of the occurrences that they want in each film... The Resolution operates like most horror movies, affecting only the characters on screen. But The Endless operates more akin to some sci-fi movies where the impact of the consequences reach a wider scope. I do believe the directors must have used the first two Alien films as templates for their two related films, because the parallels are so strikingly similar. And much like the Alien franchise, I have to admit that the first film, The Resolution, may be my favorite because I have an affinity for movies where people are stuck in one place the film, and usually have a very tight, close feeling of claustrophobia to them. But since The Endless was created 5 years later, the reality now is that one cannot exist without the other. That's the exact reason why this was more a review for both films together... You cannot have one without the other. To comprehend the entire picture, you have to see both films. The pieces of one movie will seem abstract and confusing, like they were purposely left unanswered, until you see the other. But even then, there are some little tidbits here and there that ARE left intentionally open to interpretation, like so many avant-garde filmmakers tend to do. All in all, these are two of my favorite films. But as I'm writing this and thinking about the shared reality of the two films, it occurred to me that it wasn't until I saw both of them (it was about 3-4 months before I finally sat down to watch The Endless, having read that it served as a quasi-sequel to The Resolution immediately after seeing it) that I realized just how much I love them both, especially The Resolution. The relationship of the two continues to confound me, because I really believe, had I seen The Endless first, I similarly would have had to then watch The Endless to fully appreciate how much I love them both. This is all getting a bit trippy to think about, and considering the common theme of Time as an abstract in both, it's really making me consider just how far the reach of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorehead's genius goes...",605,0,0,False

With its masterful storytelling, compelling characters, and mind-bending plot, The Endless stands as a refreshing and unique addition to the genre. The story revolves around two brothers, Justin and Aaron (played by the directors themselves), who escaped from a mysterious cult a decade ago. Despite leaving, they remain haunted by their experiences and the uncertain circumstances surrounding the cult's beliefs. When they receive a cryptic video message from their former cult members, they decide to return to the remote campsite, hoping to find closure and answers to the strange occurrences they witnessed in their past. The film's strength lies in its ability to create an unsettling atmosphere from the outset. The isolated setting adds to the film's foreboding tone, as the brothers discover that the campsite is not what they remembered it to be. The directors skillfully play with perception and reality, slowly unraveling the truth behind the cult's beliefs and the unexplainable phenomena that occur in the area. Benson and Moorhead's performances as the two brothers are compelling, bringing authenticity and depth to their complex characters. Their chemistry on screen enhances the emotional resonance of the film, grounding it amidst its otherworldly elements. One of the most impressive aspects of The Endless is its cleverly crafted narrative. The plot builds gradually, leaving breadcrumbs that tease the audience's curiosity and intelligence. As the story unfolds, it challenges the viewers to contemplate the concepts of time, reality, and existence, leading to a mind-bending climax that leaves a lasting impact.

Back home, the pair seem to be in a rut but the younger of the bros feels if he can rekindle the feelings he once had in this sect, maybe he can finally turn his life around. As soon as they arrive, things seem to be going great since their old colleagues greet them w/open arms & encourage them to stay as long as they want (the older brother gives the visit a max of a couple of days) but as they venture out into the land the cult calls home, things seem to be off as the fellow members appear to be in states of arrested development, reliving old conversations & decisions as if they were had moments ago. As their time there starts to dwindle, we see certain areas are besotted w/time pockets whereby some inhabitants time signatures fluctuate between minutes or hours. Whatever is happening appears to consume the entire region so when the brothers are separated (ironically they're looking for each other), they need to focus & escape before they too become mired in these time sinkholes. Letting the mystery grow organically works wonders for this tale which lives in the ambiguous never spelling out what's happening but giving the viewer enough information for them to continue forward (or is it backward?).

My wife is. If I am going to seek out a horror film I go after ALIEN or the like. So it was to celebrate her birthday that I joined her in her hand-picked horror movie marathon. I do like a good space-bending Lovecraftian story when they come by once in a blue moon... and The Endless is a doozy. Is it Sci-Fi? Is it demons? Psychic phenomenon and magic? When it comes to the Lovecraft genre, your guess is as good as mine. We are already conditioned to think of Lovecraft movies from decades past as generally pretty campy and over the top. ""Lovecraft Country"" the TV show brought a lot of Lovecraft elements into the modern world of storytelling. This included making many people aware of the sordid views of the actual person (Lovecraft) himself, despite his epic talents as a psychedelically nocturnal storyteller. Last puzzle pice to help you understand why I gave this 10/10.... SAW, the first movie was made on a shoestring budget, something like 100k if I recall correctly. Yet for all the limited finance the writers of the very first SAW film created a horror masterpiece. Again not my kind of film at all, and yet it was genuinely impressive. The Endless does just as masterful a job as the first SAW movie, creating superb storytelling on a shoestring budget. The concept was so good and so high brow, that I could completely forgive the limited special effects. The brief CGI bits were instead applauded by me for doing their best to give us a glimpse of this incredibly philosophically deep horror story. They did just enough to avoid being one of those ""tell everything but do not show anything"" horrible wastes of time.... and instead The Endless did indeed show us what we needed to see to step into something far beyond reality as we know it, yet let us remain with our feet on the ground. Some people feel The Endless had a few loose ends, but I came away feeling extremely satisfied from a story very, very well told. This is not to mention the fact that an entire cast of unknowns (at least to me) gave excellent, fully immersive and fully believable performances from start to finish. The Endless is truly an underdog masterpiece.

The older Justin (Justin Benson) has vivid and terrible memories of their time with the group, but younger Aaron (Aaron Moorhead)has just hazy memories of pleasant times. So, despite Justin's wishes, the two do in fact return to the compound they left a decade earlier. But why are they being summoned back? Are their lives (again) in danger? Or has the cult changed into just being another Northern California commune? When the brothers arrive in the middle of nowhere, they find the de facto leader Hal (Tate Ellington), who explains that the group has prospered in the years since Aaron and Justin left. Their primary source of income? Homemade beer. Very hipster. The members of the small commune/cult each have their own special skill, whether it's painting, knitting, magic tricks. The list is pretty finite, actually. But it isn't too long before things get a little unsettling. No spoilers here; the cult believes there is an all-powerful deity who exists only for them – i.e., not a God from any other religion. This entity sends the group messages via cassette tapes and Polaroid photos. The group members pass this all off as normal; to be truthful, I found their happiness to be a bit unsettling. But Aaron, the younger/more impressionable of the brothers, wants to believe and is definitely looking for some structure in his life after a decade of menial jobs and no real direction. His wiser brother Justin, is strongly skeptical, but certain events do make him question his own sense of righteousness. So this seems like a pretty straightforward story, doesn't it? Maybe there's something to the cult's thinking, maybe they're really just harmlessly living off the grid. But then a few somethings happen, and the movie switches from being about a crazed cult into being about, well, the neverending loop of reality. And that's when the movie really takes off. I'm talking about mindbending twists and some terrific special effects. Just like that, the plot zooms from just sort of floating about, intriguing but not enticing, and then it blasts into overdrive. And suddenly nothing makes sense, and everything makes sense. It's a huge trip. For that reason, I really enjoyed this movie, the third I saw at this year's Spooky Movie International Film Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland.

A daunting atmosphere is created almost instantly with ominous scoring and dramatic transitions from scene to scene. Tensions rise as the plot carefully creeps along and the cast is given room to hit notes as diverse as comedic and horrifying. However, while the craft of this movie may be clear, the drawbacks are clear as well. Some jokes fall flat, some characters feel incomplete, and some effects look weak. The Endless gives so many gifts but, unfortunately, it delivers some misses as well. Lightly peppered throughout the existential themes and sprawling imagery are cheesy lines and forced plot points, which leaves the whole thing feeling like a slightly missed opportunity.

imdb_the_endless_gavin6942_20170421,The Endless,IMDb,gavin6942,2017-04-21,7,A Defining Film of 2017,"Two brothers return to the cult they fled from years ago to discover that the group's beliefs may be more sane than they once thought. This film is more clever than it first appears, because it operates on at least two levels. On the surface, it is a taut, well-crafted horror story about a (possible) ""death cult"". We have some mysterious rituals, a missing husband, and seemingly silly camp activities that may – or may not – have a darker purpose. Some of this is vaguely alluded to in the opening quote from H. P. Lovecraft, and further still during the lake ""reveal"". The scare quotes here are just because what is revealed at this moment is entirely up to the imaginations of the viewer. A certain Lovecraft story may provide a guide, or it may be merely a coincidence or red herring. But once the big reveal comes, everything goes dark, and the suspense truly becomes horror. The subcutaneous level is focused on a theme: the truth of religion, either this one or religion in general. Though this film really only explores the reality of one (fictional) religion, it does make us wonder: what if some religions we find strange are actually right? With so many religions in the world, it is certainly possible that one or more are correct. And if the strangest ones might be right, we ought to question our own beliefs: do we believe correctly? With so many choices, it is hard to say for sure. Though this deeper meaning may not have been intentional, it nevertheless exists and makes the film even more interesting. The filmmakers previously had a hit with ""Resolution"" (2012), but all signs point to ""The Endless"" being an even bigger success. The film played at Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, and will no doubt be seen by a wider audience throughout 2017.",313,78,50,False

Why isn't his body there from every loop? Shouldn't there be hundreds of corpses? Why aren't anyone else's bodies there from their previous loops? Do people have an awareness of their loop? The cult people seem to. The gun nut tweaker does. But the protagonists don't seem to, despite clues that they are looping. The handcuffed drug addict and his friend talk about knowing about their loop, and yet, when it resets, they seem to carry on repeating their previous loop like their memory has been reset. The guy in the tent with a 10 second loop speaks like he knows he's looping but acts like he doesn't by doing the exact same thing every time. I don't understand the rules. So the monster in the sky has complete control of time, and is omnipresent, but it can only communicate by taking pictures on a polaroid camera?! And why does it leave media in such random locations? Sometimes it's mailed to you, sometimes dropped at your feet, and sometimes delivered to the bottom of a lake. What? Why is the cult so secretive about information regarding their loop while people in other loops aren't secretive about it? They come right out and say it. It seems like they're in a predicament, and they would want to explain it to others and ask for help. And what is the sky monster that controls time?

Very rarely do you feel any genuine emotion from the cast. That said the movie is weird and interesting. Two brothers who ran away from a supposed death cult and live a poverty stricken lifestyle decide to go back to the cult, which for reasons unknown never actually finalized their end, to give the younger brother some closure. As the days pass tension mounts and the brothers begin to think the supernatural is majorly at play and things get...crazy. The movie provides finite closure to ""Resolution"", the writers previous movie which ended on an insane Cabin in the Woods-esque cliff hanger. It does it well and on a whole, while slow and dry, I enjoyed this conclusion.

My main problem: when Justin Benson's character threw down verbally against the cult leader there should have been a tonal change with him that lasted for the remainder of the film. No one would have such an epiphany and verbally blow up at someone about the horrible conditions in that place then just lollygag through the remainder of his escape. Just moments after he decided that he wanted to leave he seemed as indifferent and lethargic as he seemed during the beginning of the film. There was no sense of urgency or anger or even panic in his acting-- normal things that one would expect in those conditions. It might have been a limitation of him directing himself. Aaron Moorehead's performance as his brother was almost as uneven. They seemed to play basically the same people from the start of the film to its ending.

It wasn't what I intended to see when I traveled to the cinemas last month, but it's what I got. I don't have much to say about the actors, or directors, nor their previous films. I simply walked into this movie blind. It's from this perspective that I'll put together my short review. The Endless is a film about time, life and consequences, coupled with supernatural themes and elements. The Endless starts out poorly and awkwardly with obvious low production value, stale acting and a weirdly present shaky cam. The poor impression this put on me harmed the film in the short term, but actually left a lot of room for it to move upwards, and that it did. The film itself decently improves once the plot moves from the characters normal lives and into the isolated country area where the rest of the movie takes place. The plot itself is the movies strongest suit, but that isn't saying much. It delivers decently on tense moments, interesting characters and creative concepts. Throughout the film I had to remain on my toes to stay on top of some of its more convoluted elements, which I'm going to put into the negative category. I honestly believe a film's plot should at least on a surface level be completely graspable in a first watch, with still plenty of underlying points and themes waiting to be discovered later. By and large the film didn't capture my attention for very long and its even taken me a while to get around to writing this review. In summary, the film keeps itself moving on its good pacing and plot, but is constantly brought down by over-complicated elements and stale acting.

I've recommended it to a lot of fellow horror readers, too. I personally feel that the film adaptation falls incredibly short of what it could have been. The novel is beautifully crafted with suspense and character development, whereas the movie offers 2D characters that are simply there just because. Their faces remain blank the majority of the movie and their line delivery is flat and almost always as if they're bored talking. In true Shyamalan fashion, (yes, it's M. Night's daughter who directed it, but the apple doesn't fall far from the tree), the twist is a huge moment. While it does get revealed, it also changes a huge part of the original ending of the book, which makes the overall story even more of a 2D ""horror twist."" The book's ending gave me chills; the movie's ending gave me cliché horror. I will say, I was eager to see who would play the character of Madeline, as she is such a force in the book as the most interesting character, as well as the one who has been trapped in the forest the longest, and Olwen Fouéré portrays her beautifully. The overall set design and atmosphere of the film is also done well, which helps but also makes the movie's poor script and characters feel all the more disappointing at times. While I won't actively encourage not seeing this movie, I DO encourage you to check out the book, by A. M. Shine. I'm also happy that an author whose work I appreciate it getting the attention of Hollywood to have his work made into a different media form - let's hope if his other works become film or television adaptations, that they'll be given the adaptation they deserve.",307,224,40,False

Horror movies that involve a twist on folk stories accompanied with an eerie location usually pair well together and in this case, it does. Ishana Night Shyamalan's directorial debut is one to be proud of. You can clearly see sprinkles of her father's style imbedded in the film but also boasts her own unique vision. In regards to the plot, the story is interesting enough to keep you invested throughout the duration. It reveals just enough to ask questions but not enough to give them away. The design of the ""Watchers"" is the highlight of the film. Without spoiling too much, every time they were on screen I was fully engrossed. Enough was shown of them that made me wanting to see more. The worst unfortunately, are the characters which were one dimensional and lacking realism. They acted in ways no human would in this situation, especially the lead. A good horror movie requires realistic and likeable characters to vouch for. ""The Watchers"" struggled to create such. As most horrors unfortunately do, ""The Watchers"" does have some moments that I found a bit silly. Moments where you ask yourself ""why would she do that"" or ""why did that happen like that"". Such moments didn't help the film. I was skeptical towards the beginning on the film, thinking that it would meander in its plot and ultimately be repetitive. However, as the film progressed and its locations changed it kept the story fresh and wanting more. The ending boarded on lacklustre however, I didn't mind that it didn't get too ridiculous and over the top. Felt more realistic and poignant. Overall, a decent debut film that highlighted a fresh look at folk-lore. The frustrating characters and some silly moments did prevent it from being great. 6.4/10 for me.",306,167,33,False

The actors are good and the cinematography is really good. The setting is spot on and it really gives you a feeling of menace.

Each night they are killed off to be replaced by another 13 next day. Working with no mechanical tools they hand dig a huge pit to house an equally huge bunker that has the viewing platform on top.

When Mina found herself driving down a dirt track that clearly wasn't going anywhere, why didn't she turn around and try to find a new route? What did the people in 'the coop' use for toilet paper? How did they keep themselves clean with no washing facilities? Did they wear the same underwear every day? Did they have plates and cutlery? If Daniel had been there for eight months, how did he keep his hair so short? Where did they all sleep? There was only one bed. And when did they sleep? During the night, when the watchers were spying on them? I thought they had to keep the watchers entertained during the night... Where did Daniel get the huge length of cable needed to connect the camera to the television? And are we expected to believe that the camera came with still functioning batteries? Where did Daniel and Mina get that long length of rope from? If it's possible to successfully hide from the watchers under some branches, why not build such hideouts beyond the points of no return, thus making escape more likely? Who was keeping the generator topped up with fuel? Did no-one question where the power source was hidden? Would a university really leave a professor's room untouched for over thirty years? And as for the building of 'the coop', this made no sense whatsoever. Where did the professor live while it was being built? How did he leave the forest to find more construction workers? Did no-one become suspicious about all of the missing builders? And why did he have the coop fitted with a massive one-way mirror if he was going to spend most of his time in the bunker?

I'm going to try my best not to keep comparing this to M. Night's movies but in particular The Watchers reminded me a lot of The Village and the issues I have with that film and I think I'd still feel that way with or without the familial connection. Because like The Village, The Watchers has a very intriguing hook that presents a lot of interesting story possibilities very early on but it never capitalises on them in any satisfying way. The dialogue is really weak here and it's frequently delivered in extremely wooden ways which most rears its head in the exposition. Because Shyamalan clearly doesn't believe in the less-is-more approach in that she feels the need to over explain everything and as a result the mystery never really feels that intriguing. Most of the reveals come across as very flat that feel like they lack sufficient build up to be satisfying. It's also very repetitive for most of the first 2 acts with it essentially following the same stricture of leaving this house and returning to it before night fall and it just came across as tiring rather tension-building. The reveals don't really feel earned and they're the one thing I wanted the film to explore more but the script really feels like it strikes the worst balance with what it chooses to focus on. The 3rd act was also a pretty big disappointment. The main action that's being built up for the entire film is achieved in a fairly standard way that doesn't feel fitting for what was being set up and it makes the mistake of feeling like it's getting ready to end only to go on for what felt like another 30 minutes. Thankfully what saves the film from being a complete waste of time is the truly impressive filmmaking on display. It's gorgeously shot and visually ambitious in a way that feels like it could only come from a first-time director. I thought the score was phenomenal as was the cinematography in a way that didn't feel like it was drawing too much attention to itself. There are some very effective scares and genuine scenes of tension, unfortunately it was just never sustained enough to keep my interest. It's the script that ultimately sunk this movie for me but it's very clear that Ishana Night Shyamalan has real talent behind the camera. The Watchers was frustrating waste of potential for me and something that never really felt like it capitalised on its intriguing set up. It's just reeks of a script that doesn't trust the intelligence of it's audience and I was just so consistently irritated at how the film kept going out of it's way to explain things in the most clunky and unimaginative ways possible.

When I saw the Shyamalan name attached to this project, I naturally assumed it belonged to M. Night, but this one was directed by his daughter Ishana. The film reminded me a lot of the senior Shyamalan's picture ""The Village"", in as much as the story took place in a secluded location from which there was seemingly no escape. I had to question however, why Mina (Dakota Fanning) kept driving into a forest when the road suddenly turned into a long stretch of grass. Other unexplained anomalies kept popping up as well, such as the appearance of a long rope when it was needed for Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) to lower Mina into the forest burrow. Where did it come from? And if 'The Coop' was originally constructed by a former but now deceased professor investigating a human/fairy symbiosis, was the best viewing material he could have selected been a reality TV program like 'Lair of Love'? All the while after its first introduction into the story, I thought the resolution would have something to do with the guilt felt by Mina for the car crash death of her mother fifteen years prior, but that turned out not to be a determining factor. Instead, we have a randomly selected outcome in which Professor Kilmartin's (John Lynch) wife Madeline (Olwen Fouéré) was discovered to have died years earlier but existed as a transformed human/fairy halfling who also turned out to be one of the titled 'watchers', who presumably kept her human guests captive as part of her own observations. For a venture into the supernatural, this wasn't the worst director Ishana Shyamalan could have done, but it does point to a certain lack of cohesion and continuity when you apply some logic to the story.

imdb_the_watchers_theffachrif_20240702,The Watchers,IMDb,theffachrif,2024-07-02,6,The Watchers are watching.,"Written for the screen & directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, the story follows Mina (Dakota Fanning) a young artist who gets stranded in an expansive, untouched forest in western Ireland. Her attempt to seek help leads her to a group of strangers who seem to be hiding from mysterious creatures lurking in the night. I won't deny the fact that I was very eager to see this movie because to be quite honest, I have a soft spot for the writer-director's father's filmography for maybe a biased reason. It's because some of his movies are ""interesting"" if not good. (It doesn't mean I tolerate 2010's The Last Airbender). Even though he only serves as a producer, it doesn't take away any expectations that it sets, that it's either going to be a solid debut for her or divisive like most of M. Night's work. Anyway, let's just get into it I honestly don't have a problem with the narrative as it's very straightforward and even intriguing. But the ultimate twist in the movie's ending kinda rubs you the wrong way because a simple dialogue doesn't quite justify how that one character behave the way she is from the first act to almost right before the twist. I won't be spoiling anything but you'll know when you've watched it. Another thing that always irritates me and maybe exists in some Horror movies is the characters decision that leads them to their demise just before they're about to escape from something or someone. Which in this one seems even more foolish because the character looks like completely forgot what everything has happened before. Technically, The Watchers is solid with its fine use of colour to contrast the world where humans and the creatures live, although it can be too dark during night time. I do like the subtle camerawork that adds the eeriness of the scene, I guess it runs in the Shyamalan's blood. 6,9/10.",323,25,7,True

Night's daughter learned everything she did about filmmaking from her Dad, although that's not necessarily a compliment. As with most of M Night's films, I don't really review them per se, I just list a bullet point of the most absurd moments, and I figured why not continue this trend with his daughter? First of all, I'd like to point out that nepotism can be a very bad thing, and this film is an example of that. It only exists because of who the director's Dad is, and I guarantee you that someone else (who wasn't ""a name"") could've done more with the budget. -The plot is so ""been there done that"". From the troubled adult with a troubled past who has to deal with supernatural monsters, to the ""ancient beings who were once the friends of mankind"". Every plot piece is a ripoff of a better film that came before it. -Very ""M. Night"" quality of characters. No one says things the way real people do, and way too often people just kind of stand around and stare at each other. I just wanted to yell at the screen and say ""would someone say something? Will someone talk? Would someone say something, anything like a real human would?"" The dialogue was terrible throughout. -A dude points out the monsters ""always come"". Always. Yet near the end of the film when he's just about to escape, he allows himself to die in an incredibly dumb way. The monsters had to be shown killing someone to ""prove"" how deadly they were. I guess? -Notice how often in M. Night-adjacent films there is a scene at / near the climax where something is just so dumb visually you are forced to say out loud ""That was stupid!"" This film definitely contains that moment. -My biggest issue with the film though is that it has about 4 endings. Obviously the director wanted the story to be wrapped up in a certain way, so we clumsily are lead through multiple different ending points to get us there. By the end it's so laughably anticlimactic. Definitely how not to tell a story. The cinematography was decent.

I recognized only one actor, Georgina Campbell, the lead from ""The Barbarian,"" a film I quite enjoyed. I was also eager to see how Ishana Shyamalan's directorial debut would turn out. To start, I think the film was very well directed, featuring some really cool and creepy shots that effectively conveyed the story without relying heavily on dialogue. The initial concept of the creatures was interesting; I assume they are based on a real mythical creature, which adds a nice element of realism to the horror genre. However, that's where the positives end for me. The acting felt mediocre. Despite what I've seen online, I had no issues with the accents, being from the UK and accustomed to Irish accents. The acting, however, often felt forced, and I didn't find the relationships or the characters' dread believable. The only scene with commendable acting involved Georgina Campbell. My main issue with the film is the twist. Without giving away spoilers, I found it incredibly obvious and poorly thought out. It felt like a placeholder from the first draft, something that should have been replaced with a more refined idea. Overall, it's an okay film.

The book is fantastic and the character development, the terror of the antagonists, the plot and twists are so much deeper than what was shown on screen. Of course movies typically pale in comparison to books, but the characters aren't even really the same.

Without spoiling, I can just say that when there doubt, whether with regards to character motivations, the purpose of the Watchers, or how certain supernatural things work, the film was genuinely interesting and fun to watch. Once it started to explain everything, the character motivations, the purpose of the Watchers, and the whole backstory involved, it fell flat.

A girl travels to the forest in Ireland. She ends up getting trapped there and meeting a small group of people that she must join their shelter as there's something in the woods that lurks. This movie was a serious waste of time. Nothing happens. SPOILERS... Nothing happens for almost the entire run time. A small group including Fanning go day in and day out living like robots in the forest. They have to do all their survival stuff during the day because at night creatures come and they must stay in some small weird shelter so they aren't killed. It takes almost the entire movie for them to find a secret door that leads them underground to get some answers. The whole time you're thinking the old lady is one of these creatures. Once they find the underground bunker below the shelter they've been living in for months/years they immediately set off for the only way out of the forest. THIS WAS THE ONLY INTERESTING PART OF THE MOVIE and you had to wait so long to get to it and then it lasts only a couple minutes and they get on a crappy canoe and get to normalicy. Dakota Fanning does a minute of investigating once back in the real world and figures out that the old lady is actually a creature. A small battle ensues then Dakota Fanning gaslights the creature and then everything is ok. The end. The movie is shot very well from all aspects of cinematography. Dakota Fanning does what she can. All other characters suck. Especially the old lady. The movie clearly has a message and some type of folklore but it's not even worth looking into.

Night Shyamalan, steps into the spotlight with her debut film, The Watchers, a suspenseful horror film that's equal parts intriguing and frustrating. Mina (played with quiet intensity by Dakota Fanning), a young artist on a solo trip in Ireland, finds herself stranded in a remote forest with no way out. Seeking refuge, she stumbles upon a concrete bunker where three strangers are already holed up. But safety is a fleeting concept here. As night falls, a mysterious force emerges, forcing the group to huddle behind a large, one-way window-the only barrier between them and the unseen watchers. The film's greatest strength lies in its initial setup. The dense, uncharted forest evokes a sense of primal unease, and the concept of unseen entities lurking just beyond the window is undeniably creepy. Shyamalan keeps the creatures shrouded in shadow for a good portion of the film, relying on suggestion and flickering lights to build tension. This approach is reminiscent of classic monster movies like Alien or Jaws, where the unseen threat is often more terrifying than a fully revealed one. However, The Watchers struggles to maintain its momentum. The plot unfolds slowly, with long stretches of dialogue that do little to develop the characters beyond their basic survival instincts. While Fanning delivers a compelling performance, the supporting cast feels underdeveloped. The film throws in a childhood trauma element for Mina, but it feels tacked on rather than organically woven into the narrative. Visually, the film is a mixed bag. The use of colour is particularly interesting. The stark contrast between the warm, artificial light inside the bunker and the cold, oppressive darkness of the forest effectively creates a sense of isolation and vulnerability. However, some of the CGI effects used for the creatures later in the film feel a bit clunky and detract from the overall atmosphere. The editing is efficient, with jump scares used sparingly and to good effect. The film's ending, a signature Shyamalan twist, is sure to spark discussion. But unlike some of her father's more successful works, it doesn't quite land here. It feels more like a desperate attempt to inject a jolt of surprise rather than a satisfying conclusion to the established themes. The Watchers is a promising debut from Ishana Night Shyamalan. It showcases a clear understanding of suspense-building and a willingness to experiment with genre tropes. But, the underdeveloped characters, a slow pace, and a somewhat underwhelming twist hold the film back from reaching its full potential. If you're a fan of slow-burn horror with a dose of mystery, this might be worth a watch. But if you're expecting a truly terrifying experience, you might want to look elsewhere. It's an intriguing film with a great central premise, but its execution is uneven.",467,53,50,False

This is her directorial debut. Furthermore, the film was produced by her father, director M. Night Shyamalan. When young artist Mina (Dakota Fanning) gets stuck in an unknown forest with car trouble. Here she is told by a woman Madeline (Olwen Fouéré) to come to her quickly, to take shelter in her bunker. Once in the bunker, she hears terrifying noises outside. These sounds come from beings called the Watchers, mysterious beings who emerge to observe the prisoners in the bunker. Anyone who is not in the bunker at night becomes victims of these Watchers. Mina and the other prisoners must now come up with a plan to escape the Watchers during the day, or end up stuck here for the rest of their lives, or become prey to the Watchers themselves. Ishana Shyamalan, just like her father, knows how to build a story and its mystery. However, she now has to learn to make a film more her own. This film is reminiscent of many other films such as The Blair Witch Project, 10 Cloverfield Lane and even the TV series Wayward Pines, on which her father also contributed as director and producer. The story also has some unusual moments, which sometimes makes the film seem vague rather than scary. All the rules that the characters receive in the bunker do not always seem to have been reflected in such detail. Other details can also seem a bit strange and not always everything seems to have been given the same amount of thought. When you do get answers and further details at the end, it sometimes makes the film just more vague than it actually answers all your answers. As a result, the film can sometimes come across as a bit long-winded. The Watcher largely remain mysterious in the film, because they are not shown, or only shown. This way your own imagination plays out when you hear the sounds of the Watchers before they are actually shown to you. In the darkness these creatures look believable, but when they come into the light, the quality and believability of the effects diminish slightly. Their shadow appearance may also be reminiscent of how her father tried to keep the aliens hidden in his films Signs. The acting in the film works, but due to the vague, ill-considered aspects of the story, the actors sometimes come across as if they do not always know exactly what is expected of them or what they have to do. However, they sometimes seem a bit too calm to people who know that they are hiding and being observed by mysterious creatures. Some of the characters are also given too little background to make you as a viewer really care about them.",470,35,15,False

After watching it, I'm baffled by the decision, both by the studio who allowed this, and by her father for starting her career with this absolute pile of garbage. This movie is terrible from beginning to end. Nothing makes sense. The characters constantly explain rules and backstory that also make no sense and feel completely random. Characters change behavior for no reason. They mention that the forest brings out the worst in you, but that never comes into play aside from that one incident. It's also extremely stupid. A couple examples, these people are trapped in a room every night for 8+ months with nothing to do. And yet none of them explored that single room to see if there is anything hidden? How dumb can you be? I'm asking the writers. In another moment, they find a bunch of information which is vital to their situation.

You will be able to tell what I am talking about. The trailer was good not to reveal much (at least for me), that said, the movie is quite packed. And has a main character that we have to put ourselves into - there is not much we get there. We will get some backstory, that is somewhat important to the story and the resolution at the end. This has bits and pieces, some fit perfectly others not so much. There is an entire mythology that this tries to build or force upon us. Doesn't really work entirely though - this feels like it needed a prequel (to better understand things) or we see this as a first part of more movies to come. Maybe then a revisit will make sense. I doubt though that this will have the success that warrants those mechanisms to work and let her do more of these. There is suspense however and for a feature length debut this ain't half bad.

Set in the wilds of Ireland, the film follows a young artist, Mina, who finds herself stranded alongside three strangers in a seemingly endless forest. As night falls, they become increasingly aware of unseen watchers lurking in the darkness. The beauty of ""The Watchers"" lies in its unsettling mood. The vast, silent forest is filmed with a sense of looming dread, and the sparse dialogue only amplifies the feeling of isolation. The mystery of the watchers themselves is also compelling, with hints of a rich mythology that pique the audience's curiosity. However, the film falters in its execution. The pacing can be glacial at times, and the characters, while adequately portrayed, lack the depth needed to fully invest viewers in their fates. The limited scares rely heavily on jump cuts, which may prove predictable for seasoned horror fans. The biggest letdown might be the ending. While Shyamalan attempts to deliver a signature twist, it feels less like a shocking revelation and more like a convenient way to tie up loose ends. It leaves some plot threads unresolved and fails to deliver the full-fledged payoff the built-up tension deserves. Overall, ""The Watchers"" is a visually stunning and atmospheric film with a promising premise. Yet, the slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, and underwhelming twist prevent it from reaching its full potential. It's a decent watch for those who enjoy slow-burn horror with a strong sense of place, but those seeking edge-of-your-seat thrills or a mind-blowing conclusion might be left wanting. Here's a breakdown of the film's strengths and weaknesses: Strengths: Beautiful cinematography, suspenseful atmosphere, intriguing central mystery. Weaknesses: Slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, predictable scares, unsatisfying ending.

The effects were okay when the movie was lowly lit and things were obscure with dark, fog and forest. But at the end, the CGI was really sketchy. Like Van Helsing bad.

Story: An American girl is taking a trip to deliver a bird between two remote places in Ireland. The girl (Dakota Fenning) is socially isolated and do not have real friends and detaches herself from her family. This would cost her since she is stuck in the woods alone. Luckily she finds a shelter with some collection of weirdos that are subjected to some sort of monster-aliens that keeps them in a hut equipped with a large one-side mirror so they can watch them. Kind of a big-brother IRL, only a one that makes close to zero sense.

imdb_the_watchers_nerdbox_dave_20240608,The Watchers,IMDb,nERDbOX_Dave,2024-06-08,2,A Flickering Flame That Fizzles Out,"""The Watchers"" starts with all the hallmarks of a classic Shyamalan slow-burn: a moody atmosphere, cryptic characters, and a lingering sense of unease. Unfortunately, that unease eventually curdles into frustration as the film descends into a predictable twist and a blatant attempt to launch a franchise. The initial premise - a group of strangers trapped in a remote location stalked by unseen creatures - holds promise. The slow reveal of the characters' secrets and the growing tension within the cabin are mildly intriguing. But the film takes an agonizingly long time to get to the point. The dialogue is riddled with exposition dumps, and the scares rely more on jump cuts than genuine dread. Then comes the twist. If you've seen even a handful of M Night Shyamalan films, his daughter follows the same formula and you'll likely predict it a mile away. It's a familiar trope delivered with a thud, leaving you feeling like you've been cheated of your time, only with a different coat of paint. The final act doubles down on the disappointment. Instead of a satisfying conclusion, we get a clumsy setup for a sequel. ""The Watchers"" is a frustrating watch, a flickering flame that promises warmth but ultimately sputters out. It serves as a reminder that familiar tricks don't always translate into compelling cinema and that you can take a nap during the film, wake up, and not be lost.",235,22,12,False

Night Shyamalan (producing), it looked worthwhile from the trailer but I read it was receiving mixed reviews from critics. Basically, in Galway, Ireland, American immigrant Mina (Dakota Fanning) works in a pet shop; she has struggled with guilt for fifteen years after distracting her mother (Siobhan Hewlett) while driving, inadvertently causing her a car accident that killed her. This accident caused her to become estranged from her twin sister Lucy. One day, Mina is tasked with delivering a valuable parrot to a zoo in Belfast. After getting lost on the way, her car breaks down, and she is stuck in the middle of the forest. She tries calling for help but cannot get a phone signal, and when she takes the parrot, naming it Darwin, trying to find help, she ends up going in circles. Mina notices an old woman in the woods; following her she finds a bunker-like building, nicknamed 'The Coop'. The old Irish woman, Madeline (Olwen Fouéré), introduces herself and brings her inside, where she meets two other occupants, Ciara (Georgina Campbell) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan). Madeline explains that there are mysterious creatures called 'The Watchers' watching them from outside the other side of a one-way mirror window every night. Madeline explains there are rules to follow: the Watchers will kill anyone outside the shelter at night, they must never open the door to anyone outside during the night, and they must never enter the Burrows. The group has been stranded in the forest for several months without seeing a Watcher; Madeline claims that the sight of a Watcher will be enough to kill them. The only things to do in the Coop are talk to each other, draw, read, and watch a DVD of the reality dating show ""The Lair of Love"" repetitively. Ciara tells Mina that her husband John (Alistair Brammer) left the Coop days ago but has not returned. The group can leave the shelter during the daytime, which lasts only a few hours, to venture out for food and attempt to find a way out of the forest. Mina convinces Daniel to explore the Burrow, the subterranean tunnels where the Watchers retreat during the day because of their aversion to sunlight. Being sure to stay in the light from above and the torch, in the cavern below, Mina finds several items, including a camcorder before narrowly escaping a Watcher. That night, John is heard knocking and calling outside the Coop but Madeline refuses to let him in. Mina has set up the camcorder to capture a Watcher, and the group insists ""John"" shows himself on camera. When ""John"" fails to verify himself to Ciara, he appears to be dragged away. The Watchers crack the mirror and Madeline berates them for breaking a rule. The following day, Madeline returns the items to the Burrow to appease the Watchers. As winter falls, the group begins to turn hostile against each other. In a moment of madness, Daniel locks Mina and Madeline out of the Coop at night, forcing them to hide in an improvised den in the forest. They witness the Watchers, humanoid creatures that imitate and can transform into the Coop's occupants. The creatures react angrily to Madeline and Mina's absence. The pair return to the Coop and Madeline explains that the Watchers are shapeshifting Fairies trying to learn to mimic humans. The group notices a hidden door under the carpet of the Coop. They escape through it before the Watchers attack; at the bottom of a ladder, they find an underground study. On an old desk computer, Mina plays a series of video diaries of Professor Rory Kilmartin (John Lynch), the Coop's creator. Kilmartin came to the forest to study the creatures and managed to capture one of them, bonding with it. In his last entry, the despondent professor explains how to escape from the forest, following the flight of any birds above them. The video ends with him requesting that his research be destroyed and climbing the ladder back into the Coop to kill the captured Watcher and himself. The group spends what might be their last night alive, with Ciara and Daniel dancing to ""Young Hearts Run Free"" by Candi Staton, and Mina telling Madeline about what happened to her mother. The next day, the group follows the professor's directions, along with tree markers they made, and they use Darwin and other birds to guide them to the river at the edge of the forest. On the way, after finding a stone marker, Madeline explains that the Watchers are Fairies, who were deprived of their wings, driven underground, and imprisoned in the forest, and humans have warred against them for a long time. The group is forced to run as it gets dark, but they reach the river and the professor's boat in time. But Daniel falls behind and is killed by the Watchers. Mina, Madeline, and Ciara get into the boat, realising that the creatures cannot swim, and they are shocked to see a Watcher mimicking John, and another transforming into Daniel. Mina heads to the professor's university to destroy his notes. She discovers that humans and fairies once lived in harmony, with some even mating and producing hybrid offspring that could withstand daylight. Then she shows Ciara photographs revealing that Madeline was the professor's late wife. Madeline is the Watcher the professor captured and eventually transformed into her. But Ciara is revealed to be a disguised Madeline when the real Ciara arrives. Madeline changes her form, knocking out Ciara and attacking Mina. Madeline tells them she was an outcast among the Watchers because she could go out in daylight, and she plans to kill and replace Mina. Mina reveals Madeline's status as a half-human hybrid, persuading her to let go of her hatred towards humans, and that there may be others like her. Madeline sprouts wings and leaves. Later, Mina reconciles with Lucy. Meanwhile, Madeline, in the form of a human child, keeps watch over Mina.

Ó Meallaigh as the voice of a Watcher. The performances of Fanning, Fouéré, Lynch, and the others are alright, the script is clunky, the scares are meagre and dull, the plot is patchy, and the twists (like father, like daughter) don't really work, the only good thing was the spooky score by Abel Korzeniowski, otherwise, it was a dull, disappointing, and only just watchable supernatural horror.

imdb_the_watchers_journey_with_a_cinephile_20240623,The Watchers,IMDb,Journey_with_a_Cinephile,2024-06-23,7,"Solid Adaptation, but Missing Aspects to Come Together","This was a movie that I believe went onto my radar when looking at Georgina Campbell from her earlier film Barbarian. As this came closer to coming out, I saw part of a trailer at the theater. What caught my attention was that this was written and directed by Ishana Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night. It stars Dakota Fanning and Olwen Fouéré as well. I saw this opening night at the theater. Synopsis: a young artist gets stranded in an extensive, immaculate forest in western Ireland. After finding shelter, she becomes trapped alongside three strangers, stalked by mysterious creatures each night. We start this off with John (Alistair Brammer) as he's running through the woods. He checks his watch when he comes to a marker saying, 'Point of No Return'. It also has a number under it. He runs past, but gets frustrated when despite going forward, he somehow doubled back to that marker. He tries to climb a tree and ends up falling. There's something in the woods after him. It then shifts over to Mina (Dakota Fanning). She works at a pet shop. We see that she is a talented artist and she is also troubled. We get more of that as we go on. She is ignoring calls from her sister. She is asked by her boss to take a rare bird to a zoo. It is a day's drive and he thinks that she needs time away, to which she agrees. She runs into an issue though when she is driving through the thick woods from the synopsis. Her car dies suddenly. She sees a marker like the one that John saw. She believes that someone must live close by. She takes the bird and seeks their help. When she gets too far from her car, it disappears. That's when she meets Madeline (Fouéré). She tells her to follow, but she must hurry. There's something in the woods after her. They make it to a building. It looks to be made of concrete. One side has a mirror. This is a one-way glass where something outside can see in. Staying there with Madeline is Ciara (Campbell) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan). Ciara is married to John and she is waiting for him to come back. This group has been living here for a stretch. There is something different about these woods. It prevents them from leaving. There is also something that watches them through the window. They must stand in front of it each night or it upsets whatever watches them. There are rules here. Do not go outside after dark, stay to the light and avoid these large holes that lead to tunnels underneath the ground. Something to include here, Mina has a troubled past that she won't forgive herself for. Her defiant nature might be what they need to get free of their curse. It also could spell their doom. That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I'll then start is that I didn't realize until the end that this is a based off a book. I'm intrigued to check that out, because there seems to be rich mythology here. To build on that, I guessed what the creature was going to be the moment I saw the giant holes. I'll be cryptic here to not spoil it, but it is something that is being used more lately in cinema. I do like aspects that are built in to build atmosphere and tension. Now that I have those opening thoughts there, let me delve more into this one. Since I haven't read the source material, I'm not sure how much of this is from the book and how much is something that Shyamalan did. What is intriguing is that this feels in the same vein as something her father would do. There's a fairy tale feel to what we're getting here. It feels like it is still in our world. I got vibes of something like The Village in that, we have this group that is forced to live in isolation while the outside world moves like normal. Trapping our characters in this structure in the woods is good. How big this forest is adding to the isolation. This builds up a good atmosphere. Then adding in the supernatural helps there as well. Another thing that it feels like it is borrowed from other Shyamalan films is the broken lead. We learn that Mina was ornery as a child. This led to a tragedy with their mother. She still harbors that guilt. She isolates herself from her sister who wants her to let it go and move on. That would be something difficult to do, but that healing needs to happen. Bringing back up mythology, it is said in the beginning that this forest calls to people who are broken so I like that. It almost seems like fate is guiding her to come here and trapping her. Fanning's performance does well in bringing the character to life. It is subdued. I think what she did was good, but it's not my favorite thing I've seen her in. She almost seems to be sleepwalking through the role. I don't know if I can fault her though as that seems to be by design. Let me then complete my thoughts on the mythology. I love that Madeline knows about this place. She even knows more than she is letting on. This causes Daniel to attack her at one point. There is also Kilmartin (John Lynch), who is a professor. He built this place. What is great there is that it builds on what we know in the start. The deeper our characters figure this out, the more nefarious things are. What I'll say is that there's a reveal here that I guessed the moment another room is found. Even though I did, I like that from there, it starts to become characters not trusting each other. This plays into what our 'watchers' are. It also makes sense as to why they come and that this one-way mirror was used. It makes it even more terrifying. Since I've already brought up my thoughts on Fanning's performance, let me delve into the supporting cast. Campbell was good in her limited role. She is there to almost entice Daniel now that John is missing since the younger man has a crush on her. Ciara also plays in when it seems that John is still alive. Fouéré was good in her role. She comes off as wicked the deeper we go into learning the truth here. Finnegan was fine in his role. They bring up his back-story, but I don't know if it amounts to much unfortunately. I like Lynch's role to help fill in more history. Brammer works as a catalyst. I also would say that Siobhan Hewlett, Hannah and Emily Dargan. They help develop Mina and her story which works. I'd say that for the most part, the acting fits what was needed. All that is left then is filmmaking. I thought that the cinematography and framing were good. How they set up these woods, that isolated feel and with how distorting being that deep can be. I'd even say that the look of the creatures were good. They keep them mostly to the shadows, which is a strong move. When we do see them, they're done with CGI. I don't think it looks great. We also don't get a great look at them so it works. Like I've said, I thought that this built a good atmosphere. Being trapped in the woods and something preventing you from escaping. There seems to be magic or a curse trapping them. Then you have monsters which is terrifying. The sound design works there, hearing the creatures scream and then attacking the structure inside. This was one of the stronger aspects for sure. In conclusion, I thought that this was a fine movie. There are good aspects to it. The mythology that this story builds on being one. Another is trapping our group of characters deep in the forest. Where it then goes as they try to escape was fine. The problem is that I feel there is more to this than what we get and it was just missing something to fully come together for me. I did find my interest waning a bit. Fanning was fine as the lead. I personally thought that she was asked to play the character this way and the supporting cast was a bit stronger. This is made well-enough with the cinematography, framing and sound design leading the way. What I'll say is that I think this would be a good gateway horror film for sure. I do think it is still worth a watch as well. My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",1475,3,2,False

You can see that Ishana Shyamalan has had some incredible influence on her in her formative years, because this film is very well made. It's beautiful to look at and the way some of the shots are created is nothing short of masterful. The problem with this film lies in the absurd story. I understand it was based on a book, and I can kind of see it working in book form because when you have to imagine something like this yourself your brain naturally does it in a way that makes sense to you. However, seeing someone else's version of it in movie form is a hard pill to swallow. And for that reason it was hard to ever take the film all that seriously. I tried to buy into it, I really did, but it just wasn't feasible. So I was never scared for these characters and I wasn't intrigued by where the story would go. It didn't leave me with a lot left to grasp onto. Still, for a debut film effort this is better than most and there is a lot of promise here.

Not perfect but I liked it,"You can tell there's a good idea buried in the excessively twisty mess that is The Watchers. Unfortunately, Ishana Shyamalan didn't stop at the good idea and kept adding more and more and more, making it a movie that extracts too much from a concept that could have been better if the brakes were applied. Also, yes, you can see the twists coming a mile away......... Much like one of those infomercials where some loud person says, ""BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!"" The Watchers give too much from too little. Interesting premise, but it's buried under the horrible writing..... Again, Irish folklore can be great, as long as it's the right storyteller. Ishana Shyamalan is not the right storyteller. Much like her father, she doesn't know when to stop with the twists, and instead turns what could have been a good film into a predictable mess. Aside from the transparency in plot, there are far too many moments where characters state the obvious, with too many plot points forcibly glued together rather than naturally woven into each other. Pacing was also all over the place, with a majority of segments feeling rushed. I haven't read the book by A. M. Shine (yet), but I will definitely have to at some point. I didn't hate the CGI. In fact, the use of shadows made the CGI more enjoyable. The Watchers look scary enough in their night scenes and there's effort made to make them somewhat faithful to the lore they're based on. Plus the cinematography takes advantage of the foggy forestry to generate tension. There are also instances where intense scenes aren't shot right, ruining the moments just enough that the payoff isn't there..... The acting is good enough. Dakota Fanning is more than competent at playing an American running from her troubles, while Olwen Fouéré always churns out a good role in a horror film. Georgina Campbell and Oliver Finnegan are also compelling enough in their performances that you get a sense of the despair, shock, and anger they go through..... The soundtrack hits all the right points for spooky and suspenseful fair, with a heavy emphasis on violins. The noises made by The Watchers feels right for their behavior and movements, and there are many scenes where the sound effects hit just right. Again, The Watchers could have been a good film, if it was not directed and written by Ishana. Unfortunately, this is a mess, with a predictable story and a lack of actual substance.

imdb_the_watchers_m_sileo_20241112,The Watchers,IMDb,m-sileo,2024-11-12,8,Great,"The Watchers is a film deeply influenced by gothic and fantastic traditions, merging these genres with Slavic mythological elements to create an internal universe that reflects a theme of female darkness, possibly lost or hidden. The character dynamics mirror those found in Dracula with characters named Mina and Lucy, referencing the duality of femininity-Mina represents the moral, restrained woman, while Lucy embodies passionate, unrestrained darkness. The film also explores themes of identity and duality, drawing on the rich tradition of Slavic mythology, where female figures, often connected to death, the underworld, and transformation, play central roles. This includes deities like Kali, Persephone, and Rusalka, all of whom embody liminal spaces between life and death, similar to the vampire mythos. The narrative weaves these ideas through the conflict of human-fairy wars and the notion of transcendent beings whose powers are cut off from the world, much like the fate of the fairies. The film follows the story of Mina discovering Madeleine's divine, hybrid nature, leading to the ""awakening"" of her wings, both literally and symbolically, and the reconciliation between the two characters. The film's characters, particularly Madeleine, resonate with the figure of Baba Yaga from Slavic folklore-an old, ambiguous figure who straddles light and dark, life and death, further emphasizing the thematic connection to transformation and the cycles of life, death, and rebirth. In its exploration of these complex themes, The Watchers reflects on the return of a lost, transcendent power through the female experience, portraying a journey of self-realization and reconciliation, with a darker, yet ultimately hopeful resolution.",258,5,4,False

But somehow the ending and the antagonists and monster reveal make all expectation loss. The movie prologue is excellent the camera tries to keep a scene where Mina is watching by something like a fashion doll or people in the street or when someone is talking to her the face is covered like she is talking to a mirror as well as the bathroom scene. An appetizer for the main story. Although an element of the problematic main character didn't fully deliver it makes Mina look like just a normal teenager. The Forrest introduction is just a missing poster in a gas station and a random guy getting caught by something the only thing that makes this introduction a gimmick is that the forest is unescapable due to it acting like a maze and having low visibility. The mirage thing is trying to deliver the Mina trauma and the back story doesn't work out as it should be The story and character design are built very poorly there is too much back story of each that has to be delivered and the movie loses its focus on the main character, Mina's story just appears late in the shelter and her drawing habit is just there for the sake of continuity of the movie it doesn't contribute to her personality. Her backstory is fully explained and used only for the final arc which they already escape the forest, idk why the movie has to build it so long from the beginning just to use it only in the final and it doesn't deliver impact that much, feeling like it a kid cartoon when protagonist changes antagonism mind to become a better person. Ciara is just a side character with poor development nothing crucial about her. Daniel has very high expectations of his development love story and his belief, that he has high screen time to shine but Ishana's writing at its finest strikes again. Madeline is supposed to be an unexpected twist on the final arc but there are so many loopholes in the story that just make her story not make sense making the impact low. The Monster is scary when it does not appear. It doesn't mean that the costume design and story are not good but before we can see it the movie tells us that you cannot see this thing or maybe it don't want to be seen. This makes it very mysterious and scary but the reveal just makes this monster become just a violent creature that can't exposed to light, killing all expectations built before.",444,2,1,True

Like Father like Daughter but I didn't really cared that much and here's why is low rating expectations. Ishana Night Shyamalan's directorial debut, is a film that attempts to weave a tapestry of suspense and horror but ultimately falls short of its ambitious mark. Based on the novel by A. M. Shine, the film sets its story in the haunting backdrop of an expansive Irish forest, where the protagonist, Mina, played with a certain detachment by Dakota Fanning, finds herself stranded and subsequently trapped in a mysterious bunker known as ""The Coop."" The premise promises a chilling blend of psychological terror and survival drama, as Mina and her fellow captives are subjected to the nightly scrutiny of the enigmatic watchers-otherworldly entities that demand adherence to a strict set of rules. The concept of being observed as a form of captivity is intriguing, yet the execution lacks the depth and tension required to elevate it beyond mere surface-level frights. Shyamalan's vision is evident in the film's attempt to balance the fantastical with the horrific, but the result is a disjointed narrative that struggles to find its identity. The dialogue often veers into the realm of the vapid, failing to provide the characters with the necessary substance to engage the audience fully. Moreover, the film's commitment to its genre is wavering, leaving viewers in a limbo between a child-friendly spook and a genuine horror experience. The cinematography captures the eerie beauty of the Irish wilderness, but the film's aesthetic choices do not compensate for its narrative shortcomings. The watchers, intended to be the source of terror, lack the palpable menace needed to instill genuine fear. The film teeters on the edge of a dark fairy tale and a thriller but lacks the conviction to either fully. In conclusion, ""The Watchers"" is a film that reaches for the stars but ultimately gets lost in the woods. It's a tepid entry into the Shyamalan legacy that will leave audiences yearning for the suspenseful storytelling that once defined the family name. While it may find a niche audience appreciative of its attempt at a new take on the horror genre, it fails to deliver the gripping and cohesive narrative that its premise promises.",379,12,6,False

That being said, the story was very predictable, the ending was a missed opportunity being by far the weakest part of the film. The story made little sense. It's not that I got hung up on the details of what the Fae are, it's that they were portrayed both as intelligent creatures and brutal predatory animals. There are a lot of relatively new books that deal with that in a much more consistent and captivating way (see The Call, by. Peadar ó Guilín, for example). And then there are the characters: inconsistent, only fleshed out right before they needed to elicit an emotional response and so on. I can't even say that the direction was bad. I didn't mind it or the editing. So maybe Shyamalan's daughter has what it takes already as a director. It's the story that was the huge letdown, so maybe she's not as good of a writer.

Much more satisfying to be in the middle of watching than to get to the end and try to reconcile the experiences of the characters with the explanations of the characters. The ominous tone of the villains relies so heavily on the nameless/faceless fear, that when all is said and done and fully explained, there are still no actual pinpointed villains and that was very disappointing. Basing the entire conflict of the film on interspecies dividedness would work much better if it became the center of the story for more than about a minute and a half and if we were actually able to hear and/or see what happened. Instead, it's all theorized and delivered in dialogue by a character who turns out to be rather sinister and unreliable themselves, but their lines about the folktales don't have the impact they need to. Despite being told the reason behind the anger between the humans and the non-human Watchers, it gets zero screen time- not even an imaginary sequence. It feels far too rushed to be a red herring or a detour; it just falls very flat. Perhaps I missed something, but the biggest logistical failure of this movie comes down to wondering: if the faeries hate humans for taking away their wings (which we are told but never shown), what do they get out of studying humans in hopes of becoming them? Since they are also flightless as humans, why do they want to take human form? It would make more sense if the main conflict in the folklore underpinning the entire story had been that they were outcast by human society for looking or acting different from humans. And in return, they capture humans to study and become them so they can finally be included. The Watchers seems like a story that wanted to be three separate movies in one. While following the story through the characters' eyes in this way is engaging at the time and keeps the pace moving along swiftly, it's just so unfocused and convoluted by the end that it doesn't feel like there's a satisfying end. It seems like there is a lack of continuity and logic involved (see also: Hereditary) when comparing the plotline of what happens on screen and the underlying story they end up trying to tell you was happening all along.",414,5,1,True

I went into this film with tempered expectations, as I always do with Shyamalan films. But this one gripped me a bit more than the others I've seen in the past. I loved the concept of Celtic mythology being the root of the horror mechanism for this story. Not many films in general ever touch Celtic or Celtic mythological themes unless it's for a period piece. So, in that respect, this movie was very refreshing for the thriller/horror genre. Woods horror is something that always encapsulates the entirety of my focus whenever it's on screen. I believe this is due to my irrational fear of the woods. This project was akin to other woods horror movies that got my blood pumping and my anxiety levels rising, such as The Blair Witch Project and The Ritual. The shots in the woods were very well done, especially the scene where Mina and Madeline are hiding in the rotted tree looking back at the coop as the fae start to roll in to watch. The movie had moments, especially in the beginning when Mina was talking to herself/the bird, that felt forced and fell really flat. Some of the acting from both Mina and Daniel took me out of the scene, making me think the delivery really could have been better, or the lines written to be stronger. The pacing was also very off. By the end of act two, which I originally thought to be act three, we see our trio of survivors finally escaping the woods with the watchers stuck on the shoreline. But where most people, including myself, expect there to be a short, maybe 5-10 minute epilogue to cap off the movie, there was a whole other act. The third act felt dragged out and slow, other than the final standoff between Mina and Madeline, which I also had some issues with. Summarily, I enjoyed the movie. I am willing to rewatch at some point in the future, as a lot of the movie and its concepts were something I found intriguing and heart-pounding. But it didn't hit like I wanted it to.

The audience, and all characters in the scene can very much see that it is a door. But those bits of dialogue become standard past the one-hour mark. Beyond that, there are so many plot holes that could've been solved by even one session of conversation with a single other person before starting pre-production that it's not even funny. ""The fae lost their wings"" but they also happen to be shapeshifters? So, what's stopping them from, stop me if I'm not making any sense, shapeshifting into fae with wings? Oh, right, nothing.... And our protagonist, why exactly does she suddenly care about this mysterious professor's work, enough to go out of her way, WAY out of her way, to go to his university, where somehow his office, more than a decade later, was preserved perfectly intact, completely untouched, for absolutely no reason. No actually university would allow this, the room would be repurposed in a heartbeat, especially at an establishment in such old buildings. Moreover, how did this coupe get built? We're meant to believe that a team of people came to and from the city by a small boat, or literally any boat at all, and wandered into the woods where electronics can't otherwise work without a generator, and just built this thing? Unless this professor was the richest man in the world, this wouldn't be remotely possible to build, especially not the bunker. The hole was dug out with what excavator? The excavator that fit on the small boat, that was taken through the unkempt woods, that was driven down the long road? Oh right, sure. And, even with all that, exactly how did this team of people, who can't be there at night get, day after day, to and from this build sight? Of course, on the small boat, in the 90s, without anyone ever finding out about these fae. Those are just a small fraction of the endless illogical hoops this film jumps through to justify its plot.

When the owner of the shop assigns her to deliver a yellow parrot in Belfast, Mina uses the GPS to drive through a lonely road. Out of the blue, her car stops working and Mina looks for help. When she returns, she does not find her car anymore and enters the forest completely lost. When the night is coming, a strange woman, Madeline (Olwen Fouéré), asks her to run to her house called ""The Coop"", otherwise she will die. Mina meets Ciara (Georgina Campbell), whose husband John (Alistair Brammer) is looking for help trying to leave the forest, and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) that are stranded in the forest for a long time. Georgina explains rules that must be followed by Mina and tells her that the beings ""The Watchers"" observe them though a mirrored glass in the bunker and kill anyone that leaves the bunker during the night. But Mina breaks one rule with the support of Daniel and enters in an underground tunnel, irritating the Watchers. Some time later, Mina learns from Madeline that the Watchers are Fairies trying to learn how shapeshift to imitate humans. When they break in the Coop, Mina finds a hidden hatch leading to another bunker where Professor Rory Kilmartin (John Lynch), who constructed the Coop, researched the Fairies and they learn more about the Watchers through his computer files. Will they succeed to escape? ""The Watchers"" (2024) is a supernatural movie with an intriguing beginning and terrible development and conclusion. The plot is flawed, with many unanswered questions, like for example why Mina proceeded following a weird route instead of returning to another road. Or how Dr. Kilmartin built the bunker and the Coop? The explanation that he brought poor people to work in the forest is not plausible. Or how people in the Coop washed or changed clothing. Or how they drink water. Or how they have haircut and Daniel shaved himself. How a university let a stranger enter the room of a professor to collect his research. It seems that the gorgeous Dakota Fanning when she was a young girl has become a woman with plain beauty. It also seems that Ishana Shyamalan has the same genetic problems in direction inherited from her father. My vote is five. Title (Brazil): ""Os Observadores"" (""The Watchers"")",431,8,3,False

And in this movie director Night Shamalans show us a combine elements of horror, fantasy, psychological tension that showcase this film. The overall story centre about main protagonist Mina who struggle with her pust life. And she tried to overcome. Who becomes stranded in a dense, remote forest in western Ireland. As she searches for a way out, she stumbles upon three mysterious strangers-Ciara (Georgina Campbell), Madeline (Olwen Fouéré), and Daniel (Ruairi O'Connor)-who have been trapped in the forest for years. They are constantly being watched by unseen creatures, forcing them to remain in the confines of their forest prison. In my opinion the film well created suspense and thrilling are mind-blowing. Dakota Fanning delivers a compelling performance as Mina, portraying a mix of vulnerability and determination. Georgina Campbell is equally impressive as Ciara, a character whose fear and desperation are palpable. Ruairi O'Connor brings a quiet intensity to Daniel, while Olwen Fouéré's Madeline adds a layer of mystery and foreboding to the group dynamic. The main part of the movie is ""The Twist"" Where Mina know about the Madeline. Madeline is a wife of professor, But the twist is she is die over the years and that Madeline she shaw in bunker who helps her she is the one one of Watchers. And this is best scene for my angel. Overall, The Watchers (2024) is a haunting and visually captivating film that will appeal to fans of psychological horror and those who appreciate a slow-burn narrative. Ishana Night Shyamalan proves herself as a director with a strong voice, delivering a film that is both chilling and reflective.

After finding shelter, she becomes trapped alongside three strangers, stalked by mysterious creatures each night, ""The Watchers"". There are rules to follow in these dark woodlands and the concrete bunker and harsh consequences if you break the rules.

You can't see them, but they can see you. If you want a dark, claustrophobic, fantasy, horror, mystery and thriller movie then this might be your jam. The typical Shyamalam twist (just like her daddy's signature trait) ending is predictable and not as terrifying as I was hoping for.

Now I wish I really was.,"The moment they introduce us to other characters besides Dakota Fanning's character Mina, you knew from the jump that the elder white haired Madeline was a villain. There is such little artistry or nuance to her reveal as one of the faeries that it's offensive how long it takes for the movie to make the turn happen. For the longest time, despite not being credited, I was almost certain that Ishana Shyamalan (director of this movie and daughter of famed M Night Shyamalan) wrote the basic story for The Happening. After this movie, I can't be convinced she had nothing to do with it. Dakota Fanning and Georgina Campbell are top tier actresses and they are absolutely wasted in this film the same way Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are wasted in The Happening. As bad as the story, dialogue, and filmmaking are, I have to wonder if these actresses have gambling debts that needed immediate payment. ""Oh, you're such a hater mindlessly saying this movie is badly made,"" Ishana would likely reply if she came from a family that took feedback. So let me drop bricks on this argument her friends in the media will make as surrogates to her nepotistic chicanery. From the first shot of Mina in the Irish pet store until she makes her way into the special cabin in the woods, Ishana does this attempt at being clever by making all of the characters besides Mina out of focus or obscured. This is supposed to illustrate that she's disconnected from the people in the world around her. But Ishana doesn't know how to tell a story without people explaining the narrative (Brian Duffield's Nobody Will Save You managed to tell an entire film without dialogue), Mina doesn't shut up even when she's alone. So instead of looking detached from society because of the grief and guilt she feels, the audience gets this jarring visual that breaks immersion where they're wondering why the people are blurry if she's talking to them. I didn't have expectations of this movie going in. I didn't hear any word of mouth or look at reviews. I saw a movie poster at the local Regal Theater and decided to give it a watch. It was a terrible maiden voyage for Ishana Shyamalan but because of who her father is, she'll keep getting chances where other directors would be less insurable. And don't get me wrong: her father lasting long enough to make the production company that made this film and the already incompetent ""Longlegs,"" it's one of those things that never should have happened. His last great film was Unbreakable and there's an entire generation of high schoolers born well after that film came out.

It really captures that spooky, ""what is happening here?"" atmosphere. Unfortunately, Shyamalan misinterprets too many plot and character beats for The Watchers to be a great film. For a very basic overview, The Watchers tells the story of Mina (Dakota Fanning), a young woman who finds herself trapped in a seemingly inescapable woods. She stumbles upon the trio of Madeline (Olwen Fouere), Ciara (Georgina Campbell), and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) who profess knowledge of Watchers-their captors who view them through a one-way mirror every night and make escape impossible. But Mina doesn't necessarily buy the rhetoric sight unseen and begins her own investigations into what exactly might be transpiring. Atmospherically, The Watchers is really solid. The younger Shyamalan pulls you into the mystery of the piece by parceling out interesting reveals and intriguing creatures much like her notoriously similar father. Investment in the characters and overall plot is not the issue here. What happens at a certain point, however, is that The Watchers must of course declare what sort of film it is. Is it a literal film or is it a metaphor film? I won't spoil that declaration here, only to say that once it does declare a direction the necessary character-development needed to support the conclusion is not present. When all is said and done, this is a film draped in plot but one that really relies on the character relationships to work in the end, and I don't think Shyamalan achieves that mixture with much success. Overall, The Watchers is the type of filmmaking I really enjoy but specifically not the best of the thriller genre.

You barley ""see"" anything worth while or anything remotely horror like & when you do, it's not exactly the pay off of the year if you know what I mean.

Ishana Night Shyamalan, yes the daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, makes her directorial debut with The Watchers. Proud dad Manoj has made the strangest films in the past and even managed to win 2 Oscars with them. He stayed on as producer of the film and his daughter Ishana adapted the book of the same name by A. M. Shine into a movie and it is now in theaters. In the leading role we see Dakota Fanning, who started acting at a very young age. You know her from films such as I Am Sam, War of the Worlds and later she also played the role of Jane in the Twilight films. The rest of the cast may be less known to the general public, but that often works best. When I saw the trailer I immediately got the feeling that this film could be good, because it had such a mystical setting and it all looked quite strange, something I can usually really appreciate. Still, that was really disappointing, because the film is indeed strange, but I really got the feeling I also got with films like The Village and Lady in the Water. I should maybe watch The Village again, but I know that this film did not appeal to me at all. The use of color and especially the style in the film have been copied one on one from Dad's films and Ishana would have been a little more pleased if they created their own identity and did not blindly adopt Dad's style. The first part of the film is of course a bit of exploring and seeing where it will take you. Mina works at a pet store where she is not really happy in a very boring Irish village. She packs the car, takes a bird with her and heads off to a piece of woods where at one point her car breaks down in an X-Files-esque manner. Ok, you might think it's exciting. She then comes to a mysterious sign that marks a point of no return and then a boring part of the film begins and the interest slowly fades away. When she suddenly comes out of nowhere to a house, where she is let in, the whole thing only starts to become vaguer, especially when they are eventually watched by strange creatures in front of a large mirrored window. A kind of supernatural Big Brother, so to speak. The creatures only come at night and during the day you have to run around through the woods looking for food and of course exploring the area. They can't go past the signs, because if you go past them you'll never be able to get in in time before dark and the creatures are quite murderous. You can immediately see that the film is cinematographically well put together and that Ishana delivers a professional job in terms of style and setting, but the concept of the film is simply ridiculous and goes nowhere. Perhaps the book will be better (or not of course), that's all possible, but I haven't read the book and didn't really plan to, especially after seeing this movie. The use of color, the camera angles, the environment, the cast, the film actually has everything except the story. Because at a certain point it becomes clear what the beings are and what the purpose of the beings is, but even then I was like ""what the..."", it just doesn't make any sense at all and the final denouement was in my look even more ridiculous. The Watchers is a skillfully made film with beautiful camera work and beautiful use of color, but the story is just too ridiculous for words and just makes no sense at all. At the beginning you will still appreciate the mysticism, but the further you get into the film, the more boring and uninteresting the film becomes. The debut of M. Night Shyamalan's daughter is good in terms of craftsmanship, but it really deserved a better script. Despite this film, Ishana Night Shyamalan is a name I will look forward to, because everyone can start in a minor key and everyone makes a bad film sometimes, I mean, just look at her father who plays dragons in films like Lady in the Water delivered, but if he delivered a good film, then it was immediately really good and in that respect the same may well happen with this newcomer.

""The Watchers"" is the first film brought to us by M. Night's daughter, Ishana Night Shyamalan, in her directorial debut...and as such, it really wasn't that bad. It features a 30-year-old Dakota Fanning in the lead role, an actress who's been fairly quiet as of late, though we did see her more recently in the third Equalizer movie and in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. It was good to see Dakota taking up most of the limelight again, though it wasn't her best performance. Even so, I did enjoy this movie. Our story catches up with Mina, a young woman who is coping with the death of her mother. She is given a job to deliver a bird, a golden conure, to a zoo. On the way there, her car breaks down in the middle of a forest. But not just any forest. This forest is rumored to swallow up the souls of anyone foolish enough to enter there, nobody having ever returned from it. On foot, carrying the bird in a cage, and alone in the dark, she feels something is stalking her, so she runs until she comes across a building ... and inside are three people who tell her to enter before it's too late. Once inside, events unfold that she could never explain if she had to. I felt that for a first effort, Ishana showed great promise as a director, following in her father's footsteps. She has obviously done her homework - it is well paced, the story unfolding perfectly with us, as the viewers, left in the dark until it was appropriate to uncover each new clue as they came up. She gives us a nice twist at the end. Just like so many of her father's films, and it is a payoff that is worth it. There is always a creepiness and unsettled feeling permeating every scene, and it holds the movie together well. The problem with this film was in the performances. I honestly was very disappointed in the acting. Dakota Fanning just didn't really seem to be invested in her role. Listening to her dialogue, she wasn't given much to work with, I'll give her that, but she still didn't sell it to me. The supporting actors were perfunctory. I thought the story idea was a great one. I feel that Ishana Night Shyamalan did her job, but she could've gotten more out of her cast. I did enjoy it overall though. I'd watch it again.

Just like the faeries in the film itself. How meta! Don't be fooled, though. THE WATCHERS may look interesting and is indeed well shot and produced, but the substance of it is a failure of fairy-tale proportions and a prime example of good old nepotism. Any no-name first time director would have failed to get this film financed, rightfully so. Made from what seems to be a bad first draft of something that might have some interesting core idea behind it, THE WATCHERS mostly delivers clumsy directing with poor pacing, bad timing and badly contrived dialogue - decently acted, though. Too much of what we watch doesn't make any sense whatsoever: how is it possible that you never noticed a huge metal trap door under some thin rug? Where does the electric power come from? Where did the long rope come from they use to go down into the faerie hole? How come a battery from an old camera is still charged? If faeries kill every human, who was able to mate and create the halfling? How did the halfling not know of the bunker when she was right there, as proven by the videos? Why did the dumb male (whose hair was too short for the time he had been caught there) suddenly believe the faerie's deception in the end - just to get killed and create some sense of danger? How did the forest make a car disappear and get everyone confused, except when they followed a parrot that for some reason didn't just fly away? These are just questions from the top of my head, and I'm sure that if you would look for more plot holes, you'd find one almost every minute of this fantastically idiotic film. Just like the two main characters who hide under some twigs and don't get noticed by the faeries, this heap of dung hides itself under some twigs of pretense and won't get noticed by those who mimic intelligence.

imdb_the_watchers_bored_animator35_20240718,The Watchers,IMDb,Bored_Animator35,2024-07-18,8,Intriguing Folk Mythology and Suspenseful Storytelling,"""The Watchers"" is a captivating blend of folk mythology and suspense, reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"". The film masterfully weaves a tale of moral complexity, human nature, and reconciliation. The plot centers around Mina, an American expatriate in Galway, Ireland, who, while delivering a parrot named Darwin to a zoo, becomes stranded in a forest. She encounters a group of survivors in a bunker-like structure known as ""The Coop"", where they must adhere to strict rules to avoid the deadly Watchers, mysterious entities that observe them each night. The film's strength lies in its exploration of human nature in a microcosm, showcasing both the best and worst of humanity. This is beautifully contrasted with the fairies' mistrust and hatred towards humans, adding depth to the story. Acts of kindness, trust, and love ultimately bridge the gap between the species, highlighting the true complexity of humans. The cast was brilliantly selected, with each actor bringing a unique personality to their role. Dakota Fanning shines as Mina/Lucy, portraying Mina's rebellious nature, arrogance, and drive to escape and question authority. Georgina Campbell as Ciara delivers a compliant and sweet character, missing her partner and yearning for his return. Olwen Fouéré as Madeline embodies a sage, matriarchal figure with strict protective instincts and a hidden secret. Oliver Finnegan's portrayal of Daniel captures his impulsive, childlike innocence, adding another layer of depth to the group dynamics. The twist revealing Madeline as a half-human hybrid was brilliantly executed and added a surprising layer to the narrative. The film also excels in creating suspense, using the forest's interplay of light and dark to evoke a sense of claustrophobia and tension. The decision to keep the Watchers' appearances hidden until the right moment significantly heightened their mystique and fear factor. Contrary to my positive experience, ""The Watchers"" received largely negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, only 32% of 168 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The consensus reads: ""Heavy on eerie mood but undone by an obtuse script, The Watchers can only hold the gaze for so long before tedium sets in."" Metacritic assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, indicating ""mixed or average"" reviews. Audience reactions were also tepid, with CinemaScore giving it an average grade of ""C-"" and PostTrak reporting a 55% overall positive score. Several critics compared the director's style unfavorably to her father, M. Night Shyamalan. Dylan Roth of The Observer described it as ""a pale imitation of her father's patented style,"" while Bob Strauss of the San Francisco Chronicle noted an ""inelegant blend of Celtic folklore thriller and contemporary horror movie tropes."" In a mixed review, Katie Rife of AV Club acknowledged the promise but also the problems typical of a debut film. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune, however, praised the film's visual atmosphere, and Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV found enough immersive elements to make ""sizeable chunks of the film watchable.""

I walked into this movie blind. I didn't know it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan's daughter. I don't know if that would have changed my expectations any, but it's probably for the best. I probably would have had a set of expectations that would be difficult to dispel. The first thing that struck me about The Watchers is that the forest looks great. Some of the shots are quite beautiful. It makes you wonder if Ireland is really that stunning or if every Irish movie is cheating and using some kind of Irish supercomputer to enhance every shot through AI. When the movie isn't in the forest, things kind of break down. Olwen Fouéré, who plays a professor who has been trapped in the forest the longest, is good. The rest of the characters are either a bit boring or don't really get a chance to become interesting. At least they're not annoying. The directing seemed pretty good to me, but I think it would be best if the Shyamalans stopped writing screenplays. If they stuck to directing and then collaborated with talented writers, I think many of the problems with their movies would disappear. Or they would at least be muted. There are just so many times you shake your head during this movie. You can let it go and enjoy the silliness, but if you're going to have your characters act like this, why not make it an overt fairy tale? People don't expect logic or believable characters from fairy tales. If you decide to go the modern route, the modern elements have to be believable. People are willing to accept magical realism, urban fantasy, and similar genres because the parts that aren't magical make sense. If you're going to throw everything out the window, make your protagonist a princess who lives in an enchanted forest. Probably fun for undemanding audiences, especially teens.

However, the film falls short of its aspirations, failing to maintain the intrigue and suspense established in its first half. The premise is intriguing: a group of strangers, including protagonist Mina (Dakota Fanning), find themselves trapped in a mysterious forest, observed by nocturnal creatures known as the Watchers. The unknown nature of these creatures creates a sense of fear and tension, as both the characters and the audience know very little about them. The first half of the film effectively utilizes this unknown factor, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats as they try to unravel the mystery surrounding the Watchers.

The second half fails to capitalize on the initial suspense, opting instead for a more conventional and less effective approach to storytelling. The Watchers are revealed to be less mysterious and more mundane, and the film loses its grip on the audience's attention. The film's tone and narrative style, reminiscent of ""Black Mirror"" and ""Lore,"" are not consistently maintained throughout the film. While the first half shows promise with its mysterious atmosphere and thought-provoking themes, the second half falls flat, leaving the audience with a sense of disappointment.

This movie is directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, the daughter of renowned filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan. This cinematic lineage showed itself in very exciting ways. I really enjoyed the homage she paid to her father's style of layered plot twists. It's a good way to build her credibility in his shadow before she can go off on her own and make other culturally rich films without the pressure of living up to his name. Speaking of culturally rich films, I found it fascinating that she used international folklore and the historical context that comes with Irish tales to build her story rather than Western horror tropes. The unfamiliarity with this topic made it hard to guess what was coming next and didn't make the supernatural elements feel forced. Overall, Ishana proved herself capable of complex storylines that sustain tension and give simmering conclusions.

He actually had two other movies that didn't do well at all before his big hit. This comes to mind when watching his daughter Ishana's debut, The Watchers. It's a fine start, though she might be following a bit too closely in her father's footsteps with a reliance on unnatural dialogue and a shocking twist. The Watchers leans more into creepy vibes than outright scares. It won't haunt your dreams, but it'll definitely give you the chills. Personally, I dug the Twilight-esque color grading; it added a cool vibe to the movie. However, the excessive ADR felt slapped together, and there were some glaring continuity errors with people and objects moving between shots. The first quarter of the movie is genuinely tense, with mysterious creatures lurking in the shadows and eerie sounds coming from the forest, creating some solid suspense. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie could've been trimmed without losing anything important. It often feels like it's going in circles, repeating the same stuff without pushing the plot forward. Despite all of the red herrings and elaborate setup, there's little payoff by the end. I didn't find the initial reveal as disappointing as others did, though the CGI looks dated, like a 2015 video game. The inclusion of Irish folklore is cool, but the movie grinds to a halt for lengthy exposition several times. This would've been unbearable if not for the strong performances by the cast. Unfortunately the script is filled with unnatural dialogue. While this might add to the creepy atmosphere, it sometimes made me chuckle at the silliness. The 25-minute epilogue could have easily been condensed into the third act, as it drags the movie out unnecessarily. While the movie starts strong with great tension-building, it eventually loses steam due to thin characters and dumb decisions. It's frustrating when characters forget crucial info just to serve the plot. Ishana has potential and could soar with better material, but this movie isn't quite there. In a year with horrors like Imaginary, Night Swim, and a dreadful Strangers remake, The Watchers is far from the worst, but it's not among the best either.",367,4,1,False

That's why it was thrilling to root for Ishana Shyamalan to follow in her father's footsteps on her directorial debut in 'The Watchers.' Unfortunately (and perhaps unsurprisingly), Ishana's attempt at connecting with audiences with an Irish fairytale failed spectacularly, matching the more recent streak her father has had behind the camera compared to his white-hot early days. To be fair, the younger Shyamalan isn't fully to blame for the shortcomings of 'Watchers.' The film suffers on several fronts, most obviously the writing and screenplay. There is no real chemistry that is created between the cast, with Dakota Fanning's Mina being hardly someone who people want to pull for. The limited cast means dialogue must be that much stronger, and there is a lack of sense of fear or danger that is to be expected for a film in this genre. The ""twist"" is also seen coming from a mile away, which may be less of the fault of the director and has more to do with the fact that audiences are so used to deciphering the clues that are strewn across these 100-minute ""fright fests.""

It had some great moments-both scary and thrilling. The director definitely nailed the mystery, no doubt about that. 2. I liked the main character, and as an actress, she's really talented, if you ask me. She's fantastic and has been ever since Man on Fire (2004). The rest of the cast felt a bit like typical M.

This movie did not take its time and was in no way delicate. The absolutely roller coaster of a plot was jammed into an hour and fourty seven minutes. No time was taken on anythhing of true substance. It was as if M. Night was just trying to paste scenes from a book on screen, while cramming in a wild storyline. AS a result, the plot is cheesy and rushed developing mostly through forced dialogue. The charecters are severely under devloped, there is a struggle to really like any of them because no time is taken to develop them. The relationships... were not even forced, just curiously appeared out of thin air. The real problem here is the intricate plot was just driven too hard and too fast.

Perhaps a new foray into traditional supernatural fables for Shyamalan, there is plenty to like. Whether it be the never-ending eerie, atmospheric and mysteriously haunting forrest the protagonists find themselves entombed within, or the intriguing plot that develops into a group of strangers finding sanctity from the initially veiled creatures that hunt them at night in a glass fronted building - we discover that this is by design, these creatures observe our protagonists through this glass for reasons initially unknown. Unsettling in the extreme. But, unsettling is as far is it gets in terms of horror - I constantly felt intrigued but never scared, which is by no means criticism - it held my interest throughout but never grew into a shock and awe terror spree that it sometimes threatened. The imagery is strong, acting performances excellent, and the music blends well in adding to the tension - but i couldn't help but feel the music should have been more in keeping with the stories Irish heritage. There's so much fabulous eerie Irish music out there, yet not one melody made the cut. I love Shyamalan's work, good and bad, but the final act is where this fell on its face for me. With large shifts in the storyline, twists that didn't quite hit the mark and resolutions that I feel were not warranted, it left me wanting a little bit less story and a little bit more freight. If you're on the fence, I would recommend watching this - it reminds me of birdbox in the vulnerability of the characters in their setting, with a sprinkle of slenderman trying to catch them.

The movie's strong points ends here. Unfortunately, the script and character development is very uneven. While some characters like Ciara and Daniel are well played and developed, the protagonist Mina, played by Dakota Fanning, is a poorly developed character, an unpleasant person, who, despite having a sad story to tell, cannot harnesse the necessary empathy from the audience. Her constant expression of ""screw the world"" means that when you watch it, you're rooting more for her to get screwed than for her to do well.

The woods are getting a bad rap. You'd be better off in a movie saying you're going to Fallujah than saying you're going to the woods. In ""The Watchers,"" Mina (Dakota Fanning) goes venturing into the woods of Ireland for a getaway. If we're being honest, she had no business there in the first place. The road she was driving on ceased being a road miles ago so she was going to be in trouble even with something as simple as a flat tire. Once she reached a certain point the car shut off and her phone went haywire. That should've been warning enough that things weren't right, but she decided to walk deeper into the woods in search of help. What she found was that she was utterly lost, to the point she even lost the location of her car. Fortunately, she was rescued by a woman named Madeline (Olwen Fouere) just in the nick of time. Madeline took her to a concrete structure where she locked a heavy duty steel door just before the loud croaking and screeching got closer. There, Madeline introduced Mina to Ciara (pronounced Kee-ra (Georgina Campbell)) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan). They told Mina to face the glass, which looked like a large mirror from their vantage point. The next day Mina set out, again in search of a way out. After spending the whole day roaming around the forest and getting lost again, it was explained to Mina that they couldn't leave. The forest was confusing and by nightfall the ""Watchers"" would kill anyone not safely in the building with the big panoramic two-way mirror to be ogled by some creatures.

This is based on an Irish horror novel, written for the screen by the director. As I haven't read the novel, I'm unsure if I can blame the filmmaker for some of the shortcomings.

Including a scene with looking at video files on a computer (just like in M Night's ""Split""... not exactly ground breaking). One of my biggest gripes is the complete lack of showing passage of time. They're stuck in this cabin, food is scarce. They must forage and hunt for whatever they can. The only scene they show them eating meat is when one guy kills a crow. Yet none of them look gaunt, scrawny or weak.

I was quite curious about this movie because I am a fan of M. Night's early work, from the Sixth Sense to Signs. I can even enjoy some of his later films for just how crazy they could be. Plus, the trailer intrigued me. The film has an interesting premise of several people in a house in the middle of the forest being watched by unknown entities. It reminds me of movies like The Witch (2016), The Village, Cube, or The Blair Witch Project. Since its M. Night's daughter directing, I was curious as to how it would be. Unfortunately, it falls more towards M. Night's later movies, than his golden years, in terms of quality. Now, this movie is not terrible by any means. It's got a decent atmosphere to it. The acting is fine. I will say, the first half is fairly strong with the mystery of who is watching our lead characters. However, once the mystery is unraveled it becomes a very different movie, and a far less interesting one. It really reminds me of movies like The Village, The Happening, or Old by Shamalan. The problem with Shamalan's movies is that he has very interesting premises, but almost always fails in executing them properly. This movie does that as well. With a movie with a premise like this, less is more. It would have been better if we never got a real explanation of what the watchers were. We can have the characters theorize, but never give a genuine answer. One of the reasons why The Village and the Happening failed is because they tried to explain the mystery, when it would have been better not to. Sadly, I would prefer to watch those movies over this one. To be fair, The Watchers is objectively a better movie than those two. The acting is better, it's more tonally consistent, and there is an actual attempt at character development. However, those two movies left more of an impact on me than The Watchers. The Blair Witch Project does this very well. It never definitively says whether it was a witch tormenting the lead characters, or just some psycho in the woods.

Night Shyamalan (Jury President of the Berlinale 2022), Ishana Shyamalan has developed a preference for mystery thrillers with horror elements. The local anchoring of the events in the vicinity of the beautiful Irish city of Galway is very interesting. The rather monosyllabic American Mina (Dakota Fanning) works in an animal shop in Galway. One day she receives the order to bring a certain parapet (a Schelm, who does not think of the actress Tippi Hedren from the film The Birds by Alfred Hitchcock!) To a zoo at Belfast. On the way she is in the forest of Connemara. Not everything is right there. Mina gets to a strange group around the determining Madeline (very good: Olwen Fouere), which lives in a box with a panoramic window (in the interior as a mirror) and is observed every night by eerie creatures (The Watchers!). Unlike the Naive Ciara (Georgina Campbell) and the inexperienced Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), Mina, who is plagued by a dark family secret, rebel against these living conditions ... A typical Shyamalan! What is real, what is faked? Are there really monsters outside the box? Or is everything just manipulation? Or maybe a parabola on the big brother monitoring shows on television that has been successful for two decades? The film is good that he actually plays near Galway and was also shot there. The Irish horror author A. M. Shine, who wrote the template, is a graduate from the University of Galway. And the forest in the Connemara National Park plays the actual leading role in this film. In terms of atmosphere, the young director Shyamalan does all sorts of things right. However, the character drawing is still expandable. But that is by no means due to the excellent actors. The Irish actress Olwen Fouere (born in 1954) in particular does her job very well and is something of a discovery. The young actor Alistair Brammer can still be seen in a supporting role. And there is a ""found footage"" again with John Lynch, whom you know from the Irish Cannes classic Cal from 1984 (silver palm for co-star Helen Mirren). The film is certainly not suitable for every audience, but it is highly recommended for complete Shyamalan and Galway fans!",386,3,3,False
imdb_the_watchers_natewatchescoolmovies_20240630,The Watchers,IMDb,NateWatchesCoolMovies,2024-06-30,4,This ain't it,"M. Night Shymalan's daughter has made a horror movie of her own and the question arises, does the talent run in the family? The answer is unfortunately a ""no"" that yearns to be a ""sort of"" in the case of The Watchers. A muddled blend of Irish fairy folklore and wilderness escape room intrigue, it stars Dakota Fanning (always reliable) as a girl who gets lost in the woods while on a UK trip and ends up trapped in a mysterious building that her fellow captors dib ""the coop,"" but it looks less like a coop and more like a fancy-shmancy woodland AirBnb property. Every night they are visited by Watchers, mysterious entities that pose a vague threat that steadily grows as Fanning breaks every rule in the book trying to get to the bottom of their situation, and escape. It's a shame because the cinematography here is beautiful, all hazily lit auburn strokes and dense forest, like an adult version of those awesome Spiderwick book illustrations. It's the story that suffers from being an unimaginative retread of other flicks that presented the material better, and it's not even remotely scary for a second. Fanning does her best and others in the supporting cast like horror vets Olwen Fouéré (Mandy, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and Georgina Campbell (Barbarian) try to support her but the script lets all of them down. Around the halfway mark the action drastically shifts, the story loses all anchor point and goes flying untethered to the wind, a narrative lost in incoherence. I was so looking forward to seeing Fannjng in her own 'cabin in the woods' style horror flick but this one just misses the mark in most aspects.",283,5,2,False
imdb_the_watchers_jaredkjacoby_20240608,The Watchers,IMDb,jaredkjacoby,2024-06-08,6,"Great Atmosphere, but Choppy Third Act","Mina is a young artist who is struggling to connect to her sister after the death of their mother. Mina finds herself lost in the woods in Ireland. She ends up in an isolated trailer with three strangers who have been trapped there for months. The four are observed by strange creatures called the Watchers. If they want to live, they must follow their rules at all times including staying in the shelter at night. I have no knowledge of the novel this movie is based on. I went in blind, but optimistic. The trailers looked really interesting and I was curious to see what Ishana Night Shyamalan would bring to the table being the daughter of M. Night. How does The Watchers fare as her directorial debut? Let's start with the good. The Watchers has a lot going for it. First of all, the movie has some really creepy and eerie atmosphere as if you are being watched by an unknown entity. Ishana Night Shyamalan does a great job of creating fear of the unknown force because any scene where the presence of the Watchers are felt is nerve wracking. The story does take advantage of the premise and sets up an interesting world with rules that make the movie feel claustrophobic. Imagine being trapped in that tiny shelter for so long... that kind of horror scares me because this not a movie about death. It is about isolation, illusion and mind games with the Watchers. It also has a theme of regret with Mina's past. It is surprisingly effective and sad when it comes into play as regret drives Mina to become a better friend and ally to the others. The story is pretty interesting for the most part and it has a lot of tension and eerie atmosphere. I like the world-building here. Ishana sets up an area where the four being watched must play by the rules of the Watchers. They have rules the four are supposed follow all the time or they could end up dead. My favorite rule is that they have to face the mirror at all times because that is where the Watchers view them. The rules feel strict and limiting and makes for an unsettling experience as the four have to stay alert at all times. I like that though because it makes the situation feel like there is no room for error and that it would break someone eventually. This is the kind of world that builds the fear of suffering and the unknown. The performances are really good. Dakota Fanning is the standout as Mina who starts off as a stoic woman trying to be rebellious, but becomes a loyal and caring person by the end. She has a few unlikable moments, but her backstory is pretty sad and her development into a compassionate friend to the others is believable. It helps that Fanning is great with both the dialogue delivery and the emotional expressions here. Also, I love that Mina watches a reality show while she is in the shelter. It is a fun trait to see as a fan of competitive reality shows and it kind of shows that Mina may feel more alone than she lets on. Mina is not an unforgettable protagonist, but I did like her more than I thought I would. Olwen Fouéré is great as Madeline who acts as a mother figure towards the others. She is pretty interesting and a lot more caring than I expected her to be. Fouéré gives the character depth with her sweet and angry moments. She also has the most interesting twist of the characters and Fouéré is great in those moments. Oliver Finnegan as Daniel shows a surprising amount of range. He is full of fun and wit at first, but he has a rebellious side that shows some animosity he built and Finnegan shows this side of the character well. I feel Georgina Campbell got the shaft compared to the other three as Kira. Campbell does her best with what she has and she has a few emotional moments and her character's dancing is endearing, but I do feel that her character could have been given more depth. The cast is overall good and they help make their characters more sympathetic and likable. Visually, the movie looks beautiful. The cinematography is gorgeous with plenty of striking shots that help build the creepy atmosphere of the film. The opening scene is shrouded in fog in the forest and it puts viewer in the position of someone stuck in the forest with feeling of being watched and hunted. It is a great opening scene that shows the viewer the creepy atmosphere and how dangerous the creatures are here. One of the best shots involves one with the POV of Mina and Madeline hiding underneath the branches while they get a glimpse of the entities that watch them every night. This is a genuinely scary moment in the film both visually and narratively. The Watchers look pretty menacing, especially when we see their shadows and just parts of them. The way they sound and move is very freaky too. The sound design is pretty good too. The sounds that the Watchers make reminds me a lot about the monsters in A Quiet Place. Ishana Night Shyamalan's direction is very strong as she understands how to make a movie look and feel creepy. The setting is simple, but effective for this kind of horror film. The forest creates several of the scarier moments in the film including the opening scene with the ominous fog and trip down the hole the creatures live in. I love the little shelter they live in, especially the giant mirror which helps create even more striking shots. The musical score by Abel Korzeniowski is very impressive adding to the creepy factor of the movie while sounding memorable and fantastical on its own. Okay, I have been praising a lot of aspects of this movie, but the biggest issue with this movie is the third act. I feel that as a writer, Ishana bit off more than she could chew with the twists, exposition and lore. I think the first two thirds of The Watchers are great with a lot of tension, an eerie atmosphere of the unknown watching them and solid pacing that never drags. Unfortunately, the last third is where most of the movies problems come to play. It has too many reveals and it almost feels like a bit of a tonal change from horror to fantasy. The pacing is also much slower by this point. As for the ending, I like the idea of what Ishana is going for, but it feels weird after the whole movie built up to be. I do not think it is as bad as some people are saying as I do think there are still some good ideas and it does develop Mina's character in a positive way, but it definitely dragged the movie down. The Watchers is a mixed bag. I really enjoyed the first two thirds with the atmosphere, visuals, characters and claustrophobia. There are some very intense and imaginative scenes. The movie unfortunately goes off the rails in its overstuffed third act. Still, I overall liked the movie because what works here I really liked. With her directorial debut, Ishana Night Shyamalan shows a lot of skill in creating a creepy atmosphere and a hearty amount of passion for filmmaking. I hope she continues to work with her craft because with this, I think she has the potential to become a great director. The best moments in this movie reflect that.",1280,3,3,False

I recently had the pleasure of watching a movie that, despite its low ratings, left me on the edge of my seat and begging for more. The film, a masterclass in suspense and horror, is a shining example of how a well-crafted narrative can transcend mediocre ratings and speak directly to individual tastes. From the opening scene, it's clear that this movie is something special. The atmosphere is tense and foreboding, setting the tone for a thrilling ride that never lets up. The cinematography is stunning, using shadows and lighting to create an eerie sense of unease that permeates every frame. The plot is cleverly constructed, weaving together multiple storylines and characters in a way that feels both complex and cohesive. The pacing is expertly handled, ratcheting up the tension to almost unbearable levels as the story hurtles towards its climax. But what truly sets this movie apart is its sense of horror. This isn't just a cheap thrill ride; it's a thoughtful exploration of fear and its effects on the human psyche. The characters are well-developed and relatable, making their terror feel authentic and palpable. Despite its low ratings, I found myself completely absorbed in the world of this film. The performances are top-notch, with standout moments from the entire cast. The score perfectly complements the on-screen action, adding to the overall sense of unease and tension. One of the things that impresses me most about this movie is its ability to balance horror and suspense. It's not just a jump-scare fest; it's a carefully crafted narrative that uses tension and atmosphere to keep you on edge. If you're a fan of horror and thriller movies, do yourself a favor and seek this one out. It may not have gotten the recognition it deserves from critics and audiences, but it's a hidden gem that's well worth watching. Don't let the ratings fool you - this movie is a must-see for anyone who loves a good scare. In conclusion, this underrated horror thriller is a must-watch for fans of the genre. Its masterful suspense, atmospheric cinematography, and thoughtful exploration of fear make it a standout film that's not to be missed. So, if you're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you breathless, look no further.",401,2,1,False

And as mean and discouraging as it might sound, it mostly boils down to a laughably silly storyline and a rather amateur and unpolished directorial effort. The movie is about a woman who is trapped in a forest with three other strangers surrounding almost supernatural circumstances. The movie unfolds in a way that makes you realize pretty early on that whatever explanation is coming probably isn't going to be all that convincing, nor interesting for that matter, but you won't realize just how spontaneous and silly it all turns out to be. It's not the worst concept for a movie but it starts off with such a plain presentation of lackluster enthusiasm eventually turning into just pointless lore-building that's so out of place and silly that it fails to make an impact of any sort. The Watchers has a concept that could have worked better under more experienced hands, but unfortunately it just doesn't serve as good enough a showcase for debutant Shyamalan's talents.

Said no one. But this is exactly what we have been given with The Watchers 2024. Based on A. M. Shines novel, The Watcher tells the story of Mina, who gets lost in a dangerous magical wood on her way to deliver a bird to a zoo in northern Ireland. Upon exiting her vehicle she is soon saved by an old woman in a bunker with two other previously trapped people. From here we are presented with the rules of this forest as the characters try to survive and escape this unescapable forest. I should start by saying I don't usually do horror movies (I just can't tolerate jump scares). However, I had no trouble with this movie. There are a few jump scares, but they aren't very effective, which is likely a minus for horror fans. This is probably one of the biggest issues with the movie. While marketed as a horror, I would really consider this more of a dark fantasy. Whether intentionally or not, the film never conveys the feeling of dread like horror movies usually do, perhaps, because the pacing of the film is brutishly fast. That said, I appreciated that the plot was somewhat successfully conveyed in the 1hr 40min runtime. However, it's one of the few movies I've seen recently where I feel it might have improved with an extra 20-30min, so there would be time to develop the characters. The final act of the film indeed contains a twist like the films from papa Shymalan before. I personally didn't find the twist super satisfying, but I also didn't mind it either. Overall, I give The Watchers 6/10. While the character development was weak, I remained interested through the entire runtime.",304,3,3,True

Night and for good reason. I almost past of the film when I herd it was not, but I figure I give it a shoot. It felt like Ishana was purposely trying to do the opposite of her father's story telling in a movie that's totally up her father's alley. It was almost like the daughter was rebelling against what her father does, by doing the reverse of what daddy does (At least that would be a better excuse than she botched what her daddy does in movies) Once again, the movie is a good watch.

Sadly I was disappointed. The story definitely had some building suspense which I give it credit for, and the cinematography with the eerie woods was shot beautifully. But the concept and storyline iare the meat of the film and ithey failed to deliver big time. There were just so many things that didn't make any sense at all. 1) Why Mina doesn't turn around when she finds her GPS is taking her off road through a murky forest. Where cell reception is probably shoddy and the road is horrible? 2) Where is the power source for the Coop and why doesn't anyone try to investigate that? 3) How are they surviving in that concrete bunker for months and months without any running water? At no point in the movie did they show any water source nearby other than the lake they finally make it to when escaping the forest. 4) When told ""the rules"" by Madeline, why does nobody ask her how and where she got these rules? She's been there the longest. These seem to be a specific set of rules that she just seems to know. I personally suspected something about her from the beginning when she gave these rules, so the great twist wasn't really surprising to me. 5) Where did they get the rope from? 6) When do they sleep? They seem to be out hunting and looking for medicinal plants during the day, but they're up all night entertaining the Watchers...so they should be exhausted. Not only do they never seem exhausted, but they never seem bored either being stuck in a bunker for months on end with absolutely nothing to do other than watch the same episode of a reality TV show over and over. 7) BIGGEST plot hole of them all here - how are they in the Coop for months and months but NEVER look under the rug??? 8) Another HUGE plot hole - How was the professor capable of hiring men to build the Coop without the men he hired asking what happened to the previous crew that was working on it, and without anyone noticing or investigating the hundreds of missing workers from in the area???? 9) The college kept the professor's office untouched for 15 years??

It was entertaining enough, but felt like something was missing. It was a slow movie, and not in a satisfying way, however. The premise of the plot sounded very intriguing. I have listed a few cons that will likely steer me from rewatching the movie. Maybe it would've ruined the creepy, mystery element but giving us bits of lore earlier in the movie and spread out more, would have paced the story better. We just get a big dump of information 3/4 into the movie. For people who don't know Celtic mythology, I'm not sure if it was well explained. The movie needed to do a better job setting up its own rules (not taking about rules of the forest) so we know what to expect. It's fantastical in the beginning and then just becomes a movie about a dude in a bunker. One big con for me, was the quiet. It wasn't atmospherical, or loud silence, it was just a lack of noise. It's like when you're at the zoo, waiting for *favorite animal* to pop out of its burrough and it never really completely does, leaves you staring at the hole, bored out of your mind, and waiting for anything to happen. A movie that does silence well is The Quiet Place. I appreciated that the monsters were actually monsters, and that we got to see them. The creatures were pretty gruesome to look at; I always find shadow monsters creepy, so this was great. If they would've spent a little bitty bit more time on the eerieness of others in the world potentially being a changeling, that could have maybe saved it for me. If we're going to spend so much time in the woods, can we get more backstory about how many have been lost out there or see more stuff from the caves/nests? Connecting with people would let us have the severity of their danger, set the stakes. The forest is a character, gives us more on that. Also, please show and not tell, movie makers! Does this say more about the creators or our culture today that we can't be trusted to learn about characters without exposition. Nonverbals are so much more telling and an interesting choice than the characters giving an unemotional essay iny themselves-- at the weirdest of times. Did we really need the voicemail to know Fanning is running from family that love her? Why is her being a twin a twist? This could casually be brought up in conversation on many of the several days she's stuck with strangers for weeks. The guy randomly says his dad's an abusive alcoholic? Ok, that explains his personality, but lots of better ways to have told us. Ban unsolicited exposition! Give your audience some credit, make them pay attention.

This was one of my most anticipated movies of 2024 just based off the fact that this movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan's daughter, Ishana. After watching this movie, I can safely say that this is indeed a Shyamalan movie and in that regard it has all of the strengths and weaknesses of a Shyamalan Movie. Positives for The Watchers (2024): The concept of the movie is interesting, there are a lot of different directions that you can take this plot. The performances from the cast were all amazing. Dakota Fanning was very effective as the lead protangonist. Georgina Campball, Oliver Finnagan, and Olwen Fouere were also great, Fouere especially did a fantastic job at selling the sense of fear. The movie was shot very well The creature designs for the Watchers themselves were unique, especially for the budget that this movie had. And finally, I was very invested in the mystery of what these Watchers are and what their purpose ultimately is by the end of the movie. Negatives for The Watchers (2024): First of all there's this storyline involving Dakota Fanning's character about her childhood and certain tragic events that happened to her and I found that part to be very dull. Also, Once the movie starts revealing the answer to the mystery of these Watchers, the movie gets a little bit dumb. There's a character that gives us information regarding the Watchers and my response to that was, ""Of course, that's the answer to what these Watcher are."" And finally, the movie goes completely off the rails in the final 10 minutes. The conclusion of this movie as well as some information regarding Olwen Fouere's characters were so stupid and nonsensical. So, as much as I want to give props to Ishyana for what she did with this movie, at the same time, she also fell into the same pitfalls that her dad has fallen into with some of his movies. Overall, The Watchers (2024) was a movie that stared off amazingly with a great premise and great performances from the cast and unfortunately falls apart by the end. However, I still highly recommend that you go watch this movie, if nothing else then to see what Ishyana Night Shyamalan does with this movie and what I hope she does in the future, because much like her father, she has my attention.",414,3,4,False

The film is meticulous, with a smart storyline and worthwhile content I watched The Watchers (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline follows a young woman whose car breaks down in the wrong area, leading her to stumble into haunted woods where the only way to survive is to stand in front of a window and be watched at night, while scavenging for resources during the day. She doesn't believe this is the only way to live or that there's anything out there, so she plans to figure things out and discover just how real their situation is. Directed by Ishana Shyamalan (Servant), in her major motion picture debut, the film stars Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds), Olwen Fouéré (The Northman) and Georgina Campbell (Barbarian).

imdb_the_watchers_ionicbreezemachine_20240706,The Watchers,IMDb,IonicBreezeMachine,2024-07-06,5,NULL,"Ishana Night Shyamalan's debut feature does have style and an intriguing hook, but it's also massively overwritten with a premise that gets progressively sillier & convoluted Mina (Dakota Fanning) is a young American woman living in Northern Ireland working at a pet shop who is estranged from her sister Lucy (Dakota Fanning) due to the death of their mother. En route to deliver a golden concore to a zoo in Belfast. A strange force leads to her driving into a dense forested area where following car trouble she is soon lost with no visible way out of the woods. Wandering through the woods, she comes across a group of three people Madeline (Olwen Fouere), Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), and Ciara (Georgina Campbell) who are living in a large box shaped structured called The Coop, where creatures known as The Watchers observe them through the window every night. In order to survive the group follows a strict set of rules including never turning their back to the window, staying in the light and avoiding being out at night, and steering clear of the Watchers' burrows where they rest during the day. The Watchers is the debut writing and directing effort of Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of noted filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan who produced and financed the film. The film is adapted from the 2021 novel of the same name by A. M. Shine which was optioned by Shyamalan's production company Blinding Edge Pictures for adaptation with Ishana Night directing the film in her feature debut. While the announcement caused a massive (and rather undeserved) media scrum about neopotism, keep in mind that M. Night Shyamalan has financed all his movies himself since After Earth and Ishana Night has worked under her father as a second unit director on Knock at the Cabin and Old as well as writing and directing episodes of the TV series Servant. The Watchers is honestly a well-made and polished film per M. Night Shyamalan's usual standards, but it also has a number of weaknesses in Shyamalan's style coupled with a script that seems to have struggled adapting its source material. In terms of establishing mood and atmosphere I think Ishana Night Shyamalan does a solid job of keeping the film visually interesting and getting a lot of mileage out of the dense wooded location where the majority of the film takes place. Granted this does feel like a bottle movie to a degree, but I've also seen how much a premise like this can backfire (such as the Stephen King adaptation In the Tall Grass) and this largely avoids the pitfalls of that setup. While the movie is nicely atmospheric like M. Night Shyamalan's films, it also has similar weaknesses like very subdued acting, a story with logical gaffes, and a storyline that gets progressively sillier as it goes on. While I haven't read the book and can't speak as to whether or not these issues are inherent to the source material, on screen they often invite scrutiny to an already high concept premise that plays itself very seriously without really drawing the audience into it. There's a very heavy handed mythology behind The Watchers and while that's not in and of itself a bad thing, the way in which its presented to the audience with a very fast-and-loose internal logic often causes the audience to question how something is possible rather than being immersed by it. The actors play a very one note doe-eyed confusion throughout the runtime and there's also major issues that seem like they happen or didn't happen simply because the story needed to justify going a certain way at a certain point even if it didn't have internal logic to it. I honestly wish I liked The Watchers more than I do because in all honesty it is well made enough and with an intriguing hook that I was interested in where it was going, but after it was over (with what feels like two endings in sequence) I found myself reflecting on the various aspects that didn't make sense rather than the stuff that did work.

The story is a bit strange, odd and unique. The suspense and acting is decent, there are a couple of good scares and the reveal on who the titular watchers is pretty good too. However the movie isnt as gripping as one would expect it to be. Everyone is expecting and actively on the look out for a Shyamalan-esque twist ending, hence making it difficult for Ishana to deliver something completely unexpected. However she does a good job with the final twist. Even though Ishana's style of film making is heavily inspired by her father but just like with Servant, she has her own take on the genre. The Watchers has its moments, its twists and feels every bit like a Shyamalan movie which he could have made after Signs and before Split.

imdb_the_watchers_rgkarim_20240608,The Watchers,IMDb,rgkarim,2024-06-08,6,I Always Feel Like... Somebody's Watching Me!,"LIKES: The Setting The Camera Work The Acting The Character Story To A Degree The Graphics The Writing The Bird The Overall Story Is Okay SUMMARY: The Watchers is a movie that for the most part relies heavily on the imagination and the isolation effect to do the lifting of the movie. Under the guidance of Ishana, I found this movie successful in accomplishing this goal with camera work that finds optimum angles to convey the emotion of isolation. A fantastic setting of the grey European forest alongside dynamic lighting and special effects draws out a dismal and isolated feeling that leaves one feeling hopeless at times given the desolate world. As the world continues to reveal itself and the Watchers begin to emerge, the graphics continue to look decent, with smooth and horrific animation, some awesome details in the skin texture, and some haunting movements that further rip away the comfort and elicit the horror element. Sound editing that accompanies it further immerses you into the doomed forest, done well to optimize the terror and try to set you up for the jump scares they were shooting for. In regards to the story to which the scares are built from, it's okay. Another symbolic and artistic approach, The Watchers' story relies heavily on some folklore for adaptation, something that does not show up until the second half of the film, and that revelation is both a bit more original and lackluster at the same time. A gradual revelation shows a bit more merit helps escalate how far this tale goes, and assists with helping draw out the horror and help fill in some of the story gaps. The character stories flesh things out a bit more, each of the four ""heroes"" holding some light and depth that hold some realistic relatability to care for the characters stuck in this mess. This movie holds heavy dialogue and the writing is smart at times and engaging, with heavy words, engaging delivery, and a strong atmospheric tone to establish the rules. I found the words brought to life well by most of the acting in the limited cast of this film. Fanning is about the same as always, listless, and creepy, and can portray the more somber emotions better than most as she faces the horrors of her past and present. Campbell offers more variety, bringing a bit of light into the movie that helps cut through the monotone depression and keep things engaging, especially during some of the trials forced upon her. Fouere is articulate and creepy in her role, all of her words so heavy, deep, and accented that they bring gravity to help enhance the story elements and somehow make the unknown more uncomfortable. Oliver Finnegan as well plays his role well, adding that unbalanced nature that adds a bit more of that psychological component to the film, further keeping the teeter-totter swaying back and forth Add in a cute bird that does very little and yet so much to help contrast the tone of the movie, and you round out the movie's likes for me. DISLIKES: The Plot's Ending More Character Story Needed The Revelation is Disappointing The Twist Was Predictable More Danger and Suspense Needed Some Odd Plot Gaps A Bit More Emotional Components To the Characters SUMMARY: Despite all the elements that were engaging, The Watchers has issues with some of the usual nuances this movie genre suffers from. In the story department, the plot's ending is a bit of a letdown for me, not because of the content that they chose, but because the execution is mediocre and rushed at times. Perhaps we needed more gradual discovery in the woods, more time spent in the danger field, and a few moments edited to be earlier in the film. The characters needed more depth as well, helping to give them more layers like they tried to give Fanning's character and helping give me more to either root for or against. The editing might have helped with smoothing out plot gaps and questions that distracted me during the time. They do answer some of the questions, but there are still some unresolved or a stretch. And the twist that came was predictable for many reasons, and thus the revelation was mediocre for me as well. Perhaps the biggest thing needed though, is more terror and close calls. The Watchers is missing so much of that, with the climactic components very mundane because there was so much more they could do. After such an epic setup with the environment and camera work, the lack of real challenges and trials was a very disappointing finish for horror fans who like a little more bite to their thriller. The VERDICT Another movie of mundane horror, The Watchers has elements that the Shyamalan tribe knows how to do well in their movie media. Fantastic visuals, audio, and dialogue are the centerpieces of this film, with good characters and acting to a degree to bring it to life. It blends folklore and scares in a nice hybrid with some emotional depth beyond the typical horror movie. A smarter approach to conveying terror, returning to your imagination being the primary painter, it works so hard to play off of the fears of isolation, desolation, and hopelessness that made me feel more uncomfortable than the bad guys themselves. Where the movie fails is the pacing of the plot, spreading out that allure and explanation to give the film more bite, alongside needing more time and writing to the characters to build them up past the solemn humans we get. In addition, more scares, close calls, and strategy needed to be executed so that we might have a bit more excitement in suspense in their attempts to get out of the forest. Is this film worth a trip to the theater... I'm mixed. I would encourage you to support your local theater, but this movie feels better used at home to get the most out of your experience. In regards to my score, I rank The Watchers at: Fantasy/Horror/Mystery: 6.5-7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0.",1018,4,7,False

The story follows a young artist (Dakota Fanning) stranded in a pristine yet eerie forest, where she and three strangers are stalked by enigmatic creatures each night. Dakota Fanning delivers a compelling performance, capturing the vulnerability and resilience of her character. Georgina Campbell and Olwen Fouéré provide solid support, but the film struggles to fully utilize its talented cast, leaving much of the interpersonal dynamics unexplored. Shyamalan's direction showcases a strong visual style, with the Irish landscape serving as a character in its own right. The cinematography effectively heightens the sense of isolation, but the script leans too heavily on exposition and familiar horror tropes. While the creatures are unsettling in concept, their impact is diminished by predictable scares and a pacing that fails to build genuine suspense. Thematically, *The Watchers* flirts with deeper ideas about survival and human connection but ultimately opts for a more conventional resolution.

The story is simple with a very similar mysterious atmosphere as in The Village. Camera that moves in perfection like in series Servant, good book plots that keep viewers guessing, and that forrest at night horror feel makes the majority of this movie. And that's a good thing. What is not good is the ongoing departure from reality, where sometimes the characters behave unreasonably in situations that require more dramatic turns and more human-like reactions. Maybe we could say that this is a case of mediocre acting (something I reluctantly say as I loved Dakota performances in her previous movies), which in the end dropped the film to mediocrity. Also, the denouement at the end reminds me of Stephen King's novels; it is too long-winded, confusing, and as if it exits a horror plot.

As someone who loved the novel, I couldn't help but feel let down by how much of the story's emotional depth was sacrificed in favor of eerie visuals and suspenseful pacing. The film follows Mina (Dakota Fanning) as she becomes trapped in a secluded village, a place haunted by silent rituals and the constant fear of an unseen predator. While the setup is gripping, the lack of attention to Mina's backstory and inner struggles robs her of the complexity that made her so compelling in the book. The movie reduces her to a reactive protagonist, leaving her growth and choices feeling shallow and rushed. The villagers fare no better. In the novel, their paranoia and sacrifices made them deeply sympathetic, but here they're one-dimensional, serving more as spooky window dressing than actual characters. The interactions that should have added layers to the story feel like missed opportunities, leaving the twist (spoiler: Mina's actions unintentionally release the monster they've been guarding) feeling hollow rather than gut-wrenching. The creature design is impressive, and the film's visual and sound design build tension effectively. However, the payoff isn't enough to make up for the lack of emotional investment in the characters. The atmosphere is there, but without the novel's rich development, it feels like style over substance. If you haven't read the book, The Watchers might work as a passable horror flick.

Biggest quality here is acting, it was way above than the average acting of movies like this. Furthermore, it's flawed. It kinda lose a step during the last 40 minutes, pace was not that good and it should have been at least 10 minutes shorter. But i liked the fact that it tried to be original. It didn't succeed but it was not a failure either. There were some interesting ideas and whereas it is not the most intense/exciting movie i have watched, still i enjoyed it. Finally, i applaud this movie because it was positive. It's rare to find movies with positive messages nowadays, it's like most of them want you to feel sad and depressed. THE WATCHERS is a passable at least movie and its ending was satisfying.

The tension builds gradually, creating a sense of dread that lingers throughout the film. Although the story isn't groundbreaking and feels familiar, it's still quite enjoyable. There's a certain charm in its straightforwardness, allowing the viewer to become easily invested in the narrative. However, the acting was a major downside for me. The cast didn't feel natural or dynamic with each other, despite their efforts. The interactions seemed forced at times, which detracted from the overall immersion. The character backstories also needed more development, as they felt somewhat shallow and underexplored. A deeper dive into their histories could have added more layers to the narrative and made the characters more relatable. Furthermore, I believe a different cast could have significantly improved the film. The chemistry between the actors was lacking, and a more experienced ensemble might have brought out the nuances in the story more effectively.

The story progressed reasonably well,the characters wrre introduced their stories and backgrounds revealed seamlessly. We soon learn contrary to what the people in the room in the forest believe the watchers could break inside any time they wanted and they do so towards the end,the 4 characters discover a hatch and find recordings by the man that built the room and bunker and learn the watchers were an intelligent species coexisting with mankind until their banishment onto the grounds by mankind fearing their powers. They also learn a way for them to escape from the videos which they promptly do but at a price. The hints towards the plot twist were subtle and teased us well and when it did occur, The plot twist was truly unexpected and took us by surprise,the slow reveal of the watchers faces kept us on the edge of our seats especially when they put the camera outside,and towards the end when we saw their face,another good cgi,it made it kind of like we were wrong in observing them. The film excelled in creating a horror vibe all along especially when it defeated our belief that the watchers couldn't come inside the room even though they had the capabilities they just didn't want it,and saw the characters as mere somethings to mimic in their transformation practices. The sound effects of the watchers was pretty decent,their growls,their screeches and their thumping,the transformation they did growing tall being observed by the 2 characters that were locked out in a silhouetted fashion and their scrambling when another character snitched that 2 other characters were missing causing them to search for them as well as when they entered the room just in time collectively increased the tension and the scary factor of it. The reveal of the watcher with them and that it a mix of human and fae and the wings sprouting out was yet another plot twist inside another plot twist,and the subsequent reasoning made by Mina grouded the film as something that could legitimately occur in real life.

You know the type: shoulders perpetually shrugged up, neck hidden under a curtain of hair, head slightly tilted forward like she's permanently bracing for a sneeze. She's always typecast as ""woman who exists,"" and here she delivers that role with all the energy of someone reading IKEA instructions. The movie itself? Imagine The Cabin in the Woods stripped of humor, intelligence, or any actual stakes. A group of people get trapped in a cabin, monsters stare at them every night, and the audience stares back wondering if they left the oven on. Each character has ""unique traits"" that never matter, like the filmmakers wrote backstories for a high-school drama class and then forgot to use them. And then there's the yellow bird. Remember that? Supposedly important, symbolically meaningful, key to... something? Except if you cut it out, the entire movie would remain exactly the same. Still, credit where it's due: the bird gave one of the stronger performances in the film. Hit its marks, nailed its lines (when it wasn't clearly dubbed by a human), and executed flawless CGI flight. Honestly, the bird deserves its own spinoff, preferably one without Dakota Fanning staring at it like she's trying to remember her grocery list. The group eventually tries to escape with a boat, because apparently the monsters can't cross water. Very tense! Except Dakota literally arrived by car. On land. So... the water rule is just for vibes, I guess? Later the monsters show up in human form to chase her, because why not? Continuity is optional when you're this committed to nonsense. To pad things out, the characters give cutesy names to everything around the cabin like they're auditioning for Hunger Games: Forest Edition. Not for their own survival, no, just so we, the audience, can understand. How generous.

Writer-director Ishana Night Shyamalan has given us a movie that's creepy & maintains the eerie atmosphere throughout.

This really cuts down the tension in each scene & sometimes, can be unintentionally funny. My expectations were quite high because though this is Ishana Night Shyamalan's feature directorial debut, she's written & directed many fantastic episodes of Apple TV's horror/thriller series, Servant(2019-2023).

What I do like about the Shyamalan clan movies, is that they attempt (if awkwardly at times) to blend terror with human themes, with the emphasis on the theme rather than the terror, and they aren't afraid to infuse their horror with uplifting themes and happy endings. If we can make that happen with less pomp and more pizazz, less in-your-face message and more in-your-face filmmaking, and perhaps a bit more range in the actor performance, I can be onboard with this style of horror.",257,3,1,False

But people try, in the opening sequence we see John (Alistair Brammer) being pursued and dragged by unseen creatures into a giant burrow. Mina (Dakota Fanning) is an American living in Galway, working in a pet shop. She is troubled by past traumas, adopts new identities when going to bars. Her boss asks her to deliver a rare parrot to Belfast Zoo. She sets out but doesn't seem to realise that she is going off the beaten path eventually ending up lost in a forest. Following an old woman she arrives at a building which looks like a Beckettian bunker. The woman, Madeline (Olwen Fouéré) warns Mina that she invites death if she goes outside after dark. Madeline, a former lecturer informs Mina that there are Rules which must be obeyed if she and the others are to survive. Ciara (Georgina Campbell) has been there for 5 months, she's hoping her husband will return, Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) is passing his 8th month in the bunker. Madeline is a longtime resident. One wall is a mirrored window, the four must stand, and sometimes perform for the Watchers, unknown creatures who gather outside. A strange Folk Horror tale summoning up legends of a lost race which preceded human settlement and for a time co-existed. When we see the creatures they scuttle like spiders but rise up and are tall humanoid. There is talk of a professor who knew more but is now gone. They have a TV and VHS player but only a tape of a reality show, also a wind-up gramophone and a few items of furniture adding to the Beckett-like feel of the bunker. Huge burrows which contain lost items, having to forage for food, trap crows, it's a bleak existence as winter sets in. The woods are threatening, all encompassing but to survive they will have to attempt an escape. Rather disturbing scenes involving the creatures and their ability to mimic humans but again the woods, the mirrored window and lack of supplies add an existential element to the terror. Particularly good performances from Fouéré and Fanning. A few interesting plot twists which I won't reveal and it's best if I keep the Rules secret as well. A pretty good Folk Horror film.

Humans don't have magic, so it couldn't have been a spell. If the fairies lost their magic, then why did the forest have magical abilities that aided them? How was the halfbreed born? If it was half human, how did it live for so long? How did the professor find a way out of the woods shortly after arriving, but the daywalker couldn't figure it out for a millennia or however long it was trapped there?

Ishana Night Shyamalan clearly has talent in crafting intrigue and creating an atmosphere - the best parts of the movie are those early eerie moments we spend in the woods, but too often any emotional beat or potential scare is squashed by exhaustive explanation for the next hour or so. It's not even frustrating that the final act has this jarring tonal shift made worse by a predictable climax, it's that the movie rushes through it. Blink once and it's over. The pacing is all over the place. Folklore horror is such a fun subgenre and while the imagery is there, other aspects of the film really felt half-baked. Is The Watchers flawed? Yep! Did I like it? Also yep! Something I like about the Shyamalan family's work is the total, 100% commitment to whatever fantastical story is being told. There's something beautiful about the lack of irony, the complete devotion to whatever crazy plot they are trying to sell. Ishana has something, she just has to nail the pacing. I just appreciate the heart-on-the-sleeve sincerity of it all, it feels much like M. Night's 2004 film, The Village. The Watchers starts off intense and heart-pounding, but it never goes completely into the horror genre, rather it lingers on the border of that and the thriller genre. Still, there are some terrifying moments and it starts off very intriguing. Unfortunately, too much lore and overexplaining in the 3rd act drags it down - the basic rule of ""show don't tell"" seems to have been forgotten here.

I don't think it bored me, which is good. To give the movie credit, it does craft some pretty decent fear inducing scenes that were probably the best parts of the movie. If I were to begin with all the positives, the music actually is interesting and paired with the visuals of the expansive forest it does provide and feeling of eerieness. I'll say that the premise itself of the room (The Coop as they say in the movie) and the unseen Watchers is compelling. At first glance, it's unclear how this works and how the movie is going to put the pieces together and give us the full picture. The overall settings of the movie are pretty good with both the forest and the Coop giving of pretty decent and distinct atmospheres. The Coop in particular works and though it's meant to feel comforting with the warm lighting, it also gives an artificial feeling. I'll give Ishana Night Shyamalan. The directing is pretty good all around it's really the story and characters that provide the movie problems. Now, the movies story, apart from mabye, a twist or two, is kind of mediocre and predictable. The characters themselves are kind of flat. Almost all of their dialogue is either plot exposition or character exposition and it's almost as if your being talked down to at somepoints by the story as if you can't tell what's happening on the screen right in front of you. Also, the entire story is built on bad decisions by the characters. Most of these people make the worst decisions. Some of these decisions are kind of poetic and others are pure stupidity, which does dumb down the characters. They give the characters flaws and backstories, but it really doesn't feel as though they have personalities independent of the problems which they are currently struggling with. Also, there are a lot of jumpscare and quite a few of them are fake outs. Every time one of these predictible horror moments, I lose a great deal of respect for this movie. Even though I thought that had something pretty creepy with the Watchers and the location, even if there is something scary about the first time you really see them, that's lost once after a certain point. Now, the end really loses a lot of those things that worked in the beginning and middle. Once it was over I really didn't like where they'd left it as it didn't consolidate the good feelings I had for the film and once the title dropped and the credits rolled I was almost a little embarrassed for them. In conclusion, I feel iffy about it as though there is a skill in the craft here or there. There really are some blaring issues that I don't exactly like.

This is one of those low-budget films that relies heavily on the cast and script. The cast is small, with Dakota Fanning as the main protagonist and Georgina Campbell (known from Barbarian) also starring. The film has a supernatural element. People mysteriously experience vehicle breakdowns and are drawn into an ominous forest. A sign reads ""point of no return,"" which the characters obviously ignore, entering at their own risk and soon regretting it. You witness the fate of the first unwilling victim. Mina, a troubled girl, is heading home to see her sister. Predictably, she falls victim to this strange phenomenon. She is chased by an unknown creature and encounters a woman who leads her to safety in a cabin in the woods. In the cabin, there are strange rules everyone must follow to remain safe. The tension is expertly crafted. Mina is unwilling to abide by these rules and formulates a plan to escape. The filmmakers cleverly keep the creatures hidden, immersing the audience in the cast's experience. You feel the strange sounds and can't help but empathize with them. Dakota Fanning excels in the lead role, delivering a commendable performance alongside a cast of well-developed characters, which helps sell the film.

With the first two acts, Shyalaman keeps us guessing, and keeps the narrative tight and compelling, only allowing us to hear of legends of the creatures. It's really good stuff.

imdb_the_watchers_moviesfilmsreviewsinc_20240930,The Watchers,IMDb,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,2024-09-30,6,Weird Concept but was very predicable,"Watching The Watchers is a supernatural thriller directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, who has worked on the sets of Servant, Old, and Knock at the Cabin. The film, adapted from a novel by A. M. Shine, takes place in a magical Irish forest, a Bermuda Triangle of land that appears on no map. The film follows a quartet of strangers, known as The Coop, who are observed each night by a two-way mirror. Shyamalan effectively explains the dilemma, but the more detail-oriented may get stuck on unanswered questions. The film features Mina (Dakota Fanning), an artist with a birdcage, sketchbook, and genre-mandated family baggage. She is joined by Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), Kira (Georgina Campbell), and Madeline (Olwen Fouéré), the eldest of the captives. Madeline upholds the rules laid down by the unseen Watchers, such as never being outdoors after nightfall, poking around the deep burrows from which the Peeping Toms emerge, and never turning your back on the mirror. The film's exposition is effectively conveyed through the mouth of an actor with some presence and gravitas, like Fouéré, who delivers the exposition with some presence and gravitas. The Watchers is a suspenseful and intriguing film that combines elements of M. Night's The Village and the mystery-laced YA sensation The Maze Runner. The film's suspense and intrigue are evident as Ishana keeps the audience in the dark, allowing them to catch glimpses of what's lurking in the shadows. However, the film doesn't hold up to scrutiny and its pleasures are mostly in the delaying of revelations, not in their uncovering. The plot is dense with improbabilities and shaky motivations, which could be interpreted as an allegorical reading. The Coop, a small television set equipped with DVD episodes of a close-quarters reality show called Lair of Love, serves as an entertaining two-way mirror, offering an unseen audience a nightly window into the lives of four strangers. The Watchers ultimately has more mythology than genuine drama, with its pressure-cooker scenario never simmering into a satisfying war of wills. The wilderness convicts are closer to stick figures than multi-dimensional people, and the heroine's grief over a dead parent mirrors the parental anxieties the elder Shyamalan has increasingly foregrounded. Fanning, who acted mostly through the eyes, demonstrates her skill in acting through the eyes, a skill she first exhibited in War of the Worlds. The Watchers is a puzzle thriller that focuses on the mystery of a group of strangers imprisoned by unseen woodland observers. The director, Ishana Night Shyamalan, has a promising vision for her first feature, but lacks the formal prowess of her father. The movie offers glimmers of real craft and intrigue, but the big picture may make viewers want to scatter the pieces again. Shyamalan has absorbed lessons about suspense and atmosphere from her time on the sets of similar movies like Knock at the Cabin. However, as The Watchers comes together, it becomes less interesting and is best left unsolved.",495,1,1,False

I was expecting the plot to be some very common horror plot based on the trailer, but no, it is very unique and enjoyable. I see some critsism for the characters, the lead especially. People are saying that she's stupid, selfish and makes unrealistic descisions, and I have to say I disagree. Her not being very likeable and ""selfish"" is very obviously on purpose and honestly, it makes her more realistic. I think the idea of her being stupid comes from the fact that she didn't immediately believe others on something supernatural happening and had to check for herself before fully comitting to the rules and i hate to say it again, but that makes her even more realistic in my opinion. I, personally, liked it. If you're an average horror fan like me, you'll probably enjoy watching it too, it's also not very long and something is always happening so it won't bore you. The film doesn't really rely on jumpscares either, moreso on the atmosphere, It's a very specific vibe, the camera work, the music and etc makes you think that there will be a jumpscare, but there won't, mostly, and i always appreciate a horror movie that doesn't rely on jumpscares to actually procleim itself as a ""horror movie"".

I'd consider it a mild-horror fantasy. Sure, it could have been better maybe with some better talent taking the place of a couple of the actors.

And then the filmmaker chooses not to show us the famous lookouts of the forest until the last part, which gives us a feeling of very intense intrigue. We appreciate that the terror used is mainly psychological and that she knows how to play with shadows, sound, elements and the magic of the script rather than with jump scares. It is also possible that beyond the macabre fairy tale, these characters, who neither eat nor drink throughout the film, are simply a kind of symbolic resource to talk more deeply about the protagonist, her guilt and her trauma and the mythology invoked a metaphor. This way of seeing the film would explain the apparent inconsistencies... The truth is that with The Watchers we find a product very much made in Shyamalan, a film with touches of psychological horror, thriller and quite a bit of fantasy and of course those final twists so typical of the director.

The debut director (+ nepobaby) exhibits a solid grasp on the visual side of things, and though the film isn't scary in the slightest, it gives you early hints of her style of framing and compositions. The material is more mythical fantasy than horror, and even when she attempts incorporating conventional horror tropes (like discolored eyes, distant howls, weirdly tall creatures, etc.), they fail to enrich the plot. I don't know what kind of character development the protagonists get in the novel - none of them (including Dakota Fanning's) get any worthwhile emotional arcs in the film, that's for sure. It's not a good look when a golden conure exhibits more personality than any of the protagonists, is it? The film only works when it's mimicking moments from A Quiet Place (shhhh, don't move.. they're ""watching"" - what a bunch of voyeuristic fairies, I tell you!) but even they lack any thrilling outcomes. There's also a lot of essential information held back until the final moments, which indeed hold a lot of storytelling potential.

If you were hoping for a gripping thriller or even a mildly engaging film, prepare to be sorely disappointed. This movie is less of a watchable experience and more of a glaring testament to wasted potential. Let's start with the plot, which is a confounding mess of half-baked ideas and mind-numbing predictability. The story tries to juggle suspense and intrigue but ends up as an incoherent jumble of cliché-ridden nonsense. It's as though Shyamalan threw every thriller trope into a blender, hit 'puree,' and served us the resulting slop, making it feel like a tedious slog rather than an engaging narrative. The dialogue is equally abysmal. Characters speak in stilted, awkward exchanges that are meant to convey tension but instead come off as painfully contrived. It's clear that Shyamalan attempted to craft moments of dramatic weight, but the result is a series of cringe-worthy lines that do nothing but pull you further out of the experience. The characters themselves are painfully one-dimensional, offering no depth or nuance to invest in. The pacing is another major flaw. The film drags on with a snail's pace, stretching out what little plot there is into an excruciatingly long runtime. Scenes are either overly prolonged or abruptly cut, making it difficult to stay engaged or even understand what's happening. The result is a film that feels interminable and devoid of any meaningful payoff. This film is a dismal failure on almost every front. It's a film that squanders its potential with a disjointed plot, cringe-worthy dialogue, and an overall lack of coherence. The attempts at suspense and atmosphere fall flat, leaving you with nothing but a frustratingly forgettable experience.

To say I loved the movie would be an overstatement, and it's not perfect or mind blowing by any means. However, I do think it stays pretty true to the book. There are a few things that were changed for the movie, but I felt they were mostly minor things that didn't make too much of a difference. The biggest change, which did bother me slightly, was the bird. In the book, the bird has more importance because it always signals when the watchers are near. In the movie, it's just sort of there and adds no significance to the plot. I also felt the movie was lacking in character development a bit. Mina mentions that they've become like a family, but I didn't feel that while watching the movie like I did when I read the book. I think the movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the characters and their dynamic a bit more. One other issue I had with the movie was the ending. It wasn't done poorly, but I felt that it was much more suspenseful and creepy in the book. The movie leaves some parts out and it ends up feeling rushed.

Though that premise has been done to death (genre pun intended), ""The Watchers"" breathed a new kind of life, so to speak, into this slice of horror adapted from A. M. Shine's novel. Night Shyamalan's daughter, Ishana , seems to be following expertly in her father's brilliant footsteps. In the ""The Watchers"" 2024 movie, she wove a gripping, chilling, and unnerving tale that saw me questioning the nature of being human. Set in a pristine stretch of wilderness nestled in Ireland (near Galway), the story unfolded with a group of random people who found themselves the centre of attention, but for all the wrong reasons. A mysterious and apparently intelligent race of creatures indigenous to that area seemed to take pleasure in watching them at a bunker, which had since become their prison. Dakota Fanning (as Mina / Lucy) did amazing work sustaining the suspense in ""The Watchers"". I've been a fan of her work for a while now and she delivered a minimal yet memorable performance in this movie. She wasn't your random 'last girl'. There was an emotional enigma to her, one that felt human and real, namely a twin-sister connection and a mother who died from a car accident, for which Mina still believed her childish disobedience was the cause. Olwen Fouéré (as Madeline) brought added mystery-value to the movie. From her unforeseen appearance to what she went on to do as a character, this story benefited greatly from her contribution. Georgina Campbell (as Ciara) and Oliver Finnegan (as Daniel) brought some interesting vibes. They were fellow prisoners at the bunker in the woods and helped round out the story. Some kind of bizarre sorcery seemed to befuddle and confuse anyone who entered the stretch of the woods in that creepy part of Ireland. Before long, the bunker with a wall-window - which made it seem almost like a tank - become the cynosure of the movie. The hapless rovers who ended up here discovered what was expected of them. As for the 'why', well, that came later, explored in large part by Prof. Rory Kilmartin - played superbly by John Lynch. Suffice to say, the answer wasn't altogether comfortable. The chilling truth of their situation grew clearer and, more than just survival, decisive escape became the name of the game. As for the creatures, they were inordinately scary. I liked how they connected the species to ancient Irish lore, particularly the Fae. This was a classic Night Shyamalan touch, one emulated outstandingly well by his daughter Ishana Shyamalan. I loved everything about the Fae's backstory and ancient roots, including our once-upon-a-time co-existence with this extraordinary species, and the potential for their 'changeling' natures to adopt the shape of someone living or dead. While it was fiction, as far as we know, the lore used in the movie was as compelling as it was captivating. It led up to a chilling twist near the end, which I thoroughly admired. ""The Watchers"" was an amazing tale. It exemplified our eternal fascination with and fear of dark and brooding forests. The characters were compelling and their anxiety, palpable. It was also a distinct thrill to watch how the script tied it all up nicely without loose ends. Psychological horror blended with supernatural suspense in ""The Watchers"", which proved to be a sophisticated horror movie that has to be seen (without interruptions) to be fully appreciated. --- --- --- Noteworthy performance from Alistair Brammer (as John).",582,3,4,True

I don't think it's particularly successful but at the same time I wouldn't say I hated it either. Mina (Dakota Fanning) an American living in Ireland, is travelling through ancient woods when her car suddenly breaks down. After becoming disorientated and with the sun setting, she sees Madeline (Olwen Fouere) who encourages her to join her in an isolated construction. The construction is a room with a wall that is entirely made of one-way glass, allowing people to see in, but showing the inhabitants only their reflection. Along with two other inhabitants, Clara (Georgina Campbell) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) the four are watched through the window by an unseen group. Whilst they can roam safely about the forest during the day, to hunt or gather supplies, they must be back at ""The Coop"" before it goes dark. Interestingly, as soon as I learned that the film takes place in Ireland I guessed immediately what the Watchers were. I'm going to talk without spoilers though for the rest of the review. I will say a lot rests on the reveal of the watchers and there are good and bad elements to it. Generally, they are kept in the dark, a hand here or a movement there. There's one scene at night when they gather in silhouette that is very creepy. Later though you get a much better look, and their CGI blandness I found to be disappointing. The films principle failing is that ultimately, it's not that scary. The creepier moments are generally played in the trailer, the Theremin record, the applause moment. I wonder if perhaps one of the problems was Dakota Fanning's aloof and rather non-plussed reaction to all that happens to her. I also think there's an aspect of ""elevated horror"" that the film wants to engage with, with Mina's undealt with response to the death of her mother being part of her reaction. I think I've sounded pretty negative about the film so far, but there were some small positive elements. Generally, I liked the direction and, cinematography. For the second film this year, Olwen Fouere is left dishing out horror movie exposition and does a good job with it. I probably sits uneasily in the ""I don't recommend this, but I didn't hate it"" category and I do look forward to seeing what Ishana Night Shyamalan does next.",399,4,3,False

However, it is not the great cinematographic work either... horror/mystery/fantasy that's what the synopsis said, but in fact it doesn't amount to any specific one, and you're left kind of half-finished in everything. You don't believe the fantasy, you don't really feel terror, and in the mystery you already decipher the outcome halfway through the film, at least that happened to me. The idea is not bad, but the plot lacked some consistency, because when something wants to involve you, the story radically changes, and the moment comes when you think: will it take long to finish? It must be made clear that it is not bad, it entertains you, yes, but with so much on offer to see, this is not a must see. I like the subject matter itself and have always liked it, but the film didn't move me. Olwen Fouéré surpassed Dakota Fanning and that must be accepted, at least in this film it was.

imdb_the_watchers_gelikoptergelikopter_20240906,The Watchers,IMDb,gelikoptergelikopter,2024-09-06,8,Faithful and respectful adaptation of the book (penalty for redhead erasure though!),"After I finished reading The Watchers by AM Shine back in 2022, my first thought was: ""How is this not a movie yet?"". All the ingredients for an excellent, refreshing, original and visually pleasing horror film are right there. The setting in Ireland, with the mythology and folklore, is also something we don't see often. At the time, I even looked online to see if a film was already in the works, but I could find no indication that it was. I imagine if I'd only checked a few months later, I would have found some information on IMDB about it's production. Imagine my surprise today. I started my HBO Max, not expecting to find anything new or exciting at all. I saw the thumb nail of ""The Watchers"" a few days before, and thought of AM Shine's book right away. Still, i imagined it must just be a coincidence that the title was the same. I just really couldn't imagine the book had already been adapted. 2021 just doesn't feel very long ago at all. Sadly, ""The Watchers"" theatrical release completely eluded me, and it's no longer playing. I'm very miffed about this, as the score is excellent and I would have loved to catch the excitement on the big screen. I imagine I would have been far more impressed still if I didn't already know how the story ended! Going in blind with this movie in theaters is an experience I'll sorely miss, though I treasure my time first reading the book. As for the more technical aspects of the movie. I like the effects. The Watchers look exactly as I pictured them, with the same frantic, empty, tragic presence as they have in the book. I never pictured Dakota Fanning for the role. I can't honestly say how I feel about her acting. Suffice it to say I wasn't blown away by it, but it also did not detract from my immersion in the film. One pet peeve when it comes to casting. Feel free to skip this part of the review if you don't care about identity politics. I just have to get this out of my system. SPOILERS AHEAD IN THIS PARAGRAPH ONLY The young woman with the dark skin (no offense to her, she's lovely) replaces a character in the book who was meant to be an Irish redhead(!) The actress who plays her is not even Irish, she is British! Double foul! Anyone who knows the history of Ireland vs the British and the treatment of redhaired people will see how deeply offensive and problematic this is. In an attempt to be more diverse and include a person of colour, they have actually suppressed another minority. And then, guess what, the only redhaired person in the whole movie is literally a monster child with a deformed face! What the hell? It honestly makes me quite mad. In my opinion, redhaired women are some of the most beautiful creatures on earth. Must Hollywood really crush the spark of every flame haired maiden under their cold hard boot? If you don't believe me, or if you think I'm just a right-wing nut case for saying this, I'm not. Look up ""redhead erasure"" on Youtube, or Google. YES, you will find a bunch of right wing sources, but the evidence is overwhelming. Just look at the recent controversersy around the Little Mermaid and Triss Merigold in The Witcher series, Zendaya as MJ, the list goes on! These are just some examples, there are countless more! So, anyways, back to the review... Aside from what I just ranted about, I think this movie has very few flaws, and any flaws it does have, were already present in the source material. As always, you will find reviewers complaining that it isn't EXACTLY like the book, but I'm not one of those people. As movie adaptations of novels go, this is far more faithful than most, well above the norm. It's been two years since I read the book, but I'd say the story is easily over 90% identical. In my opinion, if you liked the book, you have to try pretty hard to hate this movie, which even has the original author credited as one of the writers. Vice versa, if you liked this movie, go read the novel, it's great, good pacing and not too long of a read. Also, it has a lovely redhead in it!!!",740,3,4,True

It was interesting and thought provoking as most films by the shamayalans are. However. The takeaway I had from this movie is that it is a modern metaphor, and I haven't seen anyone else on here touch on this. I believe the film to be a metaphor for the modern day advent of Artificial intelligence. A line is said about the mimics the watchers make becoming better over time. Furthermore, it is stated that at first they had details wrong like too many fingers. Too many fingers Is a very common error made in artificially generated images of humans. Also the movies states sometimes body parts are elongated or distorted, which is common as well. I believe this is reinforced by all the symbolism of the 1 way mirror, as well as the main character having an identical twin sister. Eventually artificial intelligence will be competing with humanity for roles and jobs in society. Overall the movie was enjoyable, I just felt like this metaphor really adds another level to the film.

Taking her parrot she finds a structure where a trio of occupants; Georgina Campbell, Olwen Fouere & Oliver Finnegan who explain she's joined them to be trapped at the mercy of some nocturnal creatures who study them like pets in a cage while during the day they have the run of the area which has a fenced in perimeter.

It's a great premise setting up the story, but quickly backing itself into a corner, through a series of illogical plot devices, before the first act is over. To dig itself out,instead of pretending that this would be a terrifying bloodbath... There are no jump scares but some nice imagery and relatively tense moments.

The fairy tale/ fantasy plays out well but lacks a spark. The characters are bland and there is no one to relate to or care about, with the one exception... The Watchers does have a few bright spots to speak of. I liked the concept of The Coop and how it's a twist on a cage in a zoo. The movie is impressively dark and moody thanks to the cinematography of Eli Arenson. Dakota Fanning does well in portraying Mina who shakes off her doldrums and takes charge of the situation...

Night Shamalan who directed it, but his daughter Ishana Night Shyamalan's. You would never know though. The apple really doesn't fall far from the tree. Her directing style and choice of script are incredibly similar to her dads. He did produce it though which. Ishana also wrote the script which, although amateur is pretty impressive. The concept of this movie like many of her father's movies was intriguing but a little poorly executed. An American woman living in Scottland who we can tell right away is haunted by something in her past. I felt this was a little forced. This is a woman who seems to have just given up on life. She works at a dead-end job at a pet store and has regular one-night stands with guys she couldn't care less about. She is completely devoid of any joy in her life. She gets and assignment to take a bird to some people who purchased it in some remote area of Scottland. She drives there with the bird and her car dies in the middle of a creepy forest, but this is no ordinary creepy forest. This is a forest occupied by some ""creatures"". (These are truly things that go bump in the night) She is forced to abandon the car and run to a cabin in the woods. There are three other people already living there. She learns that if she tries to leave these creatures living in the forest will kill her. But if she follows certain rules, she can survive. I has a kind of reminded me of the creature feature movies I used to watch on the Sunday afternoon creature feature. It leans on folklore and fairy tales. There weren't a lot of jump scares which I appreciated. I think a lot of horror movies rely too heavily on them. Apparently, this is based on the book, but I haven't read it, so I can't compare it. I just have to judge the movie on its own. The characters should be way worse for the wear considering some of them have been there for months. We are talking in the middle of nowhere without most normal amenities that people need like soap. It didn't look like there was any water source to bathe. Food doesn't seem very plentiful. They should look sicklier. I would've thought she'd let the bird go at one point. How could it survive? What did she feed it? How did she clean the cage? They do a very good job at making this forest as creepy ad isolated as possibles. It really creates a feeling of unease and hopelessness of everyone getting out of it. Even the cabin they seek haven in is unwelcoming. The acting is impressive, esp. By Dakota Fanning. She plays the intelligent, stoic and damaged woman very well. The night scenes are filmed really dark, so you don't really see the creatures until the end of the movie and when you do finally see them, It's kind of a letdown. The CGI is not very impressive. A+ for atmosphere though. It poses the question of what we would be willing to do to be free. Would we risk our life or give up our freedom to be ""safe"". It's not the greatest movie and Ishana Night Shyamalan certainly isn't as talented as her father. He's not even as talented as himself sometimes if you know what I mean. He's pretty hit and miss. But it keeps the tension and you wondering what's going on. I was impressed with the musical score. There was a lot of traditional Irish music which is apropos. I was also impressed with the sound mixing and editing. Like her father's films there is also a lot in this film where the audience has to suspend disbelief. These people are stuck in a cabin in the woods with no contact with the outside world. In reality they would not be able to survive. They wouldn't be able to find enough food to sustain themselves. They are holding up way to well for people who can't bathe and have to do their business in the woods. They look to clean and healthy for people living isolated in the woods.

Essentially a low-budget premise but with a high concept and stakes to match, The Watchers (or The Watched if you're in the UK) is a compelling character study of what makes us who we are. Everyone wears masks but it's the reasons we choose the masks we hide behind that reveal who we truly are. Mina (Dakota Fanning) works in a pet shop in Ireland and spends her nights being someone more interesting as she seeks to add meaning to her empty existence, as she struggles with the guilt of her mother's death. She sets out to deliver a valuable golden-coloured bird for work and her car breaks down in a forest where she soon realises things aren't what they seem. What follows is a story that hinges on creeping tension, a sense of dread, fear of the unknown and characters that exhibit a sense of longing that binds them together as a surrogate family. With a healthy dash of Irish folklore, The Watchers is a tale of grief and how it consumes us, connections and how they define us and ultimately the fairy tales that get us through life. Directorial touches feather thematic references with ease across the film. Be it the focus on Dakota Fanning's eyes as they watch herself in the mirror, the mannequins that watch her from the shop window, the animals being watched by the shop owners and how they observe the ones watching, care is taken to have different layers of perception, elevating the narrative and highlighting that we are all watchers and indeed, being watched. A small cast led by Dakota Fanning provides strong intimate character-driven performances required to weave a compelling story. Dakota and Olsen Fouere are the standout cast members who help set the rules of the Forest and test them. The Watchers themselves are creatures of the night that are mostly heard and rarely seen. Their presence is foreboding and ominous, turning the screws of tension with every scene, building up to the film's satisfying climax. The coop in the woods that imprisons the characters, surrounded by mysterious watchers that revel in observing their captives, is an apt analogy for this first time filmmaker. In a time of AI-dominated creativity, it's also interesting to observe that even the changelings in the film struggle to get human hands right, just as artificial intelligence does. Similarly, AI cannot replicate human spontaneity, something the changelings aren't able to achieve either. It's in moments like these, for example when Ciara breaks into her final dance, that drive home that despite the traumas we face, we have a lot to live for and celebrate. With the weight of M Night Shyamalan behind her, Ishana Night delivers an astonishing debut. Riveting storytelling, moments so tense you can feel the woods-frosted breath in the cinema, crackling performances and a fairytale beginning that has her unique imprint on every frame. Standing on the shoulders of her father, Ishana makes her own mark with The Watchers and shows a mastery of visual storytelling that is both exciting and fresh. The greatest compliment I can pay the film is through my experience of it. I saw it on opening night then returned with my 17 year old daughter the next day to re-experience it with her and introduce her to a new filmmaker who will undoubtedly be telling stories for her generation. We got home and I told her, ""If you liked this, just wait until you see ""The Sixth Sense"". Our weekend plans were made. Ishana's debut on the big screen and M Night Shyamalan's in our home theatre. Everything feels complete and the future of eerie, unnerving yet enthralling stories is in good hands.",651,8,20,True

The lost live in a bunker for months, do not wash, do not eat, do not drink and stand in front of the window every evening, admiring the terrible ancient creatures.

Dakota Fanning in the lead is as good as ever, and she is ably supported by most of the cast - fortunately it is a small one. The set and setting are eerie and provide a creepy backdrop to support the narrative. The bad points: The plot is preposterous. Setting aside the main subject matter of the story, one has to ask how and why any of this would actually happen as set out in the script. The plot holes are bigger than the forest in which the film is set. It is as though whenever the writer gets to a point in which they need to explain something unlikely, they turned to a six year-old idiot and throw them the pen. For example, the reason that the professor's university office remains in its original state is unfathomably ridiculous. There is also the odd moment of condescension where the film literally provides a cartoon explanation of the narrative in the form of a completely unnecessary historical scroll.

But as it went on, it started to feel a little.....forced? I dunno. To be perfectly blunt, this movie treats its audience like they are dumb. It literally explains everything that is happening like the audience couldnt infer or deduce based on the events as they unfold. Maybe it was studio interference thinking audiences wouldnt get it? Again, hard to say, but this movie came off like it was for viewers that have completely turned off their brains and dont have any critical thinking or deductive reasoning to exercise. The acting/writing was a little stiff too and not quite sure the chemistry amongst the actors worked. It does have a hard twist about 2/3 of the way through - this was directed by Ishana Shyamalan, M.

Characters speak in exposition, not emotions, which kills immersion and tension. Even when the film tries to ""show,"" it leans on awkward flashbacks and metaphors that feel disconnected from any real emotional stakes. Dakota Fanning does what she can, but most of the cast delivers stiff, unconvincing performances.

As for the double twist ending... well, it's kind of like waiting for Darth Vader to drop a bombshell, only for him to tell you about the weather on Tatooine instead. You see it coming, raise an eyebrow, and then move on. It's like Ishana took notes from her father but skipped the chapter on ""how to truly surprise your audience."" Les Guetteurs has some cool ideas and sleek visuals, but the script sinks under the weight of its own inconsistencies and laziness. Ishana Shyamalan tries to walk in her father's footsteps but ends up tripping over the roots in the forest. In the end, it's watchable but forgettable.",343,1,0,False

It's a constantly evolving experience, moving through several somewhat distinct acts defined only by your understanding of its plot's events. This is evidence of its keen awareness of its audience, as it is able to predict what you're thinking in order to set up a blindsiding reveal. A lot of the narrative is ambiguous, despite a fairly concrete end, and it makes for an extremely enigmatic watch, one in which your assumptions are always shifting and, somehow, never quite correct. When you think back on the piece, you realise how meticulously crafted it is right from the opening shot. It's exactly what it needs to be, even if it does sometimes seem slightly meandering and you can certainly feel its length. It's never even close to boring, constantly keeping you engaged and occasionally wrenching you to the edge of your seat. It's the kind of film that sneaks up on you; you don't realise your heart is in your mouth until it's too late. It's as much a mystery as it is a horror, but it's ultimately rather frightening. It has moments of wince-inducing gore, creepy imagery and unbearable tension but it's its overall effect that affects you the most. It's difficult to describe, really, but to say the picture is ominous is an understatement. Its only real flaw is the fact that some of its odd comedy, particularly in its earlier sequences, detracts ever-so-slightly from the sincerity of its narrative. Still, even this contributes to the story's decidedly off-kilter vibe. When it comes down to it, the thing is absolutely brilliant, a distinct and distinguished movie unlike most others of its kind. It gets under your skin and wriggles around for a long time. 8/10",313,84,17,False
imdb_the_wailing_wcoleparks_20160620,The Wailing,IMDb,wcoleparks,2016-06-20,8,Beware The Wailing! This film will stick with you,"The Wailing opens with a quote from the bible. It is easy to forget this fact while watching most of the film, but at a certain point it becomes clear the purpose that quote served. It is almost like a warning: ""if you are a religious person, this film will scare every part of you."" This is where The Wailing works so well. As a religious parable, it overcomes its lengthy running time and tonal imbalance, to deliver an often funny but truly terrifying film. When a mysterious stranger moves to a small village in South Korea, the village becomes plagued by sickness. The police think a wild mushroom is to blame, but police officer Jong-goo thinks it may have something to do with the stranger. He meets a woman who gives him some information about this mysterious man, and slowly begins to fall down a rabbit hole that consumes his life. When his daughter starts to show signs of the sickness, it gets personal and he must figure out who to trust and who to avoid. The director, Hong-jin Na, struggles to find a good tonal balance. At times pitch perfect and at other times all over the place, the tone struggles to stay consistent. For the first third of the film, it is primarily a funny movie with briefs bursts of depravity and violence. The comedy works well and I found myself laughing a number of times. Then when the horrific imagery would come up it was sudden and effective. There was a good balance here that gets lost in the second act. The comedy becomes more slapstick and does not fit with the rest of the film. The characters also become over-the-top and act in exaggerated ways very different from how they were introduced. This middle section also has some moments of unintentional humor. One example sees a man struck by lightening and another has the caller ID for a shaman come up on the phone as ""Shaman"". Fortunately it finds a good balance again in the third act, but smartly switches it up from the first act. It becomes intense and terrifying with a few moments of comedy to offset the horror. And what a terrifying last act it is. As everything starts to unfold, the audience gains a new appreciation of the rest of the film and starts to reinterpret certain scenes. The only problem is that a few of these scenes only made sense once the film ended. Rather than feeling natural and fitting in as the story progressed, they required the ending to actually make sense. At 2 hours and 36 minutes, the film is just too long. The middle portion of the film is where this could have been resolved. The shaman had too much screen time performing various rituals that ended up not being very important. There was also a 'zombie' scene that felt awkward and didn't fit in with the rest of the movie. It seemed as though they wanted to put a zombie in the film just because of their growing popularity. This scene also brings in a number of random characters that serve no purpose in the rest of the film. Despite a few scenes with the previously mentioned overacting, the acting generally speaking is fantastic. The father tasked with solving whatever is happening to his daughter, conveys the terror and hatred he is building up with an intense persona he carries throughout the film. A priest in training who comes in to give advice on what the father should do is equally effective. He brings a concerned and innocent quality to the terror that will ultimately happen. But it is the young daughter who gets sick, that really shines. Channeling her inner Linda Blair, she emphatically delivers horrible, dirty lines that no child should ever say. Her performance is truly terrifying as you watch the hatred in her eyes slowly take over. As the film comes to an end, the religious overtones become clearer. Locusts attack an individual. White and black are used to suggest character's true nature. And it is in these scenes where the film truly shines. By slowly unveiling the real nature of certain characters, the last 45 minutes of the movie will change your perspective on the whole thing. Every few minutes you will switch sides when trying to determine whom to trust and only when the big reveal comes do you realize how detailed the setup to get there was. The reveal really puts a twist on everything that led up to it and the film ultimately becomes about the horrors of putting your faith in the wrong people.

imdb_the_wailing_kjihwan_20160916,The Wailing,IMDb,kjihwan,2016-09-16,7,An accomplished occult thriller too open-ended for its own good,"Director Na, Hong-jin catapulted himself into the Korean directing elite with his much lauded debut movie, The Chaser, back in 2008. His follow-up, The Yellow Sea, received more tepid response, but there was little doubt that here was a movie-maker who had the potential to be spoken of in the same sentence as Bong Joon-ho and Park Chan-wook. His latest, The Wailing, starts with more than a passing resemblance to Bong's masterpiece, Memories of Murder. There's a series of grisly, unexplained murders in a backward-looking (although in The Wailing's case contemporary) countryside, which is then investigated by ordinary cops - more put-upon locals in uniform than law enforcers - increasingly out of their depth. What appears first as simple murders of passion begins to spread across the village, while an increasing number of people fall victim to a violent - and violence-inducing - fever, including the young daughter of one of the policemen on the case, Jong- gu. A portly every-man and a doting father, he is bewildered by the severity of the crimes (especially so in a hitherto tranquil countryside) and heart-broken by his daughter's sudden affliction. Desperate to find a cure, Jong-gu (played by Kwak, Do-won, a Na alumnus from Yellow Sea) and his friends latch onto the fact that the fever seemingly started after an unknown Japanese man appeared in the area. The more they delve into the stranger (Jun Kunimura, best known for getting decapitated by Lucy Liu in Kill Bill), the more Jong-gu realizes that the situation may belong more in the realms of the unnatural. Enlisting the help of a charismatic shaman, Jong-gu goes to the extremes to find a solution. Fittingly for the fishing motif that's so prevalent in the film, however, the more he bites at the problem, the more he seems to be ensnared. It's been a while since a Korean film had this kind of craftsmanship and artistic control to match its ambition. In many ways The Wailing is the true successor to the class of 2003 - when A Tale of Two Sisters and Oldboy as well as the aforementioned Memories of Murder were released - with how confidently the visuals are displayed, the themes are interwoven, and the story unfolds. The forebodingly beautiful cinematography nods at Kubrick, the acting is exemplary (including a worryingly remarkable turn from the child actress Kim, Hwan-hee as Jong-gu's daughter), and most of all the atmosphere of escalating horror that Na captures is impressively unsavoury indeed. The film is a bold departure (or throwback, depending on how you look at it) for Korean cinema in its heavy emphasis on the occult, a theme more associated in the country with the well-worn moralism of its ghost stories and the oft-parodied rituals of harlequin-esque shamans. At well over two and a half hours, The Wailing is a hefty movie, but with its potent mixture of procedural mystery, black comedy and a prevailing sense of dread, it commands attention masterfully for much of the duration. The one drawback for the film is a significant one that takes the shine off what could otherwise have been a landmark movie. During the course of the film Na throws a number of questions and macguffins up in the air. Who or what is causing the fever? Can the shaman be trusted? Is the Japanese stranger a victim of xenophobia? Who is the nameless girl always hovering around the crime scenes? Or is it all just collective hallucination caused by bad mushrooms? The Wailing takes its twists and turns, apparently answering the questions and overturning expectations. But then it keeps going, reopening closed plot strands and even downright contradicting itself on occasions. It soon becomes apparent that Na isn't so much interested in telling a self-contained story than an exercise in audience-baiting. All of the elements in the film which were so compelling and enjoyable are not allowed to coalesce together in the end, and the actions and motives of the major characters - the Japanese man, Jong-gu and his daughter, the shaman, the nameless girl - are ultimately rendered disparate, abstract and illogical. The ending is neither closed nor open-ended, but rather wilfully indeterminate, and it's tempting to think that Na is applying the film's fishing motif to the audience.

They play integral part of horror movies, but when a movie mostly relies on them and is not supported with great story, I am always left displeased. What makes The Wailing so special is that there are almost no jump scares at all in this film. Instead, we, the viewers, are taken through a story rich with mystery, great characters and their struggles, dark atmosphere with well designed and amazingly crafted horror scenes that make your blood run cold. Also, in addition the movie carries a great subtext left for the viewer to question, find evidence and interpret it. You can feel that the director took some time and did some research to give us as much real horror experience as possible. One might find The Wailing a bit boring because the film is a slow burner and not constructed as most of modern horror films, or might find the film too long (running time 2h 36min) but if you are patient man it will pay off by the end. Who says that the horror genre is dead. You just have to look beyond those cash grab mainstream horror films with wide releases and you might find some hidden gems.",216,227,71,True

Unfortunately I was left a little conflicted. The film's premise is a mix of tropes (possession, good vs. evil, religious mythology), and its slow-burn narrative is set in a relatively poor, rural village in South Korea. The tone the movie strikes at first is one of slapstick and black-comedy. The local police are incompetent, unfit and seemingly terrified of everything. I laughed quite a few times throughout. We get little character development; these aren't complicated people. The lead protagonist, Jong-goo, has about as much depth as a petri dish, and - work-shy and cowardly - doesn't inspire much sympathy. Then there's a jarring tonal shift towards seriousness. Seeing Jong-goo distraught over the mystery sickness his daughter is plagued by didn't move me at all, because the goings-on up until that point had been dealt with so flippantly and the characters were painted as comic foils contrasting with the horrific murders. Why would we care about what's happening to these people, when they've been painted as two- dimensional and foolish? The film's final half-an-hour redeemed it somewhat. I'd predicted the twist that the Japanese man was wrongly vilified and was trying to save the village, so when the shaman confirmed it, I was disappointed by how obvious it had been. But then it turned out to be a bluff! Which took me by surprise. He's evil after all. The ending was particularly strong; tragic, but poignant, with some allegorical revelations. The characters make some strange decisions throughout. Why, when Jong-goo discovered the Japanese man had a shrine with photographs of the recent village murders, did he, his colleague and the deacon simply run off? Bring the man in for questioning at least. Get his DNA. Do some actual police work. And why, if the Japanese man was a malevolent being, did he not offer some excuse to put Jong-goo et al off the scent? He made no effort to mislead them (beyond using the shaman), even when there was every opportunity to lie or distract Jong-goo each occasion they confronted him on the top of the mountain. The benevolent ghost Moo-myeong could've made everything clear early on if she'd been less ambiguous - instead she drip-fed pieces of information to Jong-goo, all too late. If she actually wanted to save the village, she could've easily done it. When characters act in improbable or irrational ways in order to confuse the audience so the revelation is a surprise, that's lazy writing in my opinion. To me, this seems like this was just to force ambiguity so we weren't sure who was trustworthy or not, who was 'real' or not. So it's a mixed bag of a movie. The positives are the setting, the basic plot and the pacing. The negatives are the tonal shifts, the shallow characters, some of the writing. There's a gem hidden in there somewhere, I just think it could've shone brighter if handled differently.",502,21,14,True

imdb_the_wailing_ctowyi_20160730,The Wailing,IMDb,ctowyi,2016-07-30,9,A Smorgasbord of Many Genres and Near un-Killable Zombies,"SPOILER: This review is extremely difficult to pen without dropping spoilers, but I am going to try... Na Hong-jin's The Chaser (2008) audaciously broke one of cinema's golden rules to heartbreaking effect. His sophomore effort The Yellow Sea (2010) is a pulsating rush of blood and bone. 6 years later comes The Wailing, a gruesome blend of different genres and it is near impossible to pigeonhole. Na Hong-jin has graduated to a whole new level with The Wailing, a smorgasbord of investigative procedural, humour, horror, supernatural, family drama, and near un-killable zombies. Whether you are the filmmaker or the viewer, it can be really hard to start a film. No one sitting in the pitch-black cinema is your friend yet and the beginning of any film always feels like a forced act of intimacy for the viewer. A hooker can help. No, I don't mean a prostitute but a good first scene 😬. The Wailing opens with a verse from the Bible, Luke 24:38-39 and cuts to a scene of a forlorn man double hooking a worm before fishing from a boulder. The scene is beguiling, laden with an atmosphere of dread and your consciousness will immediately lock in the little noggin of information that his unusual act has a higher purpose. Two and a half hours later and after a post-movie long table discussion with 13 other animated persons and more than a day of further discussion on a WhatsApp chat group, I am wiser. The first scene of The Wailing is a blue-ribbon winner and so it goes for the rest of the film. The big story is easy - a Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) arrives in a little village and soon a mysterious sickness starts to spread. Grisly murders ensue and a strange young woman (Chun Woo-Hee) and a bombastic shaman (Hwang Jung-Min) enter into the fray. A bumbling and lazy policeman (Kwak Do Won) is drawn in and he has to get to the crux of the mystery in order to save his daughter. It is the intricate workings of the plot that needs a lot of unpacking. Forget about the age-old Hollywood adage that a good film has a plot that is easily summarised. The last time I had so much fun dismantling and assembling back a movie was Inception! The Wailing is a stupendous and sustained piece of masterful storytelling. It is loaded with frightful incidents and stuffed with mystifying characters. On top of that, it is genuinely terrifying as it preys on the goodness of ordinary people. God has seemingly excused Himself from the battleground as can be gleaned from a scene in which the church says it will not lift a finger to help. The story is compelling and riveting, and every twist, turn and outcome totally earned. The movie has a punishing runtime of 156 minutes not because of poor pacing, but because of the intricacies of the plot. There are plenty of bloody scenes for the gore-hounds but they are never ladled out to pump up a sagging plot. The plot never sags, not even for one instance. Na's use of music and sounds to heighten the suspense is brilliant. From plaintive tonal chords in the beginning to a full-blown thunderous ""tong tong qiang"" exorcism ritual, everything adds to the atmosphere of doom. Na has also achieved such sublime tonal shifts that I didn't even notice where I went from laughing out loud to pure heart-parked-in-my-mouth terror. The film is suffused with motifs, religious overtones and thematically rich. Even an innocuous scene of a young woman throwing stones has biblical weight. The storytelling is powerful and the twists perfectly angled into the story. So many times I had that ""aha"" feeling that told me I had the mystery figured out and the motivations of the characters down pat. But on hindsight, I realised the only thing I had figured out early is that this is one incredibly thought provoking piece of filmmaking. The Wailing practically roars through the final act delivering all manners of monstrosity and heartbreaking sadness with aplomb. The movie is long and rich, multilayered and satisfying. Prepare to be toyed, skewered, gutted, stabbed and get ready to be played like a violin. I know this review is rubbish and ladened with hyperboles, but I did not exaggerate or embellish, and I did you a huge favour by remaining vague with the plot. Believe me, it is extremely hard for me to do that. I know good films when I see them. It is the great ones that are not easy to decide on. The Wailing is not a great film in the strictest sense but it earns its place on a shelf of illustrious films that invite so many good debates with like- minded minds. These are films that are impossible for you to stay shut-up and have everything explained in a few by-lines. These are films that will never leave your head long after they are done, and when you least expect it the tendrils of the narrative will rise up and wrap around your consciousness like tentacles. There are not many films on this particular shelf and all of them have become classics. I do not use the word ""classic"" lightly, but I believe The Wailing may well prove to be one. You know how I know? The movie left more questions than answers in my mind, but yet it was never a frustrating cinematic experience. It is such a wonderful mindfcuk! The year is not over yet, but I have a feeling I will not see another film of this caliber. Films of this type are rare and such superb rare films wail out to be watched and experienced.

I find myself replaying the movie in my head over and over. I find myself reflecting on the themes that it tries to bring to the surface. Easily, this goes down as one of the best horror movies I've watched. On the second thought, it's one of the best movies I had the pleasure of watching! It's smart, it's clever and it's beautiful! Words that you won't actually use to describe typical horror movies. What makes ""GOKSUNG"" transcend its genre is that it has so many layers but each one is as potent as the other. Like an onion, some audience will walk away only having seen the outer layer but would feel as satisfied as the next audience who was able to see through all its layers. I was taken aback when I read the message boards and reviews where critics and moviegoers weren't actually too sure if they understood the movie correctly. I've read reviews where they view the film as a social commentary between the divide between Japanese and Koreans, others view the film as a genuinely creepy horror movie, others view it from the tragedy that it is, others saw it as a spiritual exploration. And I was thoroughly surprised by this because I didn't see the ending as an abstract one. To me, it left very little to the interpretation. But to better understand this, I had to search through interviews of the director (Hong Jin Na) on what he wants the viewers to take away with them. It helped a lot how the film came to be. He started writing the script of the movie when a series of deaths started happening to his friends/family members. Though he didn't elaborate, he termed the deaths as ""unnatural"" which leaves me to think they were murdered. Grieved with the loss of his friends, he started asking ""why them?"". It brought him to a journey asking different religions to somehow demystify it. This movie was a result of that exploration. In some ways, the movie tries to answer that. Jong Goo, the ""hero"" of the movie, asked the same question several times but there's really no special reason behind it. The stranger did not choose them, it just so happened his daughter took the bait (now think back to the first frame of the movie where the stranger was seen fishing, putting a bait on the hook brilliant!) We often try to search for a deeper meaning into bad things that happens to us. To devout catholics, it's the guilt that it's punishment for sins we have committed. But in the end, we really don't have anyone but to blame but ourselves. It is within our will not to give in to the temptation/bait but sometimes we just do because we don't see through the events that will be set in motion. We often times act in haste thinking our actions doesn't have consequences. The movie forces us to evaluate who brings unspeakable tragedies into this world. Should we blame the devil for laying down the trap? Or should we blame ourselves for being too blind to see it? I think this point was the one that resonated with me: people in this day and age have become desensitized with evil that we rarely think that the devil is real in a physical sense. There's that unbelief in the supernatural that it has no place in our reality. Just like Jong Goo who had heard of (he charged it to village rumours) and seen the Devil (he thought he was a serial killer, nothing more) before but never really understood what he was up against. Several times, he was also given a warning to stay away from the tragic path he was walking into (through his dreams and the most blatant one, to wait for the third crow of the roosters) but alas, Jong Goo relied on what was logical in our reality. It's more logical and easier to believe that our nightmares can never happen in the real world. It's more logical to rush back home when your family is in danger. It's more logical to believe in a religious figure (priest/shaman) than a woman you suspect is a ghost. And that same unbelief is the very tool that the devil uses against us. ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" --- The Usual Suspects This movie is loaded with symbolisms, parallels and commentaries but never once did it hinder the narrative. It even enriched the movie, making three hours seem like two! The director's control over the whole movie is just masterful. To achieve a tonal balance between humour and horror is an achievement by itself but add to that, a movie that works on so many levels this movie is a master filmmaker who understands how to ""talk"" to his audience, what buttons to push to make them think and to make them feel. Hong Jin Na leaves the audience with this: Whatever ideas come to you while you watch the film, they're yours. I want this film to be your own. On the other hand, there is one thing I wish everyone who watches this film to feel, regardless of who they are: a condolence for those who disappeared after having fallen as victims of the world. And for those who are left behind, I sincerely wish this film gives you some time for condolences.",925,98,70,True

The movie runs a bit over two and a half hours, but it actually manages to remain interesting and captivating throughout the course of this time frame. The story is about a strange disease that spreads in a small rural settlement in South Korea. This disease causes rashes and blisters, and eventually drives the infected to kill those he or she loves in blind rage. A local policeman becomes involved in the case and finds himself deep in a very strange mystery, which involves supernatural elements and it is a race against time to find the culprit and the source of this bizarre sickness. I will say that the story is good and interesting, especially because director Hong-jin Na managed to build up the movie in such a way that the audience is given bits and pieces of information throughout the course of the movie, and thus keeps the audience in the dark and trying to put the pieces together themselves and trying to figure out who is the cause of it all. And just when you think you have it all figured out, something happens and the movie takes an unforeseen turn, which just further keeps the audience on edge and trying to make sense of it all. That was a nice thing in the movie, because it kept it from being predictable, and it forces the audience to actually do some thinking throughout the course of the movie. The acting in the movie was quite good, which is a common trait seen in South Korean movies, so there were no surprise there. As always it is an enjoyment to sit down and watch another South Korean movie. Without giving anything away, then I will say that just as I thought I had it all figured out, then the director opted for something else entirely towards the ending, and threw me fully of the trail. I had not seen that ending coming, not by a long shot. But, personally, I didn't care much for how the movie ended and the realization of what was really going on. It was just a bit too much, to far out there for my taste. Especially since the movie had been so good and intriguing up to that point. It just took a nosedive with that unveiling, and as such I am forced to rate the movie only a six out of ten stars rating.

However, by delving deeper into the story's plot, evidences of satire that is related to the second World War and the Japanese invasion of Korea can be seen clearly. At the center of the satire, is the Japanese man who represents the war era Japan that had invaded Korea, resulting in the death of many men, women, and children and the emergence of ""comfort Women"" which was in reality the prostitution of young women and even girls. For instance, the young woman in white may represent the Comfort Women. There is even a a scene in which the Japanese man chases the woman in the jungle. And in another scene, he attacks another woman in an attempt to rape her. There are also other traces of rape and sexual abuse in women. For example, most women seem to have contracted a disease that is somewhat similar to that of an STD that has also transferred into men. And the policeman's daughter's thighs are bruised. Later, she also confesses that she has met the Japanese man. Moreover,the Japanese man's cleansing practice in the waterfall may represent Japan's attempt to cleanse its past, but to no avail. The whole village and maybe even the policeman stands for Korea, and the people are the nation. Nobody trusts the Japanese man, nobody likes him, but no matter how hard they try, they fail to drive him out of the village; he is there to stay and to make sure that everyone is consumed. One by one, the families fall victim to the Japanese man (or the Devil) who fall upon them like a disease. The disease then spreads until it consumes the whole village. Finally, the Shaman is a representation of traitors that allowed Japan to take over the country for their own personal profit.

Both of those are among my favourite films of all times thanks to their breakneck action and intense thrills, whereas THE WAILING is much more old-fashioned, a slow-burning piece of atmospheric horror that's all about the mood and mystique rather than intensity and thrilling action. The film has a rural setting and sees the typically inept Korean police force attempting to make sense of weird deaths and the weird murderers committing them. Before long it becomes clear that an old Japanese hermit, played by yakuza film regular Jun Kunimura, is somehow connected to the deaths. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of sustained horror involving possession, curses, disease, rituals, and even some zombie mayhem. Some viewers might find the slow pace off-putting, but I found this film rewarding right up until the twist-upon-twist climax. It's exceptionally slow and features some stand-out sequences, like the zombie attack and the endless ritual. The performances are neatly-judged and the mystery keeps you guessing right until the end. It's a very interesting film, one made to reward repeat viewing.",204,17,14,True

imdb_the_wailing_myscreenwriter_20170728,The Wailing,IMDb,myscreenwriter,2017-07-28,10,A mystery puzzle,"Impressive mystical build-up. Not only are the characters, the scenery, the acting founded in a story, where people are real. Writer & director Hong-jin Na, gives a powerful view of the dangers surrounding a world of shamans, evil spells, leaving viewers and protagonist Jong-goo (the policeman) in a maze of ignorance, toward a parallel world, only understood or presumably understood by people with special insights. There is an ongoing debate about the conclusion or understanding of the movie, none of them right or wrong, and that is exactly the point, the film offers a view in a world of mysticism, where events can be reversed or take an unexpected turn. The understanding comes with, how you choose to put these events together, giving them purpose. Here is the way I have chosen to put events together, giving some sort of understanding of this chilling drama. (reading on will spoil the fun,if you haven't seen the movie yet) Moving to the middle of the movie, the shaman Il-gwang wants to cast a deadly hex, (death spell) towards the presumed evil shaman, the Jap. Il-gwang states clearly to Jong-goo, that this evil shaman is a master of evil, and that drinking, having intercourse or anything resembling vulnerable behavior, may disrupt the casted hex and make it backfire. In my opinion, that is exactly the key, making events and spells spiral out of control. The father and policeman Jong-goo, can't watch while his daughter screams in agony, while Il-gwang is performing the hex. Going against the shaman's clear instructions, Jong-goo stops Il-gwang in the middle of casting the hex, and the deadly spell backfires. Not only does the Jap survive the attack, but Il-gwang turns evil, thus the result of the reversing hex. Another side effect on reversing the hex, is that instead of killing, the hex is then sent toward the dead corpse in the car reviving it, setting him of as a bodyguard for the Jap (evil strategic thinking) while he is recovering. Once turning the good shaman Il-gwang to the evil side, the Jap secludes himself from sight, by staging his own death, Jong-goo thinking he has killed the Jap in a truck accident. Il-gwang faces the mysterious woman, who now protects Jong-goo's family, and starts bleeding out the nose and vomiting fiercely, he flees under attack until he reaches the boarders of her powers (when the bug hallucinations stop). Back at the house Jong-goo faces the mysterious woman, who tells him not to go back to the house until the rooster has crowed three times. Il-gwang (now in the devil's league) tells Jong-goo not to trust her over the cellphone. The father and policeman losing faith, (impossible for Jong-goo and us for that matter, to see what is what at this stage) returns to his house before the roosters third crow and finds his wife and mother in law dead. Thus, the protecting spell of the mysterious woman is broken (her use and powers now indifferent) giving Il-gwang the opportunity to return and take the pictures of Jong-goo's slain family. Ultimately the movie offers a puzzle, whether you want to solve it your own way or demanding it be solved for you, before you leave the theater, is a matter of temper. For me personally it was a thrill to be challenged by writer & director Hong-jin Na, giving me a lot to think about (thus giving the movie 10). The best part of this puzzle is that it can be solved in many ways, this was just one of many. M.R.",593,20,20,True

Coincidentally after the arrival of a stranger, a strange disease begins to spread in the small village of Goksung, triggering a series of brutal murders. What at first appears to be only crimes of passion just takes darker contours, since all deaths occur in mysterious circumstances. In charge of the investigation, the police officer Jong-Goo (played by Do Won Kwak, known for Ajeossi - The Man From Nowhere - 2010) searches for clues and explanations to the tragic events. When his daughter, Hyo-jin (played by Kim Hwan-hee), begins to feel the strange symptoms of the disease, he has to fight against time to solve the mysterious case and save her life. With a rhythmic narrative, The Wailing presents a folk story associated with Eastern mysticism and also the occultism, marked by elements of mystery, horror and supernatural, as guardians, demons and shamans, and the unfolding of the plot gradually gets more intense and disquieting contours. The technical quality is one aspect that stands out in the movie. The picture and the soundtrack provide an immersive and engaging combination as ambiance, expressed by constant rain, the mud, the precariousness of the small village, the striking features of a small town, as well as makeup and massacre scenarios, consolidate the mystical and eerie atmosphere of the film, expanding the mystery and holding the viewer's attention. The script plays well with expectations, building some characters in a dubious way, without specifying their actual intentions. A relatively simple story is presented in a complex and intriguing way, where apparently scenes with no great purpose show us much, requiring attention to small details, whether occult symbols or religious references (Biblical). Crows and goat's head are used throughout the narrative, symbolizing death and evil omen and referring to the profane and witchcraft. The film manages to build an atmosphere of terror without abusing the typical genre tricks. The moments of humor are used to softer the approach of a subject that in itself is already quite tense. Here it is worth mentioning the great performance of Do Won Kwak in the caricatured role of the lazy, fumbling and fearful police officer, though well intentioned. With a competent job of the cast, efficient direction creating an atmosphere that blends mystery, horror and comedy as well as providing much reflection with an end open to different interpretations and also for its originality, The Wailing is one of the most significant movies within the genre in recent years.",479,24,28,False

It's a Korean film, with some terrific acting and some of the best effects I have seen recently, but what elevates the movie to a special level is its theme and its execution. It is based on popular concepts, yet it will keep you guessing until the very end. It's a tale that will teach you, entertain you, and most definitely scary. It's a thriller with plenty of muscle and heart. The waiting takes you on a long and torturous trip through hell, where a father does whatever he has to do to help his town and ultimately, his daughter. It moves fast and doesn't hold back in showing what begins as the work if a maniac, serial killer, and turns into a mysterious murder mystery with supernatural overtones. The film never falters, even with a brief inclusion of zombies, which I figure is part of the writer's desire to be pretty inclusive in matters if the difference manifestations of good and evil. One will never experience anything but a sense of impending threat and doom. Some members in the audience might feel it's too much but it's all justifiable. It runs over 2.5 hours and one leaves the theater wishing there was more to explain. This would devaluate from the experience because one of the film objectives is to make think the audience go back and look at the clues and turning points, to look into one's own sense of values and want to go back to look at some references upon which the script builds.

Because it has a simple premise that delved into humanity but kept me thinking. And by the end it really did stick with me when I first saw it. This one tries to outdo that film by trying to add bunch of imagery and symbolisms. By meshing a lot of elements the director borrowed from other films that are left ambiguous. But the thing is the narrative isn't up to par and tries to be bigger than what it is. I could tell what the director of this film was trying to do. To keep the audiences guessing and leave things a bit complex. So by the end of it they will be in awe with what is going on and keep them talking about exactly what happened. Now I appreciate director's that don't spoon feed you everything that is going on. It works if the film flows with it's narrative, but this just seemed more complex for the sake of being complex. Like he was trying to make things a bit more ambiguous for the audiences and leave it up to the viewers to comprehend what is going on. Which works in films if everything flows together and isn't forced. But it's like the director took a simple story and made it more complex than it really is and added bunch of imagery and symbolism. So the plot takes plays in a country side rural village. Where weird things start to go down with some of the villagers acting very strangely, saying vile things and becoming zombie like. They think some old Japanese guy is the source of what is going on. When one of the police officers start to look to be possessed they hire a shaman. And thing start to get even more crazy from there on. The thing about this movie is that it's overlong and I think it could have been shortened down to about 2 hours and cut 30 minutes of it out. Because the build up is actually quite boring and things start to get a bit interesting and escalate the tension after one and a half hours in. Which is actually quite long to get to the meat of the movie. I will admit few of the symbolisms and how it comes together is actually quite neat. But as a whole the film seemed to suffer from the issue that arises from the storytelling aspect of things. Overall, it did have some good points with few of the symbolism and re-watching it may clarify certain things but I really don't want to. 6/10",443,22,27,True
imdb_the_wailing_antiraza_20160530,The Wailing,IMDb,antiraza,2016-05-30,5,"Underwhelming story and conclusion, genre mish-mash, some good cinematic moments","I'll provide the dissenting opinion here. (Spoilers follow, because I'm not sure how to articulate my dissatisfaction without talking about the story.) I was a big fan of The Chaser, and went in with high expectations. At the end of this experience, I'm left with many unanswered questions, and not the good kind. Not philosophical questions, not questions about symbolism. Instead, my questions are why we spent so darn long following threads that were ultimately little more than red herrings. Why the first third of the film was just burning time pretending to be a comedy and withholding the main plot? Why did the events in the film happen at all? What was the point of this entire exercise? This is a whodunit with a dissatisfying who, because we don't have a WHY beyond 'crap happens, evil exists, deal with it.' There is also a lot of genre confusion, and while other reviewers have labeled this a positive things, to me it just felt like a bunch of stuff tagged on for the sake of being tagged. Is this a possession/exorcism film? A zombie movie? A conspiracy thriller? A murder mystery? A comedy? It pulls from so many of the tropes that at the end of it I feel like I spent more time trying to figure out what film I was watching that just being able to watch the film. So, a bunch of negative feedback so far, but you'll note I still gave the film a 5/10. Lots of great cinematic moments in here. The locations, design and cinematography are mostly very satisfying. There is one sequence in particular (the major exorcism) that was incredibly compelling. And despite my hate for all the comedy at the beginning of the film being part of the genre noise, it was funny and enjoyable. Also some great performances, in particular from the child actor. Anyway, if you wanted to watch this film because you were a fan of The Chaser, go right ahead, just temper your expectations. It doesn't have The Chaser's palpable sense of dread and power.

Just like in crime novels, the wrong answer kills you, but the right answer does, too, or at least that's what implied by the final reveal. It is interesting to figure out the underlying ethics of the movie, because in horror, it's usually the (lack of) morals that kill. The Wailing, just like Oldboy and another Korean hit, Squid Game, proposes a different scenario. We're all sinners, and even through it's rare for us to kill or steal, at the very least we lie, suppress, or snitch. But our punishment is prescribed not by a hardened hand of a supreme moral deity, but by a bored trickster, who knows that he or she needs no transgressions or obscenities to justify the rivers of blood.

To begin with, the camerawork is pretty good, the countryside and village lovely, even if you can feel a slight lack of budget in the scarcity of different settings that take advantage of the natural surroundings. The little girl's performance is impressive and far superior to the rest of the actors, with the possible exception of the old Japanese man. The rest of the cast are far too over-the-top at times, especially during the ""action"" scenes, which are a tad amateurish and hardly believable (some of the supporting characters roll around on the floor for no reason at all). There's a palpable desire to inject tension through excessive shouting and melodrama. However, this doesn't go down well with the film's rather unpolished pace, which is crammed with one crime scene after another in the first hour, then much slower in the second, with no real justification for it. There's not much ( as far as I'm concerned ) atmosphere here, and I felt very little tension or anxiety. What does not quite work is that the detective aspect ultimately has very little importance for the characters themselves, even if as far as the audience is concerned, we are left in doubt right up to the last minute, but more by the limp mechanical storytelling than by any real thirst to discover the mystery. The long, ecstatic shamanic exorcism scene is worth mentioning, though, as it's a real blast. The contrast between the shaman's showmanship and the Japanese old man's more primordial rite (beautiful white chickens and a team of musicians for the former, rather rustic black chickens and somewhat primitive drum beats for the latter) encourages us to see a duality at work, despite the fact that the ending leads us to understand that the two were in cahoots. Unfortunately, there's far too much inconceivable idiocy (in their choices and reactions) on the part of the characters, and many of the events that unfold only happen because people don't talk to each other, and the role of the angel-ghost girl is literally a bad deus ex machina who only exists because she chooses not to interact with the scenario until she's called upon (and so she lets a lot of people die without any real justification). That said, it's a twist I really like, but the execution is really messy. There are several potential films in this feature, as evidenced by the total absence of the slightly black humorous tone of the beginning, which evaporates completely without having any weapons powerful enough to compensate for this absence, the action being limp and ham-fisted and the horrific side quite non-existent, as the misfortunes fall mainly on tertiary characters, apart from the protagonist's daughter. Despite all this, I don't consider it too long (even if the final scenes are far too artificial in their build-up to suspense), and I was gripped right up to the conclusion. It just didn't stay in the oven long enough, and the main ingredients should have been rebalanced.",520,3,1,True

However the director appears to have been given slightly too much power. Rather than create a gripping, punchy narrative we instead get an arty conflicting narrative with a ""make your own interpretation"" ending. The movie is also considerably too long. I think the movie should have been heavily edited by the producers - it should have been cut down to around two hours. The strongest narrative strand was the one with the female ghost. Parts of the story that conflicted with this should have been altered. The zombie scene for example could have been made to fit with this narrative, it's a great scene though I wouldn't have cut it entirely. Also the photos needed to be explained - maybe the Japanese guy is actually keeping the zombies from returning to life? Then of course we need a punchier ending. I think it was of dubious taste to insert some Christian themes. There was NO GOOD REASON for the guy to trust the female ghost, a couple of Jesus references in no way can compensate for how suspicious she had behaved previously - she had made the shaman spew blood lets not forget (and the Shaman had appealed to Buddha for help). Lead character has developed some courage and stamina and is no longer just a wimp. He flees home to his family ready to crack skulls. Final battles rages, shaman and ghost are both killed perhaps? Priest character shows up from hospital and helps out too? OK, so I hear you say - it wasn't suppposed to be that sort of movie. But the rest of the movie was AMAZING - It could have appealed to EVERYBODY. Entertainment is still what most people are looking for in a movie. It didn't have to entirely make sense, but just make more sense than it did. .... then in a few years from now, the director could have reduced his own two and a half hour cut of the movie with the interpration ending.",352,10,11,True
imdb_the_wailing_kluseba_20161108,The Wailing,IMDb,kluseba,2016-11-08,10,By far the best movie of the year,"''The Wailing'' is easily the best movie of the year 2016. It's at least the best Korean film since the vivid action-comedy flick ''Quick'' and the war epic ''My Way'' five years ago. It's on the same level as horror and thriller classics like ''Memories of Murder'', ''Oldboy'' and ''Sympathy for Mister Vengeance''. I would say that ''The Wailing'' is at least the most intense horror movie since the first part of the ''Insidious'' series six years earlier. Since this movie doesn't get a wider release in North American and European cinemas despite being a massive success at the South Korean box office, I urge you to buy it on BluRay or DVD as soon as you can to experience this unforgettable masterpiece. The story of this mystery and horror film takes place in a remote and rather poor Korean village where a series of strange events occurs. People seem to commit horrible crimes while being under the influence of what seems to be an abominable disease or a weird drug. People kill their own family members, friends or neighbors for no apparent reason by stabbing them to death or burning down their houses among other elements. Local police officer Jong-goo is scared and shocked by those horrible events but grimly determined to uncover the mystery behind those crimes. Despite being initially analytical, grounded and reluctant to investigate superstitious claims that those crimes are related to a mysterious Japanese shaman living in the woods and feasting on raw animal meat, Jong-goo feels more and more confused, haunted and helpless when he can't find any logical explanation for the series of gruesome crimes and confronts the mysterious stranger. Soon after this, Jong-goo own daughter seems to change as she is abnormally hungry, behaves strangely and reacts aggressively towards anyone who is approaching her. Jong-goo realizes that he must solve the mysterious incidents in his village as quickly as possible in order to save his daughter. There are many elements that make this movie so outstanding. One element is the sinister story itself that keeps the audience guessing until the end. Just like the main character, the audience quickly doesn't know what to believe in anymore and the haunting ending only adds to the brilliance of the movie. The movie's strongest key to success is probably its intense atmosphere. Most scenes take places during storms or heavy rainfall which adds to the tension of the film. The fitting locations include dark forests, dirty huts and empty highways. The slow and menacing pace of the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat as it is regularly interrupted by sudden graphic or sinister scenes that feel so shockingly realistic because they aren't exaggerated or overwhelming. A brooding soundtrack, fitting costumes and settings and sinister light techniques only increase the almost unbearably tense atmosphere. Despite an epic running time of more than two and a half hours, this film doesn't have any unnecessary lengths in my opinion. Another winning element is the incredibly detailed work by director Na Hong-jin. Each scene serves a specific character development, an increase of seemingly supernatural and stunning elements or a particular clue to involve the audience and let it put the pieces of the puzzle together. The movie took more than half a year to be made and it really pays off in the end. This film feels incredibly detailed, stunningly acted and perfectly produced. The actors and actresses are all giving the best performances of their lives. One has to point out main character Kwak Do-won who changes from a caring, determined and strong father to a desperate, helpless and impulsive shadow of its former self who is haunted by nightmares and tries to solve his problems in violent manners. It's easy for the audience to identify with this charismatic, emotional and realistic character from start to finish. The supporting actors are just as great because there are many mysteries revolving around them and you never really know whether they are good or bad or somewhere in between. Police officer Jong-goo meets a mysterious woman dressed in white who seems to give him clues to solve the strange murder cases and save his daughter but at certain points in the story, she seems strangely passive and might even try to fool the main character. Jong-goo also encounters a young shaman who seems helpful and powerful at first contact but whose scary rituals seem to harm the main character's daughter more than anything else. Obviously, there is the mysterious Japanese stranger who only communicates in his mother tongue and whose recent appearance in the remote Korean community evokes numerous questions. The combination of an extremely professional director, an intriguing script and story that requests multiple views, a cast consisting of young and veteran actors who put all their heart and soul into their performances, an intense yet realistic atmosphere supported by a haunting soundtrack, scary settings and costumes and gloomy light techniques and a great production that takes its time to develop a perfect pace without any flaws such as shaky cameras or unrealistic special effects make this film a masterpiece of the contemporary art of film-making. If you like mystery and horror movies, there is no way for you to get around this movie. If you were to miss out on this movie, you simply couldn't consider yourself an expert of these two genres anymore. Stop reading other reviews and purchase this film right away.",910,17,25,False

It should've been crisp to a max of 100 minutes. Unclear climax, unmatched or poorly synced background score, not showing the kills in detail.. and a few other flaws.

The cautious reader will notice a large amount of repetition in the wording of reviews, allegedly by different people. The word ""masterpiece"" is thrown around quite a bit and many gave this film a 9 or 10 out of 10. I am here to say that this is not a perfect film as claimed by these reviews. Go ahead. Give this movie half an hour. Do you agree it's a masterpiece yet? If you're worried about unfairly judging it, sacrifice the whole 2-and-a-half hours of your life. If you believe it's a masterpiece as alleged by that point, please post your review explaining why. My issues: * As pointed out by many reasonable viewers on this site, the main characters were laughable - Korean keystone cops! Literally falling around on the ground, screaming and yelling at every opportunity, and just generally doing a poor job. Hello writers - your protagonist has to be relatable and no-one wants to relate to a bumbling fool. * Which reminds me - to preemptively shut up the patronizing racists who gave this movie a 10 out of 10 (!!!) simply because it's Korean / ""foreign"", no, it's not a cultural difference thing. Memories of Murder was a great Korean film featuring cops that suffered few if any of the ridiculous flaws that this alleged masterpiece has. * The movie didn't know if it wanted to be a comedy, action, horror, thriller, mystery, or....anything. Many simple tropes are thrown around, most with no clear resolution. * Uh, The Irishman was too long - and this ain't no Irishman. There is no excuse for dragging this mess on for 2 1/2 hours. Poor editing. * Terrible writing. What was the point of the priest and / or the shaman? Was the villain a Japanese guy just because of racism? What was the real story with the female ghost? Was the kid still haunted at the end? Whatever happened with the dude in the pickup truck? Come on - after giving hours of our lives to this thing at least throw some basic answers our way. Stay cautious. Most critical reviews are trying to warn / help you. The glowing reviews are almost certainly shills or idiots ( 10 out of 10? Really?). Don't waste your time like I did. Yes, this movie delivers on wailing during the movie - there's a lot of it - but you don't want to be wailing AFTER it.",418,112,69,True
imdb_the_wailing_reno_rangan_20161203,The Wailing,IMDb,Reno-Rangan,2016-12-03,8,A father's struggle to see his daughter to get well.,"A new film from the writer, director of 'The Chaser' and 'The Yellow Sea'. This time its a horror-thriller that focused on a rural police officer who witnesses a series of strange events escalating fears among its people. The original title was 'Goksung', which means the name of the village where this story takes place. This film is specially for those who like Korean films. But I'm sure that everyone would enjoy it equally. Very typical Korean film yet an engaging theme and thrilling, particularly towards the final quarter. The opening, and almost the first act were like a black comedy. That does remain same after sometime. Because they wanted to give an impression what kind of person is this story's lead man. He's a cop, but feared of supernatural stuffs. So one day, he gets an early morning call to head where a family was slaughtered by one of its members. In his small village, with a small population, events like this are very rare, but when another similar incident was reported, ruled out what it was considered, but something else beyond humans. After the strange dreams, he comes to know his family too got affected by it, particularly his young daughter. Followed by when it gets serious issue, the family decides to bring in a shaman and so the ceremony begins to free her from whatever possessed. This is where the film turns more aggressive in revealing following event with twists and turns. The rest of the film should be watched to know how it all ends. The first thing was the film length. It was too long, nearly 150 minutes, but the screenplay filled with many enthralling scenes and dialogues. So I don't think sitting for that long would be an issue for most of the people. Surely you will be on your seat edge most of the time on your watch. Good story, but very confusing. I mean not puzzling way, but the events and its characters, especially the conclusion which is not exactly a perfect one with proper detail. So you might look for some clarifications after watching the film. ""If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch? He's just fishing. Not even he knows what he'll catch."" The concept was a little confusing like what kind of horror is this. At one stage there comes a zombie, but it follows right after an exorcism on a girl possessed by a ghost. The writer used the time as long as he wants to develop them. So the narration was slow, but very steady on its direction going deep. If you are good at Korean films, the style they make, you might predict some of the scenes correctly. Like I said the final few minutes might confuse you, but really well done part if you understand that clearly. The film characters wise, I liked how it all connected at the end. But as a story, the solution did not seem right. I think not the fitting one or more convincing. I know who would you root, I mean most of you back what character, so from that perspective, feels it compromised a bit after put up a stern fight with what they had believed. I liked how culturally this story was narrated. I mean as its set in a small village, the ceremonies to fight the evil spirit was conducted traditional way, not the western style, except it opened with a quote from the bible. The actors were perfect, particularly I liked where it was shot. A fine location to mix horror and cop themes. The suspense keeps the film alive, but you won't always looking at that, because the theme expands quite bigger than you expect. There are some unexpected turns, you might find yourself scratching your head for how deep it could go. Don't worry, in the end, it all comes together, or maybe watching it twice could help you with that. As I said the runtime might not favour you for the second viewing. Besides, pay a good attention while watching it for the first time, then you will get everything. Particularly if you are an animal lover, that's a biggest clue you could get in this film. I think it will be one of the best horror you would find around the world this year. It might get remade elsewhere, but the chances are less and it could remain as one of the Korean classics in the line of many others like 'Memories of Murder'. You don't have to be a Korean film fan or this director's, but if you do, surely you will have an advantage in understanding it clearly and like it more than the others. Definitely it is one of the best Korean films, but I don't think so a must see, not according to me. Though I won't conclude my review without recommending it to you. So I say watch it. 7.5/10",826,7,9,False

The devil is something that many acknowledge in all religions and even for non religious people. So the way this film was made and the evil/the devil was presented was very good. It wasn't supernatural or unrealistic, it was so believable to the point it made me think that the devil is not only a spirit, but a liar that can deceive many and change form (from a Christian point of view). The film itself was wonderfully made, it was nice to see another persons perspective on faith and how they handle certain situations. From that kind of background I'm aware in small villages in Asia, there are things that happened like that.

For the first half of this overly long film I was actually praising how well the humor was translating for a foreign language film; during the second half all that praise went away. The film seemed to have taken a turn for the serious but there were several scenes where certain elements were so over-the- top ridiculous that they seemed unintentionally comical. The second aspect of this could just be a matter of viewer preference. The audience struggles with figuring out just who is to blame for the evil plaguing the characters in the film until the last few minutes. This, in itself, isn't so much the problem as is the questioning that arises concerning certain scenes from earlier in the film. One of the unintentionally funny (and seriously overly-drawn-out) scenes from earlier in the film seems to have little-to-no purpose once the true villain is revealed.

I personally love gritty, violent films (especially if they're Korean) and this is definitely one of those. It is not an over the top, in your face violence (though there is that at times littered throughout the movie), it is mainly just the after math of the violence.

I guess the lead should be praised for portraying such an oafish buffoon, but in light of the story (zombies and demonic possession), it tends to grate to the point of masochism. The movie takes itself very seriously, which may cause one to exalt it as something higher than what it is. Ultimately it's a fairly simple demonic possession and zombie movie.

And this is only the beginning, as more and more people in this small Korean town start going mad and killing others (and sometimes even themselves) in the process. He, his partner, and the local priest suspect a Japanese man, who has recently moved into the area, is somehow involved. And when they hear a tale told by the local tonic salesman- about a near-naked man eating from a raw deer carcass in the woods- they are driven to investigate further. They trek out towards the Japanese man's woodland haunt, and find that it's complete with skull-laden ritual chamber, and photographs of everyone who went mad, before and after their murder and/or murder/suicide sprees...which only acts to corroborate their suspicions. But, it may already be too late for the Sergeant. He discovers his daughter has been targeted, and fears for her, and his family's, safety- considering the nature of recent events, and all. This fear is justified when his daughter starts going mad: screaming & flailing; telling off her father with all manner of profanities; and threatening to murder them all. Awaking to a goat carcass with it's entrails hanging out at your front gate probably isn't a good sign either. When questioned about his involvement, the Japanese man simply replies, ""You wouldn't believe me if I told you."" So the Sergeant and his family turn to a local Shaman for help. Hoping they can figure out what is really going on, and do what they can to protect themselves. He reveals, to them, that the suspected Japanese man is actually a ghost- or more accurately a demon...and he's out to get the Sergeant for wronging him. What follows is nothing short of an epic battle of dark vs light, as the two shaman's face off, ritualistically, in an attempt to hex each other to death. But, perhaps things are not exactly as they seem...just when you think it is over... As someone who is interested in Shamanism, I really enjoyed this film! It's quite long at over 150 minutes runtime, but it keeps you intrigued by slowly unraveling the mystery, then totally shifting gears once you think you've got it all figured out.

Written and directed by Na Hong-jin, the movie is a masterclass in slow-burning dread and pacing, gently immersing the viewer into its world building and characters and ramping up the tension and terror bit by bit to deliver one of the most ambitious horror movies of the 21st century. The Plot = A mysterious Japanese man (Jun Kunimura) arrives in the small rural village of Gokseong in South Korea. Soon after an outbreak of mysterious illnesses and killings starts spreading throughout the village. A policeman Jong-goo (Kwak Do-won) is drawn into the incident and is forced to solve the mystery to save his daughter. The movie's lengthy two- and half-hour run-time may be a bit daunting for some, but it never feels overly long or drawn out and uses that time to fully invest in its thought provoking narrative and emotional impact and that's a testament to the great filmmaking and care taken in maintaining its brilliance throughout as it trusts the audience to have the patience to let its horror slowly unravel into something complex and unnerving as opposed to the usual genre fare that throws out jump scares every 10 minutes. The direction by Na Hong-jin is simply phenomenal as he excels at delivering a bold and confident story that's beautifully shot with a dynamic atmosphere that allows itself the necessary breathing room to deliver its serene world and compelling characters before the true tangible terror kicks in. This is a fantastic watch that rightfully deserved all the praise that it has received and while the long pacing may be a bit challenging for some, but for true fans of horror this is something special. The performances here are excellent and helps fill out this world with many interesting and quirky characters. Kwak Do-wan gives a terrific lead performance as the clumsy cop and adds many layers to his role as the movie progresses. Jun Kunimura gives a captivating performance as the mysterious stranger. Hwang Jung-min gives an outlandish and memorable performance as the shaman and Chun Woo-hee adds an ethereal and mysterious presence to the production as the woman in white.

I was wondering if there was a subtext about inter-Asian race relations, but I don't think so. There is also a ""shaman"" featured in the movie - Korean shamanism is apparently a sizeable minority in the country. This isn't explored in much depth, however. There are a couple of things about ""The Wailing"" that make it really dare to be different. For one thing, it's actually funny. The protagonist is a lazy, bumbling small town cop, who is anything but at home in a world of violence, let alone a world of the supernatural. The movie is not screamingly hilarious, but it has a consistently funny tone. The other thing is the focus of the story. Movies like this generally bring you inside the minds of the protagonists; this one is more interested in capturing the essence of this strange, leafy town.

This is a South Korean horror film that doesn't actually reveal that it is a horror film until it is deep into the wilderness of its story. It melds folklore, cultural superstitions and religious mythology to explore themes of faith and fear, and how ultimate evil can be seen as something akin to a virus that infects and consumes, before moving onto the next host. This is a deeply fascinating mood piece that recalls the brooding atmosphere of Bong Joon-ho's 'Memories of Murder' and the enigmatic mysteries of Michael Haneke's 'Hidden', with spectacular scenery as the backdrop to some gruesome goings-on. What starts off like a pretty standard procedural investigative thriller goes through a remarkable metamorphosis across its (fairly lengthy) runtime. In a nutshell: A bumbling but endearing small town cop begins investigating a series of crimes that point to some kind of homicidal hysteria sweeping through his community, and all roads lead to a mysterious stranger who has taken up residence in the local woodlands. That's all you need to know going in and, to be honest, that's all you really know for sure coming out. The story winds its way through to some pretty unexpected and unsettling places, but spends its first half hour setting-up the foundations of an intriguing mystery while also being surprisingly funny, and it is this quirky humour that lulls the viewer into a false sense of security as a result. The comedy soon dies out and the disquiet sets in, plus the authentic performances from the cast keep it all grounded and lend the whole experience a reality, no matter how bizarre events get. There are answers in the film as to what is happening, why it is happening and who is orchestrating things and to what end, but the film has been intentionally designed to obfuscate any sense of certainty. Even when things are being explained, nothing is explained. Even when it feels like we are witnessing revelation, nothing is revealed. Writer/director Na Hong-jin wants us to work hard in order to drink from the well of deeper meaning. He is indeed exploring the notions of evil as a disease, superstition as a science, and faith as simple perception. In fact, he makes the supernatural somewhat prosaic, which calls into question how we are viewing events and how much of it is real, how much of it is magic, and how much is simply allegory and metaphor for the filmmaker's own spiritual discourse. Either way, whatever it all means, Na Hong-jin expertly unravels the tale at a methodical pace, like bait danging on a hook in the water until we bite and he reels us in with expert timing. But, much like a fish literally out of water, it's a bewildering and confounding experience at the end of the line. I am uncertain if the confusion is partly a symptom of the somewhat muddled plotting or if the ambiguity was perhaps an afterthought (the film apparently was in the editing room for a year and intentionally cut out some context), but it doesn't really matter all that much since the overall experience is so spellbinding.

Jong-Goo, our ""hero"" and South Korea's version of Chief Wiggum, is called to investigate a series of mysterious, violent deaths in a rural village. His investigative strategy? Panic, flail, sweat profusely, and blame the new guy. To be fair, the new guy is a creepy Japanese stranger living in a cabin of nightmares with an altar made of goat skulls and a very unfriendly dog. So, like... fair suspicion? The nature of the threat nearly gives you whiplash: it's a haunting. No, it's biological contagion. Hold on to your butts, it's a cult! Oh wait, false alarm, it's just food poisoning. PSYCH! It's the Devil! You feel really bad for our lovable Korean Barney Fife because through all this, his daughter catches Lucifer's Revenge, starts cursing like a drunken sailor, and appears to be possessed by either a demon or the spirit of a very angry theater kid. The family's response? Hire a shaman who looks like he DJs psytrance festivals on weekends and charges by the pill. What follows is an unhinged mashup of exorcisms, corpse reanimations, and dramatic foot chases-like Scooby-Doo, but with more blood and slightly less clarity.

The acting was strong (especially from the child actor); the scenery and both overall setting and specific settings for particular scenes helped set just the right mood at the right time; there was a good dip into traditional local customs; and running alongside the plot were several themes related to important social and moral concerns (racism being the biggest one). A powerful combination. But, what really caught me and held me throughout the movie was the mystery. Multiple characters and events would lead you to suspect the antagonist was a particular person or thing, just before something lead you in a different direction. At many points, you have two or more suspicions and are just waiting to confirm which is right. Thoroughly engaging despite the length of the movie.

After the arrival of a Japanese immigrant, a series of bizarre murders begin to occur, committed by the various townspeople who seem to be under a zombie-like spell. The situation becomes personal, however, when Jong-Goo's young daughter begins to exhibit symptoms similar to those of the murderers. While Japan has been a majorly recognized force in horror cinema, it wasn't until ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" was released in 2003 that neighboring South Korea was really on the map for international genre fans. ""The Wailing"" is a fine addition to the horror canon, and an unexpected one. The first half of the film is marked by wry dark humor and intelligent dialogue, and is at times so witty, you wonder if you are watching a horror film; that is, until you are reminded by violent and disturbing encroachments. The latter half of the film is remarkably darker in tone and spirit, and feels like a through-and-through horror film. While this shift in tone does leave the film feeling a bit odd in terms of balance, the upshot is that you're likely absorbed enough by the mid-point that you're in it for the long haul anyway. Moody cinematography and atmospheric shots of the desolate mountain landscapes give the film a distinguished ominous sensibility, and there are some fantastically gruesome scenes interspersed throughout that give the greatest of zombie flicks a run for their money. The performances in the film are phenomenal and lend the proceedings further credibility. Do-won Kwak's performance as the troubled father/policeman is raw and realistic, while Hwan-hee Kim's performance as his possessed daughter is unbelievably good—in the ranks of Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist,"" as far as I'm concerned. Some have expressed dissatisfaction with the conclusion, which is somewhat understandable; it does leave room for interpretation, no doubt. That said, I think the primary reason so many have felt let down by it is merely because the film is so long—running over two and a half hours, I think many people are expecting a more explosive payoff, which we don't get (nor do I necessarily think we should). The final act is truly disturbing, and is both visceral and spiritual in equal measure. All in all, I was completely absorbed by the world created in ""The Wailing."" Riddled with tension, it burns slowly from beginning to end, with occasional spurts of grotesque violence, and is rife with religious overtones and themes; the acting makes it all the more engrossing. While it does run a bit long, the film never lost my interest, which is rare.

I think I can do this without spoiling. If you don't know what style underpants Japanese and Korean men wear, or which side of the road they drive on, not to mention who gets to cast the first stone or how many times a rooster burps, you might not 'get' this film. Religion is a spongy thing, from Shamans to the resurrected, and from scamming palm readers to the truly omniscient, they all speak and act ambiguously. So there's that. Kudos to start: The Shaman rituals are wonderful and intense, the music is so good. The zombie scene, just WOW, even though it teeters close to ""okay, there's six of us and one of him, lets try to get him one at a time"" dumbness. Kwak Do-Won, like so many of the blubbery Korean actors I enjoy, is great with only a few errors, probably the director's fault. The little girl really does ""bring it"". Jun Kunimura, though problematic overall as the 'Japanese' man, has a couple scenes of such commitment and beauty (the photographers, makeup people, and director get some credit) my jaw hit the floor. One eyebrow raised: Films of subtle depth and substance should also be enjoyable on a superficial level to be great. This film is that, for the most part. BUT. There's a fine line between intentionally misdirecting your audience and being thoughtfully ambiguous. Hong-jin Na is a little wobbly on that line. I think this is the weakest of his three films. The film is edited questionably. There are several scenes that all of a sudden aren't there any more and we're onto/into the next one leaving us to think: ""How did they get out of that one""? This can be an effective technique or a sign that things haven't been thought through completely. This film isn't very fluid, imo. Spankings: In the horror genre, or otherwise, it's disappointing when there's a scary scene that ends up being a dream--doubly so if someone later asks 'Was it a dream?' or says with authority: 'It wasn't a dream'. There's a big scary scene that happens in this flick that just doesn't make sense for it to convert to a dream, unless the guy woke up where he was in the dream. It invalidates what happened right before it and during it. The foot chase. This is a staple of many horrors and others. It's akin to the gun fight: stupid. When a hobbled old man, shown stumbling and falling down, can still outrun six capable, younger men, I'm gonna puke. I might even punt a film based on that, as this makes me lose lots of respect for the film maker and his/her choices. Back to the underpants. I'm sure there are lots of 'tells' in the film I didn't get. Lots of them. But and So, even missing all of them, and even though I ask for an obvious 'tell' if/when the subtleties may be lost, the big obvious 'reveal' in this film is so clumsy I felt a big ""Boo"" well up from inside. I'm on board with a film that might not make sense, might even frustrate while experiencing it in real time, and only reveals its true depth after it's over and you think about it and put all the puzzle pieces together. An example would be *Spider Forest*, a film I totally didn't 'get' while I was watching it, but felt enthused and excited about trying to make sense of it. When The Wailing ended I was glad it was over. Don't get me started on the ""Why is this happening?"" question.

The second act packs in a lot, especially the impressive dance exorcism, and the third act starts with a good zombie fight and does a skillful job of keeping the audience guessing. Problem is some scenes are clunky, where you keep wishing they'd get there already or do the obvious thing or just stop repeating questions. And what were they thinking with the translator scene? Tiresome. In the end I wasn't sure the story had created its own world. The acting is good. Early on the lead was sometimes annoying. But the standout was the daughter - huge charisma when she was happy, chilling when she was possessed. Pace was a bit uneven in the first half, but nice and tight as the climax approached. Editing not too imaginative, and there was no standout image, but the director did well to keep the story moving when it could have collapsed into confusion.

Also a stereotype mise-en-scene of 'Texas Chainsaw' is found in rooms of the Japanese guy. And it doesn't end just yet: the transform of a human to a demon figure reminds 'Evil's advocate' - putting aside the genre of it - and other similar movies. Lastly the taste of Japanese horror films is also added in many points. And zombie is also a part of this orchestra of different kinds of horror, completing the purpose of the director in building such dynamic composition. Few years ago when 'Cabin in the woods' was released it was described as the horror version of a box of chocolate. Now 'Goksung' also reveals a similar sense yet in an apparently different manner.

Organic and nuanced story telling makes the film very grounded, with realistic characters that draw the viewer in. Excellent use of sophisticated dark and situational humour brings levity and balance to the horror aspects which keeps the film refreshingly light at the start. The film cleverly keeps the viewer in suspenseful, enduring anticipation throughout as we experience the mystery of the horror through the eyes of incompetent police officers who seem increasing unfit to handle the chaos unraveling around them. The detectives struggle is to discern what to believe is real and what is superstitious native folklore. The backdrop setting of a quiet, small and old village perfectly platforms the circumstances to unfold as information is scarce and impressionable minds are more easily swayed. We view the film through the lead police officers perspective who finds himself responsible for dead bodies piling up and not knowing why. Sets of murders in such a small time frame and proximity inside the village doesn't seem to make any sense. Cultural differences misunderstood as superstitions and stereotyped fears make a rise within the villagers as the horror becomes increasingly supernatural and familiar in the small community. There is a permeating oppressive atmosphere which becomes very harrowing in parts of the film. This atmosphere reinforces the motifs, reflecting the pressures of the characters and how overwhelming circumstances lead to losing a sense of control which therefore in turn leads to bad decision making. Family concerns further compromise rational thought adding to the drama, making the chaos very personal. The city slicker shaman, the japanese Buddhist and the women in white are all fascinating characters who seem to be pivotal in further driving hysteria within the vulnerable village folk. These individuals conflicting influences are both twisted and humorous but ultimately serve a potentially dangerous outcome as the main character constantly struggles to determine who to trust. The title 'the wailing' cleverly represents the experiences of the characters behaviours involved, reflecting meaning with the motifs in the film. The end leaves a level of ambiguity for both the characters and viewer, this feeling of unknowing is maddening where multiple interpretations could be perceived. What is clear is, the film confronts the issues of trust, hopelessness and a complete lack understanding and agency to have any influence or control over how horrific situations can unfold.",408,2,2,False

It successfully despairs with the sheer awfulness of the nature of evil it portrays, & the brooding village mystery that ensues. Amazingly, director Na Hong-jin's seamless instilling of unpredictable variety of horror tropes furthers the flair of its intriguing & terrifying set pieces, that already features Asian mythology & fascinating rituals. Na also ensures that there is no dull moment, as the storyline's build up entertains with well placed comedy, that relishes on the grounded idiocy of its main cast. As for the film's weaknesses, it's storyline does feature overbearing twists, typical of Korean films. This, unfortunately did not quite work for The Wailing, as it muddles the horror & adds unnecessary plot holes and question marks. Sometimes I guess, straightforward story telling has its wonders. Overall however, with the cinematic elements Na brilliantly weaves together, The Wailing more than justifies its seemingly daunting 156-minute runtime.

If it was split down the middle into two chapters, that would at least allow a breather in between acts. Alright? I've got that off my chest, so we can move on. Because 'The Wailing' is excellent. How is it that this modestly budgeted South Korean horror film, that features only occasional special effects and a cast of actors of varied ages (as opposed to predominantly young and pretty) shows up obscenely financed mainstream Hollywood output as being tired, CGI-reliant and shallow? Perhaps for precisely those reasons. Kwak Do-won is excellent as Jong-goo, a police officer investigating a series of outbreaks of a mysterious wasting disease in and around his village. Various scenes of violently possessed and afflicted characters illustrate this. When the malady appears to affect his daughter Hyo-jinn, he sees the progression of the disease first-hand. Kim Hwan-hee is a revelation as the placid, loving daughter slowly transformed into a shrieking, snarling fiend – afraid of the shaman Il-gwang (Hwang Jung-min) brought in to exorcise her, and snarling accusatory curses at the father who is trying to save her. ""When you go fishing, you don't know what you'll catch. 'He's' just fishing "", to slightly misquote the reply to Jong-goo's wearied wonderings as to why his daughter should be afflicted. As to who 'he' is – we have to assume the worst. And yet even her transformation isn't the worst we see. Jun Kunimura plays the morose hermit who may or may not be behind the witchery, and yet when Jong-goo and Il-gwang dispose of him, the shaman feels that they have done away with the wrong person Evocative and effective use is made of location, and especially the elements. On occasions, the atmosphere looks extremely cold, and when it rains, it comes down in torrents. Director Na Hong-jin conjures up a very convincing sense of violent evil within a small community. My only slight issue with 'The Wailing' is that, after all that time, there is no real ending – which is something I usually don't mind at all, but felt this could perhaps have done with some kind of pay-off. Perhaps a sequel is a possibility We have time to get to know the characters, watch them grow and share with them their harrowing experiences. Productions like this, when they come along, almost re-write the structure of telling an effective story – so much so that, while over two-and-a-half hours is a long time to concentrate on a film, you certainly aren't in any hurry for it to end.",436,4,8,True

While I didn't quite taste the amazingness after watch the movie, the analysis around my head after few days justify the lack of ending. Focus on a village that attacked by mysterious plague; when people suddenly turns crazy and murder his/her family, a police investigates the case while his daughter is slowly corrupted by the plague. My first salutation is given to the main character, the police. He is unlike what we encounter in a horror or any movies that have the zero to hero movement (or stays zero), but this MC (main character) has his own violent and fragile sides that happen in the movie interchangeably. This is usually a character that die first in zombie or slasher movies, but it's until you realize that the police is us, after all. While the presentation feels comedic at the first place, it evolves when the situation becomes more complex. The story is quite intriguing first, because there are many hints and clues you can perceive in many ways. I think this is the strongest point and also the weakest, because each time the mysterious bar arises, the story begins to give more question. Sure, for those who can interpret those hints easily, it's a nice ride, but to be the audience who wandering so many why, the unresolved questions buffer the climax and ending scene excitement. While the narration gives an impression of your standard horror movie, many articles/threads in the net conclude this movie is full of hidden meanings, hence make you more interested. If those meanings were intended by the writer, sure it's works, but I think to staple the symbols into quite a realistic narration, it's difficult to appreciate the movie more. I think it's appropriate to call Mother! which included in my Perfect 10 list, as a comparison. Mother! leaves us in unworldly scenes that make the symbols vivid, as opposed to The Wailing with odd ending and rather unfitting to the nature of the movie. It's probably best if you watch it twice to get all details. For those who loves a Korean horror film with hidden details and lots of mystery, I feel The Wailing can be one of the best choices.

His partner tells a gossip for him that a Japanese stranger (Jun Kunimura) that lives in a secluded house in the mountains would be an evil spirit responsible for the illness. Jong-Goo decides to visit the Japanese with his partner and a young priest that speaks Japanese. They find an altar with a goat head and pictures of the infected people that died on the walls. . Jong-Goo finds one shoe of his beloved daughter Hyo-jin (Hwan-hee Kim) in the house of the stranger and soon she becomes sick. His mother-in-law summons the shaman Il-gwang (Jung-min Hwang) to save her granddaughter while a mysterious woman (Woo-hee Chun) tells Jong-Goo that the stranger is the responsible. Who might be the demon that is bringing sickness to Goksung? Plus Points: 1)Screenplay and Direction: The Wailing is the most disturbing scariest horror I had ever seen.This movie is so intense that I took breaks in between such that I can take some breath.Hong-jin Na's direction is award winning.Unlike so much horror cinema, The Wailing doesn't play a gory game of imagine-ifs.It works hard and with serious skill to make you buy into every last twist and shudder of its bizarre, ambiguous plot, which often comes laced with blackly comic farce.Without any jump scares this movie gives the most chilling experience.It's the kind of premise that could have been, and regularly is, stylishly exhausted in 90 minutes flat. But Na structures his story like a police procedural, filling its slow-bubbling two-and-a-half-hour running time with an entire box-set's worth of intrigue and suspense. Climax twist is brilliant and its ambiguous ending lefts us with lot of questions.The scenes of exorcism and sacrifices are disturbing at their best. 2)Performances: All of them gave brilliant award winning performances.Do-Wan Kwok,Jung-min Hwang are awesome with their career best performances. 3)Music: Background score by Jang Young-gyu is award winning and really helped the movie at lot of scenes. 4)Cinematography: This one is also a award winning work in The Wailing.The locations are beautiful but spooky. Minus Points: 1)Strictly restricted for weak hearts.Even the daring people may find this movie so disturbing. So,The Wailing is the most disturbing horror masterpiece with 2016's best directional work.Kudos to Hong-Jin Na.. My rating 10/10( A Rare Masterpiece in Horror) I dare you guys to watch this movie alone ...I assure you one of the best experiences you will get.",504,4,9,False

The small village is an adequate location for this type of horror, which is mainly centered around superstition and fear of 'the stranger'. The main protagonist is an everyday dad, who's also a police officer, and he's no better being one or the other. He's also the comic relief in this film, in fact, the way he conducts himself and his tone of voice reminded me quite a lot of Homer Simpson, but Korean.

I saw the film just recently and I recommend you to see these two superb films: Gui si (a.k.a Silk 2006) and Noroi (a.k.a. The Curse 2005). Also as an afterthought I recommend you see Dark Water (2002 film directed by Hideo Nakata). Hideo Nakata also directed the cult horror films Ring and Ring 2(1998 and 2005). Also recommend you see Ju-On series of films. Now that all said, we move over to this film. It is about a Japanese man has recently arrived at a little village in the mountains of South Korea, living in a secluded house. A mysterious disease starts spreading among the villagers, causing a rash which precedes violent murderous outbreaks followed by stupor and eventually death. Police officer Jong-goo, who is investigating the case, meets a mysterious young woman called Moo-myeong (""no name"" in Korean), who tells him about the Japanese stranger, and later disappears. Watch the film to find out what happens next... Well-known actor Kwak Do-won plays the central character of the film as Jong-goo. Jong-goo does not believe in ghosts the paranormal etc., etc. But as sinister events unfold before his eyes he is forced to seek help from those who are acquainted with the occult. There are no overly spectacular C.G.I. special effects in this film. Special effects are kept to a bare minimum. The atmosphere and psychological horror are what makes this film special. Na Hong-jin who has already directed the cult film The Chaser(2008) and the highly acclaimed drama The Yellow Sea(2010) adds one more superb film to his career. In ending this review, I must say that this film is not a complete film and I hope to see a sequel film in the future. Thanks for reading, may you live long and prosper.",305,3,6,False

In fact, the movie starts with verses in Luke and ends with the resurrected demon showing his palm with a nail mark, asking the priest to touch and feel him to believe the devil's true form. Wailing (or Goksung) has a double meaning. Goksung is the name of a small town in Southwestern where the director grew up. It also means wailing (In Korean, it has a more nuanced meaning - it is haunting wailing of people when someone dies). Director Na took 6 years to make this film. He even lived with a shaman for two months to accurately reflect their ritual and visuality. It is a complex movie that eludes understanding of many audience both in Korea and outside of it because the director - a protestant - blends a Christian message deeply wrapped in the Korean folk tradition (his previous movie, ""Chaser"" use Christian background contrasted against a serial killer).

Its length, though necessary, nonetheless begins to eventually feel a bit much; plot is a little convoluted, with some elements that are never fully explained, and clarity is offered for others with only one shot of the camera for viewers to discern. Through it all, 'The wailing' is thrilling, utterly captivating - and well worth seeking out. Writer-director Na Hong-jin's attention to detail is entrancing, both in his screenplay and direction. Characters and camera alike have a keen eye, taking in all there is to see - and truly, there's a lot to take in. Set design, props, wardrobe, effects, makeup - at every level the production is dense in its content, and intense, making the narrative look as complete as it feels. Even just the energy clearly put into ramshackle home kept by ""the Japanese stranger"" (Jun Kunimura) is astonishing, and thorough - to say nothing of other locations, or whole scenes. The entire cast is outstanding. Kwak Do-won portrays protagonist Jong-goo in a very relatable, believable way, initially rather bumbling but increasingly stressed and personally invested in the goings-on. Even Kim Hwan-hee, only 13 years old at the time the film was released, is excellent as Jong-goo's beleaguered young daughter, Hyo-jin. All involved perform admirably, giving great life to their characters and building the immersive world 'The wailing' is set in. As a great example of the fastidious marvel of this feature, my thoughts linger on a sequence in the middle of the film in which the camera leaps between three concurrent scenes. At his abode, the Japanese stranger conducts a simple but increasingly fervent ritual. Outside the central family's home, hired shaman Il-gwang (Hwang Jung-min) performs an elaborate, escalating ceremony. Nearby, Hyo-jin, a victim of the strange illness in the village, apparently reacts with alarming violence to one or both of the simultaneous circumstances. It's difficult to succinctly expound on how sophisticated these scenes are in their construction, or the way the shots are so finely oriented, let alone edited together. Again, too, the performances of each actor are simply wonderful. And this is just one instance. Mystery turns to thrills, unease becomes horror, and with every slight turn in the narrative it remains deeply engrossing. It's impossible to divert our gaze from the feature - but it's of such great quality, in every regard, we don't want to, either. The length may be a bit daunting, yet 'The wailing' is an outstanding picture I readily recommend to any fans of the genre it plays in.",425,3,6,False

Humans are already pretty helpless in the face of supernatural forces, but making him this inept was painful to watch at times. The father and his cop friend came off as so clueless in the beginning that it felt like comedy. But in the end, the movie turns into a brutal tragedy. After finishing the movie, I kind of got it. The whole point is to keep the audience guessing who the bad guy is. There are twists and turns, and having a gullible, easily manipulated character helps maintain that uncertainty.

Long review: The only wailing you'll remember after watching this film is your own cry of irritation having just spent 2 hours and 36 mins following a trek-to-nowhere that could have been edited down to a mere short. It's a common exaggeration to say that a movie has no plot, but in this case it's hard to argue. (Spoiler alert) A small South Korean hamlet is invaded by demons (who double as Minolta film camera enthusiasts -- where do they develop their rolls?) undertaking a wanton campaign to slaughter the villagers one by one. Who are these photographic fiends? Why do they ""shoot to kill""? By what supernatural means do they convert the innocent into bloodthirsty monsters? Such basic questions never disturb the imagination of our filmmaker. Instead, the bulk of the movie concerns the villagers' unreasonable reactions to their increasingly troubling plight: e.g. (1) The police find a wall of photos of the mounting victims in the home of the suspected murderer/demon, yet do nothing when the suspect walks in. (2) Zombies attack the innocent only for their friends to defend the zombies instead. (3) Doctors conclude that mushrooms consumed locally for many years are suddenly at fault for patients molting their skin, losing all higher brain function, and biting anything that moves. Alrighty then. After hours of confusion, the question boils down to whether the devil is an aged Japanese man who lives in the nearby forest. Why this should be the denouement of such an overlong odyssey is anyone's guess, but it's a clear reference to the generalized sentiment that Japanese = devils, probably the most overused and least surprising conceit in all of Korean cinematic history. Best to stick with the tried and true, I guess. Technically, the film is a slop-fest with minimal evidence of editing. I would definitely have resorted to fast-forwarding had I been watching it alone; many scenes were the cinematic equivalent of enduring a simpleton windbag use tortuous explanations for the most insignificant conclusions. In one humorous example of the filmmakers' inattention, the protagonist struggles with a decision to accept or decline a phone call, eventually deciding to decline the call BY PRESSING THE GREEN BUTTON. This sort of inadvertent surrealism sums up the movie for me. So why the decent reviews on this site? That's hard to answer. It seems that a certain number of reviewers are just big Korean film fans, and maybe this attachment impedes their judgment. That said, I'm a Korean film fan myself. If you're interested in an infinitely better Korean horror/crime movie, I'd recommend ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong Joon Ho's tour de force dramatization of the Hwaseong serial murders. Now that's a scary film you won't want to forget.",466,58,49,True

I would be very surprised if this isn't the best South Korean movie this year. Director Jin Na takes the audience on an electrifying journey involving ghosts, spirits and the nature of evil itself. Like all great horror films, this one shows how fear builds up from ignorant rumors and gossip as the villagers of this backwater town start to lose their grip on reality. When incompetent police officer Jon-Goo is hired to investigate the multiple murders of man and a woman, he finds the killer covered in blood and shaking at the scene, as though in some kind of trance. He investigates further in his half-hearted way but becomes more and more absorbed. Trying to find a motive for such a senseless crime, he questions the locals. First, someone suggests that the murderer took mushrooms that cause hallucinations. When that idea is pushed aside, someone mentions how ever since a mysterious Japanese fishermen arrived some seriously strange things have been happening in the forest. Such as naked middle –aged men in nappies killing and eating deer in the forest. Then, there is a woman in white who starts appearing outside the police station late at night. It's only when his daughter starts speaking foul language and refuses to listen to him that he realizes he must do everything he can to rid the village of the evil. The corruption of innocence is a horror film tradition dating back to The Exorcist (1972). Director Hong Jin-Na could have watched that film in preparation. Then again, he mostly avoids sudden shocks and prefers to maintain an atmosphere of mounting dread. Originally titled Goksung, which has the dual meaning both of the place, and the sound to wail (which is where the English title comes from). By the time Hwang Jun-Min appears as Shaman to exorcise the presence from the village, we have been led into such a frenzy that we feel we may never recover. After some fairly lacklustre recent films which never delivered their potential (Tunnel, Train to Busan), this film really goes the distance. Fans of Korean films will notice the key stylistic features of Korean films, from cheap barbecue joints where depressed characters down their sorrows in soju; to families all sharing a one-floor apartment and sleeping on the floor. Also present in Korean films are prolonged scenes of characters pouring out their grief by hospital bedsides. There's a great one here where the wife of a man struck by lightning in the forest remarks that hewould have died if he had taken so many tonics. The landscape is in many ways as important as the human characters, and the frequent pull-outs to the misty mountains suggest that such ghosts and spirits have been around since the beginning of time.

Korean writer/director Na Hong-jin turns to horror which has a rather ambitious mixture of police procedural drama, part visceral and demonic horror, sometimes hilarious black comedy with a couple of laugh out loud parts, and finally part socio-theological allegory as you're trying to figure out some of the more difficult and somewhat confusing parts of this clever screenplay which leads to a shocking mystery towards the end. The Wailing opens with Jong Goo (Do Won Kwak) a police officer enjoying his daily job and living happily in his rural home with his wife and spirited young daughter, it seems that life for him could not get any better and he couldn't ask for anything more. But when a spate of brutal and violent murders start to wreak havoc all over this quiet suburb, the media blame wild poisonous mushrooms that have suddenly started growing all over the place, but Jong isn't convinced as he hears news that an elderly man has just moved into the area after spending time in Japan and so he starts to suspect that the stranger is the cause of this mysterious illness. But as soon as he suspects this he starts to suffer from endless nightmares and has feelings of insomnia and his family start to worry as it is ruining his life. But suddenly his daughter becomes heavily ill and he thinks that she is going to die as he has seen the result of what happens when others get this illness so it is his job to seek help as he wants to save her from the brunt of this terrible illness, but he soon finds out that it isn't an illness it is just a possession from a ghostly presence. At the start of the second act he and his colleagues search the house of the elderly man and they find something so shocking which brings a new edge to the story as it becomes a rather bellowing dark thriller, but the investigation goes wrong when he thinks he finds something that belongs to his daughter but she soon denies it in her possessed state. Until Jong seeks the help of Il-Gwang (Hwang Jong-min) the village shaman, unfortunately the film starts to flag a little during the second act perhaps due to the excessive time spent on the exorcism ritual, but it's essential stuff as this is used for setting up a third and final which leads a finale which is both genuinely shocking and ingeniously inevitable, as this will leave you with an unshakeable sense of dread. Na Hong-jin keeps with the traits through and through firstly starting with a scene with Jong and his young daughter and it seems that she has been cured from the almost futile illness which is an odd switch in tone but it's nice to be included, but as the third act continues the thrills and mysterious escalate. Picture a scene: with a beautiful rural family home, and all of a sudden a female ghost dressed entirely in white appears, her talking about your family dying if you go back to them, and then transitioning to one of your colleagues who gets a shock which he will never be able to forget for as long as he lives. Essentially the final act of The Wailing is filled with unencumbered thrills, shocks and terrifying scares which burrow under your skin and never leaves you. Indeed, The Wailing may be a bit long at 2 and a half hours long and has a slightly familiar premise with The Silence of the Lambs as it is filled with thrills, unencumbered shocks and visceral terrifying demonic scares, and by the end this will leave you with a horrible, unshakeable and fundamentally unforgettable sense of demonic dread which you will want to see again and again. It seems that K-horror like The Wailing and Train to Busan is surviving with a trait that Holloywood can never get back again in modern day horrors. VERDICT: Na Hong-jin's horror is a terrifying and unforgettable exercise which burrows under your skin leaving you with a lingering, unshakeable sense of dread that modern Hollywood horrors can rarely seem to muster now-a-days; one of the best ever horrors. 8/10 Terrifying.",758,3,7,False

It started off great - viewers don't really know what's causing this ailment (is it the Japsnese guy or is that just superstition? Is it that weird fungus the cop finds at the first victim's house?). The dreams of the Japanese guy with red eyes is also cool. Again - you could chalk it up to a smal town's fear of foreigners. But then as it progresses, it turns out it IS the Japanese guy, and the main guy spends loads of money on a shamanic ritual to save his daughter, which appears to be working, until he cuts it off halfway thru cuz his daughters freaking out. Here I started to get a bit bored. The plot shifts to just plain superstition and it's no longer about the mystery of finding out the root of the true evil. Let me also say there's a lot of scenes of the cops being hysterical and screaming. I get you're scared, but you're supposed to be the order in this town. In the apparent crescendo of the film, cops go get the (now injured from the ritual) Japanese guy. He gets away... apparently overhearing the man crying about his daughter (you're led to believe he actually feels remorse here), and then is mundanely killed by either accidentally or on purposely running in front of the cop guys truck. Daughter gets better, hallelujah everything appears saved. Pretty anticlimactic after the very mysterious, supernatural beginning. Luckily, here it gets better again. Turns out Japanese man is NOT the cause, he was helping, and it's the mystery woman you suspected was helping earlier in the film that's the real evil. The real denouement ends up being quite good, in the plot twist at the end. So overall, good film. Just loses a bit of its suspense in the middle. Some minor changes could've kept the tension and mystery up throughout. Still great production and effects and overall high-value film. Just wish it added a little MORE scare factor or mystery to give it a 9 or 10.",369,0,5,True

Most will find it off putting and I admit I too at times find it rather off putting. But once you get past those moments early on in the movie (an epic 2.5 hour runtime), you'll be rewarded with one of the year's best films! * The movie is all about the foreboding sense that something sinister is coming. Numerous scenes tease this feeling and it's simply bliss. Characters interact with the antagonist early on and you know it's a mistake that is sure to have consequences. It's refreshing to see this type of structure. * ""The Wailing"" is one of the best movies of the year. Period. It features one of the best exorcism scenes of all time, mostly thanks to a cultural difference (coming from outside the USA). The movie leads you in one direction only to pull the rug out from under your feet and throw you in a new direction. It's a movie that keeps you guessing till the final frame, never letting you get too comfortable trusting any specific character. The deceit and misdirection in the movie is simply brilliant! *** An impressive 9/10 (only negatives are those 'silly' comedic relief scenes that feel completely out of place at times) ***",234,3,7,False

It certainly keeps you guessing, right to the end, and the solution could just as easily have been biological as spiritual. It does end well, and is satisfying. Not so satisfying are some of the plot holes and the way Koreans interact. The main man is abused by his superior, and he in turn abuses his junior. That was totally unnecessary, didn't work as humour and didn't help you identify with the hero. It's also hard to understand the cultural difference. First there is the language, which seems to use a lot of words sometimes for a quick reaction, or barely a sound for whole sentences. Also culturally it is hard to place the little village where the action takes place. On the one hard there are advanced police techniques and a well-equiped modern hospital, where on the other hand people seem to prefer rumour as truth, shaman magic and acupuncture and herbs to remedy their ills. A small child at one point has an extreme rash over half of her body, yet the hospital doesn't think it warranted to keep her in overnight for observation or further tests to find out what's wrong with her. Many conversations seem unfinished. OK. It's a Korean movie, and thus you expect all the characters to be quirky and garrulous. Even so, there's a lot of unnecessary swearing and odd reactions. As horror it's kind of bumbling, but also kind of original. The cinematography was terrific and that's what really got me through the two hours.

Most of these elements are in this movie too. But not the way you have seen it nether the way you want it nor the way you thought you would get it.

Hold on , upon further investigations he finds that this killing is may be reason of magic mushrooms that is creating hallucinating effects on the people who consumes it. Pretty soom more caes like this is being reported. He gets informed by a homeless village woman that this is may be doing of a outsider who is practising black magic on the villagers. He and his assistant decides to make a trip to the house of this outsider without any warent only to find pictures of more people who may have been killed their familes and evidence of black magic rituals , meanwhile his daughter also gets sick and starts exhibiting the agreesive symptoms. He calls a Sherman to get rid of the evil spirit that is residing in his daughter's body and also decides to confront the outsider with other villagers.

This movie doens't bombard you with the definition of horror but makes you ask questions about the true nature of the luming horror shown in the movie, tells you a story of a father's affection to his daughter and his willingness to sacrifice everything and be able to do everything even if its a sin to protect his daughter. The chemistry between the lead Kwak Do-won as the father and the lead and Kim Hwan-hee as the daughter is one of the most memorable on screen father-daughter chemistry protayed ever.

This film is a big fail on two levels: first it needs some serious chopping in the editing room. At least 30 minutes of tedious shamanistic drum beating and moronic cop antics could have been left on the cutting room floor, and the movie would have been better because of it. Second, the plot makes no sense either way you look at it. We are given two potential culprits behind the mayhem in the village resulting in zombie-like symptoms in the ""infected"" citizens. Two possible antagonists, and by the end, we still are left with two possibilities. But neither one makes much sense, in the context of the film's narrative. If mood was everything in assessing a horror film's quality, The Wailing receives a B+ in that category - when the scenes don't include the Keystone Cops crying like little girls, or long closeups of people paralyzed with fear, staring in horror at bloody carnage. But making viewers endure 2 1/2 hours of suspenseful buildup without providing a sufficient climactic payoff is unforgivable.

Every off-beat, funny moment like the convo about adult diapers, the side eyes from his family when he's having nightmares, the fight with the zombie where they kept fumbling. Also love me some hijjnx and Asian movies love to include some kind of odd, funny scene that cuts the tension (The Host, As The Gods Will, Ichi The Killer) The crows, multiple healing and spiritual traditions. The ritual duel was dope, intense and well done. Not mad at the runtime. That daughter child actor came to act okay!! - Cons maybe: The ending got a little confusing for me but I think if I were to watch it again it would put all the pieces I learned at the end together. Was the demon and the other shaman working together like disciple and master (hence the diapers) or just the same being showing a different body at different times? Unlikely because why would the Japanese older version be battered and bruised hiding in a cave when he coulda just switched around? Was the lady in white actually good and keeping the bad spirits away? Because in the time that homeboy ran through the spiritual barrier to the house the girl didn't have the time to cut up her family so was she slicing while the lady spirit delayed him? Reading up on it after answered my questions but if you had these questions too you are not alone. - I rate this a 9, for all the positives I mentioned, it surprised me, kept me along for the mystery, and that little girl was murking people which is usually a taboo in film. Kids are to be protected but nah, they gotta stay away from her. Would recommend✨",364,1,1,True
imdb_the_wailing_fciocca_20210703,The Wailing,IMDb,fciocca,2021-07-03,6,NULL,"A movie full of twists and turns, a different take on the whole exorcism genre. Confusing and unsettling ending. ""The Wailing"" is a different take on the whole exorcism/possession kind of movie. I enjoyed the character development of Jong-Goo, a policeman of a small town that suddenly has to investigate some serious crimes and does not know how to approach the whole situation, as he is not used to handling this kind of work. This is where the most ""comedic"" part of the movie comes into play, which was okay, but at times a little bit cringey. I mean, seeing some policemen acting like scared teenagers is not for sure pleasant, or believable. The film gets better when these mysterious events directly hit the policeman's family, therefore we have a complete change of his behavior. At first I thought that this was a slow burner, considering his length, in reality it is very adrenalinic and dense with events. The more you watch it, the darker it gets. There are a lot of explicit and gruesome images. ""The Wailing"" kept me on the verge and I always wondered what was going to happen. Nothing is granted, because there are so many plot twists, maybe even too many. By the end, I had a lot of questions that never got answered. Who were the good guys and who were the bad ones? Were these events some sort of conspiracy between different evil entities that decided to take over a village or if there was in fact someone trying to save these people? I love movies with open endings, because I can give my own interpretation, but this leaves just too many unresolved points, and it is unsettling to me. However, the script is well written, it is just not as straightforward. I am pretty sure that to fully understand it, I need to watch it more than once. The photography and cinematography are really nice, locations are stunning. ""The Wailing"" is a pleasant surprise that with a better thought ending and perhaps with the cut of some useless and cringe worthy moments, could have been easily 7 or even 8 stars out of 10, but this unfortunately is not the case.

imdb_the_wailing_samthebestest_20240203,The Wailing,IMDb,SAMTHEBESTEST,2024-02-03,7,Gives a much-needed boost to the horror genre it has been missing for decades,"The Wailing (2016) : Brief Review - Gives a much-needed boost to the horror genre it has been missing for decades. The horror genre was set in the 1920s, and almost everybody copied the same formula of ghost/evil spirit/dead soul and sin stuff, excluding a few horror comedies that have created a sub-genre of their own since the early 1930s. Modern films in the 1960s went with zombie theories, exorcism, the evil dead, supernatural stuff, and paranormal activities. It has all been seen and pasted again and again on the wall. As a movie buff, I was fed up with watching the same thing in every movie, with a new cast, a slightly different setup, and new directors. The Wailing was looking similar too, but that was before I watched it. Now, I can say that I have finally seen something new in the horror genre, besides the regular ghost stuff. Yes, the main context of this film is based on the same old ghost and zombie stuff, but the film has multiple layers of story-telling that make it different. Firstly, it has that Korean touch of reality and brutality. Secondly, it is terrifying, frightening, and chilling-the basic ingredients you seek in a horror movie. Now coming to the third best thing, and it's the best amongst all, and that is, the film has an intelligent narrative structure with tremendously thrilling suspense. You keep getting your twists even in the last 10-15 minutes, when things are looking stable and you think that you have understood them. Amidst all, it continues with its shivering experience, and there is no faaking boring old-school-older-college 'happy ending' there. That's been the most impressive part here. You know, in almost every horror movie, we see the man or god defeating the ghost, and the story gets over in the same old-fashioned way, but here, The Wailing has a new, willing-to-live attitude. It sets a nice example for the future of the horror genre. A bit of an untidy ending frame and 15 minutes of extra runtime-excluding that, it's a mind-blowing experience.

There is an implication (or direct accusation) that evil is targeting this one man because of his sin, but it hits lots of other people before it touches him.

imdb_the_wailing_bear_adam_20170206,The Wailing,IMDb,bear_adam,2017-02-06,10,A Horror Film Tour De Force.,I will start off by saying that Korean Films are by far my favorite films and though I haven't seen every single one the ones I have seen have been cemented into memory as Masterpieces. The film is directed by Na Hong-jin and this is the first movie I have seen of his but his third major directed film. The story centers on a village that is being plagued by sickness and running rampant with heinous crimes. The main character who is a cop is trying to find a way to stop what is going on as so to save his daughter. The acting was excellent with Do-Won Kwaki who plays the cop Jong-goo and Hwan-hee Kim playing the daughter Hyo-Jin. They do a great job and so do all of the other cast members. The one thing I have come to love about Foreign films especially Korean ones is how much raw emotion and talent they can portray in a movie with actors I know nothing about and that they can pull you into caring deeply about these people. I also like how the cops aren't Americanized. I mean as someone who is an American citizen the cops are portrayed as militant and bullies to a degree and here they are portrayed as docile being that they have no real weapons and being in a small village and they're not prepared to handle what is going on with the current state of affairs. The action is invigorating. I mean the heart of this 2.5 hour movie is a straight tension filled drama with some very well crafted action scenes but don't come into this movie thinking it's a John Wick or even close. I would say think the movie Seven. The cinematography is gorgeous with each shot being meticulously edited and put onto film. The locale is beautiful and makes you want to re-watch it again just to feast your eyes on it for a second time. I will conclude with saying that this is definitely in my new favorite Top 10 horror films of all time and as someone who is a horror fanatic like myself that is a bold statement. I'm glad I didn't review this movie immediately after watching it but waited about a day because the ending will make you side one of two ways obviously and at first I didn't like it. I waited and read some remarks on google about the ending and came up with my own theory. The movie has an Inception feel to it and I will leave it at that but I can say you don't want to skip this film. I find it to be fresh and tasteful and worth a watch at least once. Don't let not liking to read subtitles waylay your interest.

The ending will no doubt leave you a bit confused, as it appears there's been more than one demon all along (or at least an apprentice) but this is not made very clear. A second viewing might solve some of your unanswered questions. I must admit I found Do-won Kwak's acting almost lazy. Maybe this was the story's intention to have him look incompetent, but his character as a policeman was not very credible. The police in general seemed clueless and inexperienced and that was a bit of a drawback for me. When they found all the evidence at the Japanese man's home, they simply left and did not even attempt an arrest or brought him in for questioning. That was just not believable. They also too easily believed gossip instead of evidence, and the whole investigation back story was a lackluster effort, to say the least.

imdb_the_wailing_piccostefano_20240212,The Wailing,IMDb,piccostefano,2024-02-12,7,A haunting journey through folklore and fear,"Na Hong-jin's 2016 South Korean horror film ""The Wailing"" is a sophisticated and unsettling examination of supernatural evil and human frailty. With a runtime that stretches over two and a half hours, the movie meticulously constructs a narrative that is as much about the horror of the unknown as it is about the terror of our own actions. The movie follows a bumbling police officer named Jong-goo as he becomes entangled in a web of suspicion, fear, and antiquated superstitions in a small village where there have been a number of grisly deaths and a mysterious illness. The cinematography is exceptional, capturing the haunting beauty of the Korean countryside while also framing the chilling sequences of horror with a deft hand. The eerie soundtrack and sound design further amplify the atmosphere, immersing the audience in the palpable sense of dread that pervades the film. The performances are strong across the board, with Kwak Do-won delivering a compelling turn as Jong-goo, the hapless protagonist whose initial skepticism and comic relief gradually give way to desperation and fear. The supporting cast, including Hwang Jung-min as a shaman called upon to exorcise the evil and Chun Woo-hee as a mysterious young woman, contribute to the film's dense layering of mystery and folklore. However, the film's ambitious scope and intricate plot can sometimes be its downfall. The narrative is dense with symbolism, cultural references, and multiple plot threads that can be challenging to follow, potentially alienating viewers unfamiliar with Korean spiritual beliefs and folklore. Additionally, the film's length and slow pacing might test the patience of some audience members, leading to a viewing experience that feels overly drawn out at times. ""The Wailing"" excels at building a foreboding atmosphere and delivering shocking moments of horror, but its complexity and ambiguous ending may leave some viewers frustrated. The film demands attention and patience, rewarding those willing to engage with its layers and withstand its unsettling journey into darkness. In summary, ""The Wailing"" is a visually striking, atmospheric horror film that combines elements of mystery, folklore, and supernatural terror. It offers a unique and thought-provoking experience for fans of the genre, though its dense plot and slow pacing may not be for everyone. This movie scores a 7 out of 10 for its ambitious storytelling, strong performances, and its ability to evoke a deep, lingering sense of unease, despite some narrative excesses that detract from the overall experience.",402,0,0,False

Why people don't like it: -No jump scares, doesn't fit their definition of horror in the way they want it to. -""Nothing Happens"" This is the kind of thing that immature people who don't have empathy for human emotions will say. -It left them feeling sick/bad. This film is not fun to watch, it doesn't make you feel good in the way that the conjuring makes you feel good. People will easily mistake feeling disturbed as a sign that the movie was bad. My Opinion: 9/10 This film ruined me. This is the only film that has brought me to a sweat since The Shining. The music, cinematography, acting, editing; created an extremely unsettling tone throughout, I was never relaxed, I was never comfortable. How could anyone be comfortable watching a family fall apart at the hands of a Satanic Cult? This movie pushed me to my limit. Similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, the story is continuously changing, remaining unpredictable all throughout. Both Ari and Alfred killed their main characters early on in their films, causing the story to take a dark turn. This is really a hit or miss, it either breaks you, or just isn't your thing. And that's okay if it isn't your thing!",459,258,93,True

HEREDITARY is most compelling when the horror comes from the awful tragedy of the young girl's death or the emotional hell the family goes through in the aftermath, blaming one another.

I was intrigued by every character and emotionally moved, especially by the mother, Annie. This horror film had its weight established in the very first scene all the way through to its rather unorthodox ending. It felt like you could never get a deep breath in this movie. Every tragedy compounded onto one another in such an easing way. Annie's deterioration due to the grief of her dead abusive mother and daughter was fascinating. The dinner scene where she screams at her son for killing their child was heart wrenching. Every step of the way I was always wondering what next event would be their mothers snapping point. Then the movie concluded and it was a demon possessing the family all along. The plot that I fell in love with was the intricate and complicated relationships between the family. Learning that a lot of the tension derived from an outside force was disappointing. The name of the movie was 'hereditary' and through my investment I wanted the horror of the movie to be found in how dangerous their relationships with each other are. While disappointed with the cult at the center of the family's heart, I could never fully hate this movie for its brilliant acting and expert cinematography.",222,84,33,True
imdb_hereditary_ccamp89_20180608,Hereditary,IMDb,ccamp89,2018-06-08,9,Showcases what horror is capable of when taken seriously,"In many ways, Hereditary is the horror movie I've been restlessly waiting to see for so many years. Despite my avid fandom for the genre, I really feel that modern horror has lost its grasp on how to make a film that's truly unsettling in the way the great classic horror films are. A modern wide-release horror film is often nothing more than a conveyor belt of jump scares strung together with a derivative story which exists purely as a vehicle to deliver those jump scares. They're more carnival rides than they are films, and audiences have been conditioned to view and judge them through that lens. The modern horror fan goes to their local theater and parts with their money on the expectation that their selected horror film will ""deliver the goods"", so to speak: startle them a sufficient number of times (scaling appropriately with the film's runtime, of course) and give them the money shots (blood, gore, graphic murders, well-lit and up-close views of the applicable CGI monster etc.) If a horror movie fails to deliver those goods, it's scoffed at and falls into the ""worst film I've ever seen"" category. I put that in quotes because a disgruntled filmgoer behind me broadcasted those exact words across the theater as the credits for this film rolled. He really wanted us to know his thoughts. Like similarly fantastic and crowd-displeasing horror films of the past few years, The Witch and It Comes At Night, Hereditary is a film that largely deals in atmosphere and emotional horror. The Shining, which happens to be my favorite horror film, is a clear touchstone and I would go as far as saying that this is the first modern horror film I've seen that genuinely captures a similar tone and ethos. Much like that film, it delivers its horror through an intensifying sense of unease and dread that becomes nearly suffocating by its conclusion. Rather than startling you with cheap scares, it offers haunting and upsetting images which are often delivered without any of those overused sonic jolts. Perhaps most importantly, it anchors everything in an emotional core with nuanced characters who experience relatable family struggles and grief. And that is absolutely critical to what makes the movie effective and resonant: it works on a metaphorical level, using the supernatural story as a vehicle to explore the very real way in which a family can be absolutely ravaged by tragedy, and furthermore how trauma and mental illness are passed through the generations. I'd be remiss not to mention that Toni Collette gives a mesmerizing performance in this film that is absolutely unhinged and truly difficult to stomach at times. For all that praise and as excellent as I think it is, Hereditary isn't quite a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I was very much invested and riveted throughout the length of the film, there were some detectable pacing issues. I feel conflicted in saying that because I'm very much a fan of the slow-burn horror style which benefits from a deliberate pace, but I did get the occasional nagging sense that things could've been tightened up just a tad without losing the effect. Some of the scares in the film, often the more ""traditional"" horror moments, also struck slightly the wrong note with me on a first viewing and were just a hair too campy or on-the-nose given how visionary and restrained the majority of the film is. And in its ending few minutes, the film really shows its full hand when a bit more ambiguity may have served it better. The positives far, far outweigh the negatives here though and Hereditary is ultimately a remarkable debut horror film which showcases what the genre is capable of when it's taken seriously by a talented director. Here's hoping we'll continue to see more like it. Light 4.5/5",642,1,437,False

It was all about weird family dynamics and the unseen. I liked that, even though I didn't know where this was going. It was promising. This culminated in one gruesome event. Afterward, the movie devolved (IMO) into a waste of my time. It was too slow and it seemed like the creators didn't know where this was leading to. If the movie had done something with that promising start, my rating would be higher. As such it is, my rating is just 6 our of 10 and the latter part of the movie is definitely worse than 6 stars. Yeah, it's all explainable, but it was not scary anymore, except for that school scene (possession). That was well done. There were too few scenes like this. Watch Rosemary's Baby for a much MUCH better film about sort of similar stuff. The daughter looks really weird and out of place and people would react to her differently than they did in the movie. Examples are the school party and that stuff with the pigeon in the schoolyard. The son and daughter also looked in no way like each other, even though they're supposed to be family. Maybe that's just me. Whatever. It's just a movie and in the end not a classic. The relationship between the father and mother is also crazy and to me looks unrealistic. It had not enough depth.

imdb_hereditary_jtindahouse_20180606,Hereditary,IMDb,jtindahouse,2018-06-06,7,Almost works better as a drama than a horror,"'Hereditary' is sort of like two films in one. Half of the time it is being what I expected it to be, which is a horror movie. The other half though it plays out much like a drama. I would even suggest it's a better film when it's in drama mode than it is when it's in horror mode. The film is over 2 hours in length which is extremely long by modern horror movie standards. The reason I believe for this is that it's trying to fit so much in and achieve so much in such a little time. It's a very ambitious film it would have to be said. The entire cast were terrific, but Toni Collette absolutely blew me away. The emotional depth she is able to achieve never ceases to amaze me and she is captivating to watch in any scene she's in. I feel like she is one of the most under-appreciated actresses working today. As mentioned though, everyone is terrific and this is one of the best acted horror movies you are likely to find. I sat in the cinema for a couple of minutes are the credits rolled just trying to work out how I actually felt about the film. I know I liked it, but I also know I didn't love it as much as I had hoped to going in. It certainly surprised me that I was more invested in the real-life drama side of things, and that the horror was almost like an unwanted distraction at times. The horror is almost always about atmosphere and visuals rather than any kind of jump-scare which I always like. What I didn't like though was how casually it jumped from seeming normality to outright suspension of belief. I feel like this could have been bridged a little better. Early on there's a lot of subtlety, then in one scene all of that is thrown out the window at once. I suppose at least the audience knows where they stand from that point onwards. 'Hereditary' is a film made with impeccable quality, of that there is no questioning. In fact it's made so well that I would suggest what story you picked to tell almost wouldn't matter because writer/director Ari Aster clearly has the skills to make it work. I can see opinions being very divided on the film (I even had a couple walk out of the cinema at one point in my showing), but I think the majority will like it on some level and for that reason I would recommend giving it a look.",433,370,245,False

It is these moments that are the most effective as they tap into a universal fear and experience in a really realistic way that isn't necessarily used to frighten but is used to create emotional attachment to the characters and may perhaps illicit a genuine emotional response. Yet, I can't easily name another movie that falls apart so heavily thanks solely due to its ending, which intends to 'pull the rug out' from under its audience - and does so successfully - but comes at the cost of logic, investment and, most importantly, scariness. Instead of recontextualising the flick as one that embraces its new elements and intended reading in retrospect, it forces in nonsensical and previously unconsidered elements - via clunky exposition, no less - to frustrating, and sometimes unintentionally funny, effect. It honestly changes the entire affair for the worse, dampening the effect of all that came before it until the memory of any success all but fades. It's annoying, too, because the potential was there and I was definitely willing to put the effort in, eager to delve into the experience with an open mind and a watchful eye. I found my willingness to approach the film from an intellectual stand-point, as well as to give it the benefit of the doubt on a number of occasions, not to be rewarded, to say the least.

Instead of scaring you right away, the film slowly takes its time to build a bone chilling atmosphere and genuinely get under your skin. Hereditary uses its isolating cinematography, tense dialogue, and bloodcurdling soundtrack to quietly whisper to you that something unspeakably horrifying is bound to befall its cast of characters. The characters themselves are all impeccably acted and written to feel like real people. Each of the characters have their own multi-layered fears and traumas that they attempt to deal with throughout the story. The film explores how a family can slowly be driven apart through grief and tragedy as well as the horrific consequences this can have on the lives of each of the family members. These themes are conveyed through palpably uncomfortable dialogue between characters and the raw, visceral acting performances of the film's two leads Toni Colette and Alex Wolff. While Hereditary is slow paced, the unrelenting tension and dread present within the story as well as the mystery behind what exactly is going on are enough to keep you thoroughly invested. The second and third acts of the film are truly terrifying in a way that few films can hope to match. The ghastly imagery and scare sequences are so nightmarish that they are capable of staying in your head for days after watching the film. The characters feel so real that it is as if you are watching real people having their lives being torn apart. Overall Hereditary is not for everyone and isn't an easy movie to watch. It is very clammy, unnerving, and disturbing. But if you are looking for a well written and mature horror story that grounds its terror in human emotion this is the movie for you.",309,40,13,False

Toni Collette is fantastic as is no surprise at this point in her career. All the performances carry their own, including one I was unsure of at first but grew on me throughout -- Alex Wolff.

Although more polarising with audiences it was very positively received films critically, having more than once seen and heard it described as one of the year's best. Despite reviewing it only now, 'Hereditary' was another film viewed weeks ago but with so many commitments and such a big to watch and review list it's taken a long time to get round to reviewing it. While the polarisation is understandable, count me in as another person who was really impressed by 'Hereditary', very nearly loving it even. Of my recent 2018 viewings, it definitely stands out as one of the better ones and it is not hard to see whether it is considered in as high regard as it is. Can also see why it has been compared to 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining', having just as much the same amount of dread and hellish atmosphere, and also couldn't help thinking of another slow-burn horror from this year that divided opinion but was also critically acclaimed 'A Quiet Place'. Not in concept and they're different films, but in that they're polarising but mostly positively regarded and both films that were very well made, well acted and unnerving. It is hard to know where to begin praising something with so many positives. 'Hereditary' is incredibly well made visually, one of the most audacious and best-looking films in the genre in recent years. The photography is both dream-like and nightmarish, while the film is slickly edited, atmospherically lit and the spacious house, with a mix of the audacious and the ghoulish, is like its own character. The music is haunting and adds to the unnerving atmosphere as does some of the most effective sound editing and design of the year, never being obvious or cheap and providing a lot of eeriness. The writing flows well and never becomes corny or overly-wordy, sometimes even thought-provoking in particularly in what it has to say about grief and trauma. While a deliberate slow-burn for me 'Hereditary' was not dull at all, helped enormously by the atmosphere and the near-perfect balance of family drama, which was often very poignant and packs a powerful emotional wallop, and horror, where there is not any over-reliance on predictable horror tropes and cheap scare tactics and actually was frightening and suspenseful. It always is interesting seeing film debuts and there are some fine ones out there, Ari Astor's directing is remarkably well accomplished with a fine eye for detail and an adeptness for how to pace such an atmosphere. Characterisation-wise, 'Hereditary' is quite compelling and there is a realism to it. The performances are near-perfect, with Gabriel Byrne occasionally slightly under-playing but generally it is one of his best performances in a while. The star here is Toni Collette in a truly marvellous and often moving turn that calls for a mix of grief and terror, Collette grieves with pathos and conveys terror with intensity. Alex Woolf is the other standout for similar reasons though Milly Shapiro is not to be neglected. It is a shame that the ending is rushed and that plausibility loses its way at this point, instead coming over as silly and like the film had run out of steam. Otherwise, a very good film that was very nearly excellent. 8/10 Bethany Cox",580,118,58,False

However, the movie also has very creepy moments, especially towaeds the end that turn out a perfect blend between suspense and scare. My favorite scene in the movie is when Alex Graham comes home after accidentally decapitating his younger sister, Charlie Graham, in an automobile accident. He is left is complete shock after her death and does not say a single word for the new few minutes. Its a slow segment through the movie, but the silence that is presented really demonstrates the scared and damaged emotional state Alex is left in. He gets into bed, dreading the next morning where his mother, Annie Graham, will inevitably find her daughter's headless, decaying body in the back seat of the car. You don't even see Annie's reaction to the body, but you can hear the horrifying screams and cries she lets out when it all happens. What would usually not be scary in other movies, is absolutely heartwrenching and disturbing in this movie. Towards the end of the movie, it shifts into a dream like state, or nightmare I should say. Alex is awaken and finds his father, Steve Graham, dead and burnt to a crisp when Annie reveals herself possessed and chasing after Alex. The best shot in this sequence by far comes from the headbanging scene while Annie is chasing Alex. Alex runs to the attic, shielding away from Annie, when you hear this loud and rapid banging, which you assume to be a hand or foot, which wouldn't be very intense However, this assumption is turned into pure nightmare when it cuts to Annie, floating below the attic door, banging her head against it at an inhuman like speed.

It became predictable. Some of the effects were great but it didn't hit the way it should've because I'd already called it. I found myself counting down to the ""jump scares"" (that weren't jump scares in the classic sense so kudos for that but still just as predictable) and just waiting for the end, which was very anticlimactic.

And I did at first. The beginning starts out strong with a look into a quirky family and a rather shocking event I was neither expecting or comfortable with (this is a good thing). The following 40 minutes after this event were tense and uncomfortable and the movie appeared to be going the route of a psychological horror/thriller. Unfortunately around the hour and a half mark, the train started wobbling and by the end had gone full blown off the rails, killing many, and leaving me thoroughly unamused and feeling like I'd been cheated of a real ending. This is where spoilers come in: stop reading if you intend on seeing the movie. Shortly after the little girl is decapitated by a power line pole we're shown the grief of the mother and the emotional weight the son carries as a result of the accident. This is quite possibly the best and most uncomfortable part and is littered with meltdowns and what seemed to be mild hallucinations which led me to believe this would be psychological. However, after this, things going the way of the witch in an head shaking manner (which I suppose in hindsight you could have seen coming from a mile away) with the mother meeting a suspiciously friendly medium who performs a seance for her and tells her she can do the same to talk to Charly. As one would expect things go eye rolling, face palmingly poorly and things start getting.... Paranormal (queue the X-files music). At this point the movie is losing it's identity and as a result I'm pulling back but I'd sunk an hour and a half in so far and enjoyed what I'd seen so I stuck through it and got the worst movie ending I'd seen this year. Right there next to Don't Breath, but unlike the ridiculous, cheesy ending of Don't Breath, this one didn't have any payoff, was rushed, and just generally silly. Some people said they laughed. I didn't find it funny personally, just a hugely insulting letdown to an otherwise goofy, but good movie. I guess the little girl was a demon from hell who needed to die so she could take over her brothers body and click another day while witches chant and beg for stuff. Verdict: Good movie overall but it seemed to lose it's identity partway through and devolved into absurdity, ultimately leading to a poor, rushed ending.",437,13,6,True

First, I'll review the film like I would any other and then I'm going to try and reason why audiences are reacting negatively to the film. I'm not sure if Hereditary is the greatest horror film ever but I certainly felt like I was watching my generation's Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby. The movie borrows heavily from those two films right down to the final scene. Despite this, it feels new and dangerous. I had no idea how the movie was going to play out which is a criticism I have with a lot modern horror/thriller movies. This in large part has to do with the marketing campaign but more on that later. I feel the term slow burn has a negative connotation associated with it and prefer to call this movie tense. It doesn't really on jump scares that plague a lot of modern horror and chooses tension and imagery to scare the audience with slow camera panning and fantastic cinematography, a nervous score, and great performances. Toni Collette gives and incredible performance as a manic mother who is mourning the loss of a parent. The supporting cast is fantastic as well and they all have a time to shine at some point in the movie. The movie is also challenging in its themes with relationships between parents and their children always in the forefront. The human drama of this movie far exceeded my expectations and is worthy viewing in its own right. To try and explain why audiences are trashing the film through some mediums (not as much on IMDb, see CinemaScore, Rotten Tomatoes for example) I think it is important to understand that we live in an impatient culture. Many horror classics of the past like the two I mention earlier weren't fast paced and instead lingered on images and favored slow paced horror. I think the modern horror audience can get restless when presented with a movie like this. I don't think Rosemary's Baby or the Exorcist would review very well with broad audiences if they were released today. Secondly, I think the film has succeeded in making people uncomfortable by questioning parent's feelings for their children and how they are displayed. This movie is complex and has a lot to say. Comparing this film to another fantastic horror movie from this year, A Quiet Place, offers a great juxtaposition of this idea. One is very simple in it's premise that quickly gets to the scares while the other takes it's time to build to a climax that may or may not be worth the wait depending on the viewer. Overall, Hereditary offers plenty of horrific imagery and supernatural scares that work as a deeper examination of familial relationships rather than being a string a horror movie cliches. 9/10 - excellent",497,374,270,False

I noticed, watching the movie a second time, that especially the soundtrack and several, selectively used sounds manage to terrify the viewer just by themselves. In combination with the simple but effective scenery the movie creates a haunting and paranoid atmosphere. Several, selectively used sounds (clicking with the tongue) left me paranoid for a long time. The movie takes some time for the exposition. The characters are well acted and therefore are the relationships and the individual character developments concrete to the viewer. The movie is mainly focused on a small family, which gives enough space to get to know the characters. Even though the horror is built up by a supernatural force, the real fear lays in the human reaction to that. The horror of 'Hereditary' is created by the human abysses created out of fear and incomprehension towards the unknown. Moreover, the movie takes place in locations, we already now from other horror movie. A huge, but lonely house in the nowhere that has some secrets about it. But this location is outstanding in comparison to other horror movies like 'It', because of the new and simple style of directing the movie. Allover, the realism of the movie and the simplicity make it so unique. Despite the outstanding performance of the movie, I have to critique the pacing towards the end, which seemed to be very hurried and ends the plot quite unsatisfactory.

imdb_hereditary_bertaut_20180622,Hereditary,IMDb,Bertaut,2018-06-22,7,Rewards concentration,"When her secretive mother dies, miniatures artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette), is almost relieved, as the two had a deeply fraught relationship. With two children, 16-year-old Peter (Alex Wolff) and 13-year-old Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and a loving husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), Annie is determined to do a better job of raising a family than she felt her mother did. However, when she suffers another, far more devastating loss, Annie's mental state becomes increasingly precarious, as a series of terrifying revelations about her ancestry are slowly revealed. Hereditary is writer/director Ari Aster's debut feature. However, what's worth noting is that the film is produced by Lars Knudsen, who also produced The Witch (2015). This is significant insofar as Hereditary bears more than a passing resemblance to Robert Eggers's film. Mood, tone, theme, pacing, narrative structure, shot composition; all recall The VVitch at times. Even the plot shares some important beats, most evident in the last shot, which is both narratively and compositionally identical to the shot in The VVitch when Black Phillip speaks for the first time - a BCU on a possessed character as a disciple speaks off camera. And like The VVitch, you either go with the plot and let it burrow under your skin, or you remain detached and most likely find the whole enterprise unintentionally hilarious. In a more generalised sense, there is quite a bit to praise here. For a start, to say the film is a horror is to basically give away the last 20 minutes, as up until that point it's a superbly realised semi-realist study of the crippling psychological disintegration that can accompany bereavement. Speaking of giving things away, very unusually for a Hollywood film, Hereditary's trailer brilliantly misdirects the audience, making it seem as if the film revolves around the death of Annie's mother, when in actual fact, this plot strand is abandoned at the end of the first act, after which the death of Charlie becomes the central focus. One thing the film does especially well is reward viewers who are paying attention. There are multiple hints and signs throughout of what is going to happen in the last act, and one especially well structured reward involves by far the creepiest moment in the film; the blond man standing in the shadows of the doorway, barely visible, smiling manically at Peter. This is actually the second time we see the character; he is also at the wake early in the movie, watching Charlie approaching the coffin, and, again, smiling unnaturally. This can be easily missed if you're not paying attention, and it's an extremely well realised pseudo-Easter egg. Also worthy of praise is Toni Collette, who gives a superb performance that partly recalls Shelley Duvall's hysterics in The Shining (1980). Collette's ability to communicate everything in her psyche by simply changing her facial expression is outstanding, and somewhat reminiscent of that extraordinary piece of wordless acting by Halle Berry in the last scene of Monster's Ball (2001). This is especially noticeably especially towards the end of the film, when Annie is alternating between being herself and being controlled by King Paimon; Collette's mastery of her own facial expression tells the audience everything it needs to know about what is happening. Joshua Rothkophf, in his review of the film for Time Out New York calls it ""a new generation's Exorcist."" That's a bit over the top; it won't have half the same kind of societal impact as William Friedkin's film did, and it's nowhere near as good as the best horror film of the last few decades, The Blair Witch Project (1999). However, it's very well made, is creepy as hell, dares to put real grief on screen, and features excellent performances (and, thankfully, only a couple of jump scares).

Throughout the narrative, the plot continuously builds on layers of mystery. As a viewer, I naturally expected some form of resolution or demystification by the end. However, the film ultimately delivers a barrage of unexplained elements and illogical developments. Why did the father-whose sole narrative purpose seems to have been to burn alive-suddenly combust when the book was thrown into the fire? Why was the mother flying in the final scenes? The recurring symbol, prominently placed throughout the film, was never explained. Joan's sudden shouting at Peter felt disconnected and lacked sufficient context. The list of bizarre and incoherent moments goes on. And then there's the ending-the scene in the treehouse. Frankly, it was a tonal collapse.

I had seen the trailer and all of the good press for it, I adore Toni Collete, and I generally enjoy horror films. I left the theater with a pit in my stomach and came back the next day to see it again; this is a film that rewards multiple viewings. The film began rather predictably, in my opinion. However, the truly unexpected and disorienting end of the first act grabbed my attention and never let up from there. This film digs its hooks in deep and slowly drags you down into a pit of despair. There is a gleam of light at the end of the tunnel, but it isn't what you think. This is the first film in a while to keep me on my toes throughout its runtime, even if its plot isn't groundbreaking. The amazing performances, sublime cinematography, and outrageously outstanding sound design makes this film a real treat for anyone with a special affection for the medium. I've seen many compare this to The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, and I agree mostly with those comparisons. However, I also see this film as a distant relation to the original 1976 Carrie. Both films put family drama at the forefront and milk every ounce of dread from the truly hideous realities of familial cohabitation for what it's worth. What makes these films so stirring isn't jump scares, special FX, or ""payoffs"" to every tense scene they present; it is instead forefronting the all-to-real human tension and making the audience sit with it as uncomfortably as possible. The scenes that stick with me from Carrie aren't just her supernatural revenge at the prom, but the abuse from her mother and the gut-punching shower scene that opens the film. It's those moments of having to experience the very real ugliness of humanity that stir me and stay on my skin for days after seeing a film. My opinion is that this film is a masterpiece and will certainly be joining my list of all-time favorite horror films. However, it is definitely not for everyone. This is a film that's made to stand out to already-avid film fans with an appreciation for the format; those with short-attention spans and/or those accustomed to the mile-a-minute breakneck pace of most horror films won't enjoy this. I also think (and I'm going out on a limb here) that this is a film most readily accessible to those who have already experienced a major physical or existential loss or crisis in their life or are intimate with the feeling of being manipulated. There a lot of reports of people ""giggling"" during the film; I think some of this can be chalked up to the sheer discomfort this film causes, but I also think it may in some cases come from not being able to grasp the logic and affective phenomenon of grief that this film so accurately and exquisitely captures. This film is a meditation on themes of grief, family, manipulation, and ultimately a lack of control. This isn't a film like The Conjuring (which is also one of my favorites) that gives you more than enough ""cues"" to be scared during certain parts of the film; instead, this film relies on your attention to detail and your willingness to be devoured by its sinister textures.",565,268,233,False
imdb_hereditary_jennifer626_20190620,Hereditary,IMDb,jennifer626,2019-06-20,6,Overrated but worth a watch,"Before watching Hereditary, I read a number of reviews that called it not only the best horror movie in 2018, but a competitor to The Exorcist. This set my expectations far too high, and it took me a while to get past being miffed and acknowledge the film's good qualities. Prepare yourself for an occasionally engaging but uneven film with a few novel twists, and hopefully you won't experience the same level of disappointment. The film is premised on the audience not truly understanding the nature of the characters. However, neither the characters as presented nor their interactions with each other ring true. Mother Annie (Toni Collette) is an artist who builds miniature worlds, often replicating personal environments such as her mother's sickbed. We're expected to believe that her work is in demand and that she is behind in creating new pieces for a gallery showing, but her art exists only as a conceit, a literal demonstration to the audience of her mental state. Her mismatched husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) is the world's worst psychiatrist, alternately enabling and ignoring the disturbing behavior of his wife and children. Their teenage son Peter is a stoner with a crush on the girl who sits in front of him. He is the most authentic of the family members, but the decisions forced upon him by the script - most of them related to Peter's sister Charlie - highlight that he exists only on film. Charlie is the most contrived of the lot, and it's not because of the reasons provided by the movie. Her matted, unwashed bob and cheap, oversized clothing are too shabby for a homeless girl, let alone one from an upper middle class home. It's impossible to believe that she is 13, let alone a girl who would attend (and whose mother would insist she attend) a high school party with drugs and booze. None of the revelations about Charlie fit with the developmentally delayed misfit portrayed. It's difficult to divulge more about the film's shortcomings without including spoilers. The positives are that the pace is relatively quick; there are some enjoyable jump scares; and regardless of its logic, the ending is unpredictable.

It was a long slow journey towards a disappointing end. Tension starts to build at certain points, but lets up too quick and we loose a bit interest in the characters as the movie progresses. The actors do a good job, but sometimes direction have them overact and that looses some of the impact. Some scenes are horrific, others almost comical. Can't recommend Hereditary to horror fans, but if you want a ""different"" sort of family drama with a satanic theme, give it a try and see what you think.",135,6,2,False

Somehow she is the mother of this demon cult - but she is dead. So you wonder why this did not happen before she died. A granddaughter who was supposed to be the demon lord. But she has nut allergies - I guess demon hunters should use nuts. She somehow gets killed in an accident and now her spirit wants the body of her brother. A mother who has sired the demon lord (as the daughter) - but unwillingly. In this movie the grandmother had (you see in photos and models) breast fed the child - so I guess queen demon follower breast milk produces demons - another stupid idea.

This is one of the best horror movies so far this decade, it doesn't rely on jumpscares or loud noises like most horror films its more of an unconventional masterpiece. I loved the tension created in this movie and the editing choices were phenomenal and actually unsettled me alot. The acting in this movie is superb especially by the females in particular Toni Collette who actually in my opinion gives the best female performance of the year. The film does not feel claustrophobic but it does feel contained in these particular locations which adds to the horror of this movie. This is Ari Aster's first feature lenght movie as a director and now he's on my radar I can't wait to see what he does next because he has crafted this movie to almost perfection. The ending has to be the best but also the most unnerving endings I've seen. The only flaw I can think of is the exposition which I get it that in such movies characters have to speak out the exposition but I felt this movie would've been better with less vocal exposition like The Shining. In the end, Hereditary is a very gripping, unnerving and unconventional horror film the best infact since The Babadook, it combines the elements of art house and horror very well and its a must watch for all horror fans but viewer discretion is advised because of it's disturbing nature.

The pacing, the editing, the cinematography, and the sound design all worked together to create a truly unique and hellish vision of horror. I'm a horror veteran, and rarely actually jump or feel tense, but this film made me feel like a horror virgin again, actually frightening me like no other Hollywood film can. The acting was also superb all around and only adds to the horror being presented on screen. Each character was unique and added their own style to this modern horror masterpiece. I saw many people in the theater jumping and looking away, some being grown men. A couple people even left, and I can't imagine its because they felt it was a bad film, because it was not. I am seriously considering going and seeing it again which hasn't happened since the Evil Dead remake and The Raid.

As the movie opens, we get to know Annie and Steve, and their teenage kids Peter and Charlie, as they attend the funeral of Annie's mom Ellen. Annie is surprised at the many people attending the funeral that shoe doesn't know. It's clear that Annie and her mom didn't have the best relationship, and Annie doesn't feel too sad about her mom passing. Meanwhile Peter is wanting to attend a party at a friend's house. Annie agrees but forces him to take along his younger sister, with disastrous consequences... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this is the debut feature-length film of writer-director Ari Aster. He brings us a tale of spiritualism gone horribly awry, and that;s about all I can say without spoiling anything. Let me be upfront: if it weren't for the off-the-charts ratings (currently at 93% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), I would not have gone to see this. But curiosity got the better of me when I saw this near-universal critical acclaim. What I got was a horror movie that is certainly not bad, but neither is it the masterpiece that the critic makes this out to be, and in fact ""Hereditary"" is not nearly as good as some other recent, far more clever and original, horror movies such as ""Get Out"", ""A Quiet Place, ""or ""It Comes At Night"", just to name those. Kudos to Toni Colette, who is outstanding as Annie, making this movie feel more authentic that it actually is. Last but certainly not least, there is a terrific, one might say classic, score, and imagine my surprise when I saw in the end titles that the score is composed by Colin Stetson, wow! I will need to check out the score for sure. ""Hereditary"" opened wide this weekend, and the Sunday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. In fact, the early box office reports are that the movie did better than expected/projected, grossing $13 mill (against a budget for a mere $10 mill). Bottom line: if you like horror movies, or are simply in the mood for one, I'd say keep your expectations in check as you see this out at the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",412,11,7,False

I am not too hard to please when it comes to horror movies, I enjoy bad horror movies equally as great ones, and when I finally got a chance to see Hereditary I went to see it with an open mind. Movie started well with some really nice scene transition so I had my hopes up. ""These people know what they are doing"" I thought to myself. Turns out, while production looked really nice, with few well directed scenes, screenplay and pace were horrible. We are treated with family drama for about 3/4 of the movie with last half an hour being mash of horror scenes. This could work if pace was better and we didn't have to watch long monologues by a lead actress. She did her part well and she literally carries the entire movie, but after second 10 minutes long monologue where I see nothing but her face, my tolerance for her and her character has dropped significantly. Once the horror actually starts, it does get from bad to worse, but as someone who has watched dozens of horror movies I could easily spot ""homages"" (or if you want to call them ripoffs) of scenes from plenty of other horror movies, mainly Conjuring, Exorcist 3 and The Sentinel. Ending is really messy and looks like it was made on spot. It wants to be intelligent, but once you break down the scene you'll realize that someone watched The Conjuring on Monday, Exorcist 3 on Thursday, and watched The Sentinel on Wednesday. Another problem is pace. Some scenes just drag on and on without real reason. I understand that director wanted to establish some atmosphere, however he isn't good at staging suspense so lot of scenes just drag on. Add in that some of those scenes don't really have strong payoff and you get long badly paced scenes with no real plot progression. Some characters just show up and wonder off the movie. I nearly forgot that one such character is even in the movie until he showed up to be cannon fodder. It was supposed to be emotional and horrifying but since we know so little about him it becomes a bad joke. I really don't know how anyone could by into hype. Did bunch of people just said ""It's great!"" without even seeing it, or bars for horror are so low these days that we consider cinematic mess like Hereditary and Insidious to be called ""greatest of XYZ""?",441,155,134,False
imdb_hereditary_emjgiddy_20231016,Hereditary,IMDb,emjgiddy,2023-10-16,7,Excellent Movie,"""Hereditary"" (2018), directed by Ari Aster, is an unrelenting and artfully crafted horror masterpiece that earns a well-deserved 9-star rating. This film transcends the traditional horror genre, delving into psychological terror and familial dysfunction to create an experience that's both deeply disturbing and thought-provoking. The film revolves around the Graham family, who grapple with a series of harrowing events following the death of the family matriarch. As her daughter Annie (Toni Collette) delves deeper into her family's dark and mysterious history, disturbing secrets and malevolent forces are unearthed, setting in motion a nightmarish descent into madness. What sets ""Hereditary"" apart is its willingness to push the boundaries of horror and delve into the psychological aspects of fear. Ari Aster's direction is masterful, utilizing slow-burning tension, nightmarish visuals, and a haunting score to create an atmosphere that's suffocating and relentless. The film's gradual unraveling of the family's secrets keeps the audience in a state of perpetual dread. The performances in ""Hereditary"" are nothing short of exceptional. Toni Collette delivers a tour-de-force performance as Annie, conveying a wide range of emotions from grief to terror. Her portrayal is both haunting and sympathetic, making her character's descent into madness all the more powerful. The film explores complex themes of heredity, trauma, and the destructive nature of family bonds. It challenges the viewer's perceptions of what is real and what is supernatural, blurring the lines between the psychological and the supernatural. The family's unraveling becomes a metaphor for the disintegration of sanity and the cyclical nature of trauma. ""Hereditary"" is not a film that relies on cheap jump scares; instead, it offers a slow and methodical buildup that leads to an overwhelming and unforgettable climax. It's a testament to the power of psychological horror to burrow deep into the psyche and haunt the viewer long after the credits roll. In conclusion, ""Hereditary"" is a modern horror classic that transcends the genre by offering a deeply disturbing and thought-provoking experience. Its artful execution, exceptional performances, and willingness to explore the darkest corners of the human psyche make it a standout in the horror landscape. With its enduring impact and ability to terrify and challenge, it confidently earns a 9-star rating.",365,4,1,True

However, it is in your best interests to check those expectations at the door prior to viewing the film. Multiple outlets went as far as to tout this Ari Aster creation as the next 'Exorcist.' Not only is that level of expectation unfair to the product, but they were released in different eras of storytelling, and the plots are very different. There will never be another horror film created that will shock audiences as 'The Exorcist' did in 1973. It changed the face of horror, all of film, forever. To be fair, had this film been released in the 70's, we would see overwhelmed, frightened fans being rushed to emergency rooms in the same way as following the release of 'The Exorcist.' Yes, both films release demons from hell through possession, but they do so in entirely different ways. Which brings us to reason No. 2 to disregard pre-release comparisons: the level of 'scary' reported and, as a result, expected will take away from your experience. Is 'Hereditary' the scariest movie ever? Absolutely not. It's likely not even the scariest film of 2018. However, that should not give the impression that the film is not disturbingly scary. Aster mostly forgoes the cliche jump scares in favor of dementedly-unnerving events that will haunt your thoughts. Some moments so cleverly filmed that you may not even realize the level of frightening until sometime after viewing the film. If viewed without expectations, you will leave the theatre satisfied, with the knowledge that this can be considered as another fine example of the recent high-quality, uniquely-imagined independent horror story releases. The acting is top-notch, the production is near flawless, and, short of a few complaints with the presentation of the ending, the direction should excite everyone looking ahead to future genre films from Aster.

Toni Collette gives by far the best performance I have seen by an actress this year and I can easily say that she deserves to be acknowledged in the upcoming Oscars. Even Alex Wolff, whom I did not think would do a great job within the movie, did an outstanding job. The thing that drives this movie forward is the pure tension that is felt not only within the characters and between them, but with the audience as well. This movie is horror at its finest, pure tension, no reliance on jumpscares. There was a particular scene that just blew me away with how well it was shot, it involved a character being in their bed and then looking around their room thinking to have heard something, and all the while, there is a mysterious figure lurking in the darkness. And rather than use this figure to provide a chance for a cheap jumpscare, the director just lets the audience soak in the image of that entity in the room with the character, and no jumpscare happens. This is the definition of a pure horror movie that relies on tension and nothing else. This is definitely one of the best movies I have seen all year, and the second best horror movie I have ever seen, right behind 2015's The Witch.

I was hooked from the first time I saw the trailer. The marketing and editing of the trailer was brilliant. It made me feel as though this was the next big thing in Horror movies. I felt hyped to see this movie! I even made jokes to my fiancee that I was going to be holding onto her, all during the movie and not to tell anyone if I ended up screaming or crying too loudly. I did not scream. I did not cry. I mostly laughed. Oh Zod, how I laughed out loud at this movie! That's when it clicked in my head that I had been suckered in by Hereditary... The problem with this movie, in my opinion, isn't that it's a bit slow in pace or tone; nor is it that the movie bait and switches the hell out of you---NO! The problem is that Hereditary believes its own hype; explains nothing and pats itself on the back for getting, to what equates to, a Participation Trophy! Listen, this movie isn't entirely bad or unwatchable---it has some great acting, scenes and ambiance---but it doesn't know what it wants to be. Honestly, it works better as a Drama, Suspense or Thriller but not as a half baked Horror film. Here are my thoughts on Hereditary; both good and bad: The Good: The acting in this film is very good (except for the dude who played the son) and believable. The mother gives very real reactions (mostly---she can over do it a bit) and you can feel her emotional exhaustion. The little girl who plays Charlie is very good in her role and I hope she continues to do other movies. She wasn't in the film for very long, but she did her best with what she had to work with. Most of the shots were used very well and added to the suspense. I even believe the director used a similar shot from The Shining in one scene. When Charlie dies, I felt horrible for the child. That was my emotional attachment to the movie. I was invested in the character and I was surprised when she was killed off, so early in the film. Regretfully, this is the end of the positive praises I have for Hereditary. The Bad: Oh Zod, where do I begin? I'll start with the obvious: THIS FILM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GENETICS! Watching the trailer, you might believe that the film is about a little girl, possible mentally ill or with supernatural powers, due to her genetics (why else call the damn thing Hereditary?!), that is getting out of control or is in some kind of peril. Or something along those lines. What you REALLY get is a film that has ZERO to do with this child (who the film maker makes the focus of the trailer!), ZERO to do with genetics and all things hereditary and an ending so stupid, it gives Mother! a run for its money! The movie does address (very poorly and vaguely) that some mental illness does run in the family and that the mother has even (unintentionally) tried to kill her children but at the end of the day, it isn't needed or important because the Big Bad here is Zhuul or Satan or some Devil King (who, I swear to Zod, wears a cheap looking Jugghead Crown)! I mean, imagine that for two hours, there's this guy who keeps talking about how he hates rice. This rice has done something to this poor guy, no doubt. Rice has to play into this story somehow! Then all of a sudden, the devil comes and kills him, puts on a stupid crown and leaves. The end. WHAT ABOUT THE DAMN RICE?! That's what this movie was. A bunch of talk and no good explanations. Speaking of which: Why? WHY?! That's all I could say after viewing this. Why did they make Little Charlie appear to be troubled, just to kill her off with no pay off? Why does the mom or any of the others in the family not know that Grandma is in a cult? Grandma was said to be this private woman but she literally leaves the mom nothing but Occult items! Why does the son cry like a cartoon baby? Why does the mom let a small teen go to a party with much older teens? Why does Charlie hide candy? Why does the dad go from being comforting to not having it overnight? Why was Charlie the grandma's favorite (assuming that she believed this was the Devil King) and not the actual MALE child? It's like she bent over backwards for this Devil King dude! In the end, there's just more questions; questions that lead to more questions and questions I never thought I'd ask. The bottom line to me is that people are going to walk out of the film thinking that the mentally ill are evil and are satanists and all that type of Stigma. I know it's true because I heard it myself! They used mental illness as the scapegoat for a cult movie. That's all Hereditary is: A movie about a grandma, who was a devil worshiper, who believed her deity was her granddaughter but wanted to be a boy, so somehow she kills her favorite grandchild so that her deity could then go inside her 2nd favorite one. Or something like that. It's STUPID! 6 out of 10 for effort...",924,14,15,True

imdb_hereditary_zevt_20191105,Hereditary,IMDb,zevt,2019-11-05,7,Almost a masterpiece - frustrating writing/ending,"This is an impressive horror movie with a lot going for it, but it is plagued by modern-day lazy writing which will frustrate a thinking audience. Lovers of this movie obviously haven't thought everything through as I will demonstrate below. And the slow-pace seemingly turned off a whole bunch of others, even though the superb gradually-building horror is one of its great strengths. The other impressive aspect is the acting, and this is universally acclaimed. It's about a family plagued by disturbing horror that has made them thoroughly dysfunctional. One death after another, each surrounded by mysterious and strange details, and their lives are constantly made worse by spooky hauntings and strange behavior and events. Suspicions of insanity are conflated with supernatural horror. The movie uses a heavy horror soundtrack and knows how to get under your skin using a mixture of classic horror and disturbing family drama and behavior. It does not resort to cheap jump-scares. (In fact, the movie could have been good even without the supernatural stuff by simply exploring insanity from trauma). *major spoilers follow* The one movie that this can be strongly compared to in terms of ideas and plot is Rosemary's Baby. The stuff that is clearly thought-out: Grandmother was obviously the leader of this cult that was trying to invoke Paimon in the bodies of her grandchildren. Presumably she wanted it done to her offspring for some reason, and they had to be young and 'vulnerable'. The previous attempt failed (Charlie) since she was female and they didn't know that this was important, and they had to kill her by invoking magic to undo it. There was also another failed attempt mentioned in the support meeting performed on Annie's brother. The rest of their efforts concentrated on Peter, whom they had to kill so that Paimon could take over his body. They even used and controlled her daughter (Annie) through 'sleepwalking' and possession to get their way, which is why she did all those strange and disturbing things to Peter. Joan, a cult member, was pure manipulation to get their way through psychological trickery (rather than possession which wasn't working so far). The seance was a distraction just to get her to read the incantation and involve her family and to bring Paimon's spirit into the house by calling Charlie's spirit (which previously hosted Paimon). This worked and escalated the horrors since Paimon was now hanging around the family as a malicious spirit, and it even tried killing Peter in school on its own. So their goal was to kill Peter for Paimon who was only now ready to take him. And now the stuff that wasn't thought through: If all they needed was Peter to die, then why didn't any of the cult members simply kill him in his sleep or some other way after Annie read the incantation? They had free access to the house obviously as is made clear many times. And it didn't require magic since obviously suicide was enough. And it didn't require him being scared and vulnerable since he obviously was petrified many times beforehand. If Annie had successfully burned Peter while 'sleepwalking' in the past, wouldn't this have deprived them of his body for Paimon? Plus, they hadn't yet released Paimon from Charlie at that time. So none of this sleepwalking stuff makes sense. Unless it was only her insanity added for random shock value. What was the big deal with the book that she tried to burn? It's just stupid pictures. Why did she believe it would help in any way? And why did the father burn down instead of her even though she threw it in the flames? Why did anyone burn at all? Either the book is meaningless in which case her motivation has no logic, or it is meaningful and yet it had no effect except to burn random people. 'Random malicious games by an evil spirit' doesn't explain why she was obsessed with the book to begin with while she was awake. What was the point of having Annie decapitate herself at that point towards the end? She was a useful tool until then and still hadn't achieved her purpose. So one can't even attribute this to 'random evil' from a being that likes decapitating people, since it's against their own interests. I mean they obviously were desperately trying to have her kill Peter until now and he still wasn't dead. In fact, what killed him was his own suicide from the surprise-shock of the three naked cult members after that. Which, once again, seems completely random and this from a cult that otherwise made careful plans. Inconsistencies galore! What's the point of the headless corpses? They were obviously dead since besides being headless, they were also decomposing and not moving. So why would the cult bother bringing them into the house and have them bow down in the final scene? Just more pointless shock tactics for the audience rather than the plot. In summary: The atmosphere and acting get 9 or even 10. The writing gets 8 or 1 depending on specific aspects of the plot. The problem is that the movie is effectively disturbing and seems like a great horror movie for most of its running time, except that the ending leaves you with unanswerable questions that don't allow the movie to make any sense. It's not just full of random malicious acts, it's also inconsistent with clearly stated motivations. So the frustration trumps the movie.

The film's unique ability to shake one's emotional equilibrium speaks to its remarkable storytelling and skillful execution, even though deciding whether you truly enjoyed it can be challenging in light of its unsettling nature. ""Hereditary"" is a tour de force that ventures into the darker realms of grief and supernatural horror. The story revolves around a family grappling with tragedy, and as they traverse their emotional landscape, the lines between the real and the supernatural begin to blur. Aster's mastery lies in his skillful manipulation of atmosphere, tension, and imagery, effectively planting the seeds of fear in the audience's psyche. The film's deliberate pacing and meticulous attention to detail immerse viewers in the eerie ambiance, setting the stage for escalating dread. The cinematography and direction capitalize on the uncanny, creating visuals that linger long after the credits roll. The slow burn nature of the narrative can be both a strength and a challenge, as it demands patience while ratcheting up the intensity. Toni Collette's performance as the mother struggling with her emotions adds a layer of authenticity to the proceedings. Her portrayal of grief, denial, and the slow descent into paranoia is both haunting and captivating. The emotional weight she brings to her character serves as a conduit for the audience's own emotional roller coaster. What sets ""Hereditary"" apart is its willingness to delve into themes that transcend mere jump scares. The film examines generational trauma, the fragility of familial bonds, and the desperation that accompanies loss. The supernatural elements act as metaphors for the uncontrollable forces that can consume individuals in times of intense pain. In retrospect, it's understandable that ""Hereditary"" leaves you in a state of emotional turmoil. The film's visceral impact testifies to its success in generating genuine fear and discomfort, but it also prompts reflection on the blurred line between horror and psychological drama. The unease you feel is a testament to the film's power to resonate deeply with its audience. ""Hereditary"" is a haunting exploration of the human psyche, a disquieting reminder that grief and horror can intertwine in terrifying ways. While it might be difficult to definitively say whether you enjoyed the experience, its ability to leave a lasting impression and spark discussions about the intersection of horror and emotional turmoil is undeniable.",402,5,0,False

I'll just go ahead and say this - Hereditary is absolutely brilliant. Just brilliant. It is a terrifying film written and directed by first-time director Ari Aster and stars Toni Collette in her finest role yet about the disintegration of a family. To say more about the plot would be too cruel - but, allow me to reiterate, Hereditary is TERRIFYING and one of the best horror films I've ever seen in my life. What I love so much about this film is it takes its time to introduce us to the characters - we get a sense of who the characters are within the first 20 minutes. It sets up the characters and develops them in a way that we don't usually see in horror films. Usually, they cut straight to incessant, annoying jump scares and give no backstory or character development. Hereditary makes you FEEL for the characters, so when you see their lives go awry, you truly feel it - psychologically and emotionally, because you really do care about these characters. The film only has a handful of jumpscares and relies much more on psychological tricks to mess with your mind. The film is incredibly intense and uncomfortable to watch for the first 80 or so minutes, before transitioning into full-blown Lynchian horror in the last 40. It never pulls back - the horror is traumatic, cruel, and relentless. It does not allow you to breathe - once it pulls you in with its cinematic tricks, you're stuck. Pure arthouse magic. It also has a very human side to it. All supernatural occurrences aside, it is at its heart an exploration into grief, and how grief is almost like a ghost, haunting the entire family. It is also a film about how grief is dealt with, and what lengths people would go to stop grieving. The score, cinematography and lighting is just brilliant. Ari Aster has set himself up for a talent not to be ignored. The fact that this is his first feature film is INSANE. The film is so well directed, you never would have guessed this is Ari Aster's first film. Brilliant. I will say this though - Hereditary is not a 'fun' horror movie like most, - you can't go in and expect to be thrilled. No, instead, the film is dark, depressing, disturbing, hard to watch and incredibly unbearable with its intensity levels. I did, at some points, especially during the traumatizing finale, want to leave the cinema because it simply became too much to handle for me. Don't get me wrong this isn't a bad thing at all though. Overall, HEREDITARY is just terrifying. It grips you and doesn't let you go and just when you think it cannot get more shocking and disturbing, it does.

imdb_hereditary_rforfilm_20180610,Hereditary,IMDb,RforFilm,2018-06-10,9,NULL,"Hereditary truly is scary. It throws you into a nightmare and understands the simple fear of mental illness Having a mental illness is enough to be frightening. When you're in that state in which you have no idea whether your thoughts are your own or a manifestation of the illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar, or even depression. All these can cause sudden changes that are never that of the person's character, but of the cause of a chemical imbalance. Now how about we add a supernatural element into the mix, and you have another layer of mystery. You may notice that a lot of the best ghost stories include people that usually have a mental illness or a secret background. Either elements cleverly add to unbalance of the character, making their situation and our viewpoint as an audience more frightening. Movies like The Haunting, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and The Conjuring feature characters with the previously stated attributes that added to the film's suspenseful tone without going too over-the-top. One notion that's not addressed too often in movies about mental illness is the hereditary aspect. Those of us who've grown up with a family history of that can be scared themselves that destiny will force them with the same problems. Hereditary brilliantly adds many layers to that fear along with a ghost story. A miniature artist Annie Graham (played by Toni Collette) is in the middle of dealing with her mother Ellen's passing. At the funeral, she mentions that she had a shaky relationship with her, who in return, was a private woman. Her family includes husband Steve (played by Gabriel Byrne), teenage son Peter (played by Alex Wolff), and daughter Charlie (played by Milly Shaprio). In addition to her daughter being a reclusive oddball, she reveals at a support group that her family has had a history of mental illness. Annie also starts seeing her mother in random spots in the house (even though no one else can see her). Another family tragedy ends up pushing Annie's mental state further until she meets a woman Joan who tells her that the dead can be contacted through a séance. Annie then uses the tricks taught to her to show the family that it's real. Time passes by as more images of the family are heard and seen in ghostly form while the living members each go through their own trials that reveal more about Ellen. Like a lot of horror movies, what's best is what you don't know and Hereditary has those necessary layers. Let's address the most important aspect of it, the characters. Toni Collette proves again that she take the typical ""mom"" trope and give it that extra weight. It helps that along with her family history and the fact she does have a lot on her belt, she still has the motivation to dig deeper on what's going on. This makes the story just as interesting to us as it is to her. Peter Wolff, fresh from the recent Jumanji, looks a little old, but he also balances the stress of being a teenager and the dilemma that he's facing. Finally, I have to give a lot of points to Milly Shapiro for playing what has too be one of the more unsettling performances of the movie. Where Hereditary shines is in it's tone and atmosphere. Walking into this movie is like walking into a true nightmare. There aren't any big fantasy-like set pieces or even a gothic house, but it takes the kind of household you might see from an upper class family and make it feel so uncomfortable and unfamiliar that moving forward is like taking a deep breath. It all relies beautifully on the story, which I cannot spoil, but adjusts to the overall mood. Finally, what makes Hereditary such an unforgiving, not pleasant experience is how much it understands the human mind above ghosts. It understands that when we lose someone, we always want to see them one more time, but shudder at the idea of them coming back. It's that genuine feeling of feeling alone in a familiar environment that makes it scary. I'll admit that without spoiling anything, the movie's distinct 2 acts will feel jarring for a mainstream audience expecting one outcome. I really enjoyed this and I think a lot of horror fans will do so too, but I can see this being disliked by people who expect something more straightforward. I'll give this nine miniature rooms out of ten. I really liked Hereditary. We seem to be living in an era where the best original ideas come from the horror genre.

imdb_hereditary_bricemavillaz_20190612,Hereditary,IMDb,bricemavillaz,2019-06-12,6,A great quality watch but a bit overrated,"After hearing much ravings about this one, I gave it a go. Unfortunately and as always, it doesn't live up to its hype (so never believe it). Awesome actors (Byrne and Collett were oustanding as always), though Alex Wollf delivers a very flat and dull performance. It fits his character but it does a disservice to the actor. Hereditary's main stand out point is it doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares to work, it knows how to build tension and mood in a mature and smart way, using slow shots and a truly remarkable soundtrack. However, the movie could have been 10 to 20mns shorter, I think it would have helped the rhythm, which feels kinda slow and dragging in some points. I also thought the ending was kind of underwhelming, you see it coming from three miles away (though the movie delivers what's expected, it doesn't ""pretend"" it's going to surprise you with a twist ending). Clues are peppered throughout the movie starting at the very beginning, but in my opinion they're way too obvious and literal...kinda feels like the director thinks you're a very thick person that doesn't get subtle clues. The other thing I disliked about the ending is that it's too explicit...I wish the director would have gone for a less ""in your face"" approach for the finale, and maintained a kind of ""did this really happen?"" vibe. As it is, I feel the ending (the 5 final minutes) is redundant and hammers in what has been established throughout the movie. Great film, solid horror movie, definitely worth a watch, but in my opinion the director lacks maturity and has a tendency to hammer in what should have been better left implied and suggested. It would have been a really great film if the director, talented as he his, wouldn't have treated the audience like 12 year olds that need explicit scenes to understand the underlying message. Really good horror movie, but not nearly as awesome as everyone says it is. This speaks volumes how low the public's standards have fallen, thanks to useless and exploitative garbage like paranormal activity, people now seeing a decent horror movie call it a masterpiece. It's good, but nowhere near the gem it's heralded as. And the director, although lacking in maturity, is definitely someone to watch out for. A good 6.5/10.",391,4,2,True

No cheap scares here, thick tension building atmosphere and bread crumbs of clues lead up to one of the most intense final acts I have seen in awhile.

Also, you know, not so long ago I literally couldn't watch horror films, but I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job in overcoming this genre barrier XD The Shining, now this one. Maybe more to come. We'll see. Anyway, Hereditary is a horror film which tells the story of the Grahams, a family with a toxic habit to repress their problems instead of confronting them. After the death of the grandmother of the family (the mother of the family's mom) weird things start to happen to the family members, things that seem to push the already crumbling family over the edge. I don't have many issues with the film, I guess. There's a certain climactic moment with weird score in the background. Like, it doesn't fit it very well and it feels even ridicolous in a way. And, maybe sometimes there are bits of dialogue that feel somewhat artificial (either because of the writing, the delivery or both) but it's not common in the film to be a major issue. And I guess that it does work narrative-wise most of the time, so it's not a big deal. Moving on, I really like how the film handles the whole repression theme in multiple layers. It's simple once you get it, but it's still quite effective. I can't really dive into how the film does that without spoiling it, but I will say that it does so very well. It shows both in the traumas the family had in the past, the thing they're going through now and how they confront it all (they don't). This is the main thing (aside from the plot itself and the mystery etc) that makes this movie work the way it does. The last 20-25 minutes or so of the film are great, too. They're creepy, intense and thrilling. The cinematography of the film is alright+ most of the time, but as we're getting closer to the end the cinematography gets better and better. The camerawork really shines during that part of the film. The acting of the four main characters is very solid as well. All of the actors of the family member bring them to life in a way that fits the characters very well. Great casting, by the way. So, yeah. I don't think that any element of the film is phenomenal, but it accomplishes what it tries to in my opinion. Most aspects of the film are decent overall, and its portrayal of repression is genuinely creative. I'm feeling a 7.1/10 on this one.",436,4,2,False

To some, it might even feel slow or confusing. But for true film lovers or regular viewers who appreciate layered narratives and slow-burn tension, Hereditary is a hauntingly brilliant experience. Toni Collette delivers an absolutely mesmerizing performance. Her portrayal of a grieving mother unraveling under invisible forces is both raw and terrifying. Her performance alone keeps the film emotionally engaging from start to finish. The makeup, set design, and overall visual tone feel grounded and unsettling, helping build a world that feels scarily familiar. Ari Aster's direction is, as always, masterful.

Not this movie. Hereditary is one of the more interesting haunting movies I've seen in a while. The problem being this film falls into a lot of same tired tropes and cliches those do. ""The story focuses on the Graham, where the mom and wife Annie has just lost her mother"". Honestly, the first synopsis said this, but then it also said something along the lines of ""but a series of events will unravel their families deep past and her mothers crimes"": something like that. I'd wanna see that movie, maybe something like the Wrecked film with Adrian Brody, where his amnesia starts to disappear and his crimes are brought to light. Instead we have, mediums and some ghosts. And really, what did the name hereditary have to do with the film anyway; did it just sound cool? Some good things I liked included Toni Collette's performance, which isn't surprising, I've loved her since I saw The Sixth Sense the first time. I even enjoyed Millie Shapiro's performance as the daughter, for the screen time she was given. Other than that, none of the other actors stand out. The film stars Nat Wolff's brother Alex Wolff, and I thought he'd be great in this, but he just wasn't. I think he was miscast in this. None to mention his performance is either underperformed or overacted. Worst thing about his performance in this are all the scenes where he's meant to be crying, and he was straight up acting like he was mocking someone crying, not actually crying, made me laugh. As for all the other stuff I didn't like: the movie felt too long right off the bat. There are scenes that are meant build some kind of intensity and a spooky atmosphere, but it lingers on the shot too long and all the tension disappears. It got annoying at a point. And I won't spoil the ending, but it left me scratching my head down to the bone. I say this a lot, but it legitimately felt like the director thought of it on the spot. Unless there's a sequel coming to explain all this, I'm just completely lost. I recently saw Mother! with Jennifer Lawrence and I could instantly tell it was a metaphor or interpretation of biblical scripture; what was this movies message; if your daughters a weirdo, she'll bring about the anti-christ or something? The ending was getting flashes of Only God Forgives just watching it, it was that artsy-fartsy ""Oh....what does it mean?"" Not a film I'm gonna watch again anytime soon.

imdb_hereditary_littlemankazoo_20180612,Hereditary,IMDb,littlemankazoo,2018-06-12,8,An Unconventional Horror Thrill Ride,"In this age of horror being very much reliant on the gimmicks and unique right hooks to the audience to get them into the seats, it's not entirely common that one sees a good old fashioned spook-house horror film. No gimmicks. No twists. Just a film that does its absolute best to get your skin crawling, nerves tightened, and heart pounding. 'Hereditary', as you may imagine, is one of those films. 'Hereditary' is about as simple as a horror movie nowadays can come; terrible circumstances befall a seemingly ordinary family, these circumstances lead to discoveries of something terrible in their family tree, and soon enough things come apart rather quickly. What this film excels at is all in the technicals. The performances are all beyond convincing and do the job selling the understated terror this film has to offer. Specifically, Toni Collette delivers in a manner that had even my skin crawling. What is also noticeable when it comes to this film's strengths is the excellent cinematography. While it is perhaps not as flashy and noticeable as 'Upgrade' and its revolutionary camera-work that I raved about, this film accomplishes a more suitable sense of suspense and nerve-wracking tension through it. Whether in-motion or standing completely still, the camera makes itself apparent in this film and works beyond effectively. The only thing of it is, this film is not for you if you prefer a straightforward and conventional horror film. The first act is very much a slow burn, while the rest of the film builds its horror and tension in ways that I do not believe a general audience would appreciate quite as much. It's not abstract, but considering it lacks the conventions of jumpscares and instead relies on atmosphere, mood, and its performances to scare...that perhaps explains a bit why the film is striking the general audience as so polarizing. But, if you can appreciate a slow, creepy, atmospheric film that aims directly to make your skin crawl and make you shuffle in your seat, I think you'll truly enjoy the ride this film takes you on. Unconventional, scary as hell, but perhaps not perfect in what it aspires to do, 'Hereditary' is still a scary time for all the right reasons.",373,70,65,False

While it's clear that some effort was put into developing the story and characters early on, I thought the storyline was messy, over-the-top and even quite silly towards the end. By far the most impressive aspect of 'Hereditary' is the acting. Toni Collette has always impressed me in the roles I've seen her in previously and she is again excellent in the lead role in this film. Milly Shapiro also deserves a mention for an effectively creepy and disturbing performance as the daughter. They make the film watchable and probably a lot scarier than it would have otherwise been.

A cut above the norm for modern fright fare.,"The death of a family matriarch serves as the catalyst for strained occurrences within a highly dysfunctional family. Annie (an excellent Toni Collette) is a professional diorama creator and outsider in her own family. She's clearly a troubled individual, and becomes even more so when an unspeakable tragedy takes place. After a seance, she becomes determined to contact her loved one, and she eventually learns that there's some sort of sinister plot afoot involving her late mother. Right from the start, it's clear that this won't be to all tastes. Debuting writer / director Ari Aster goes for an uncommon thing in this day and age: the ""slow burn"". His pace is so measured that impatient viewers will likely tune out of this one early on. Some people may also find Collettes' histrionics a bit much, but there's no denying that she commits 100% to this character she's playing. ""Hereditary"", on the whole, has a *very* grim, oppressive atmosphere; after that devastating turn of events around the 34 minute mark, things just keep getting darker and darker. Aster gives his film some fairly potent visual gimmicks and imagery, and parcels out bits of gore here and there. But this film, which goes on quite long for this sort of thing (clocking in at two hours and eight minutes) adds some depth to what might have been a familiar set-up by making its first half a character study / heavy drama, detailing how people either cope or can't cope after a tragedy. Shapiro is well cast, and Wolff does a decent job although he really isn't the greatest at screaming or fake-crying. At first, the film seems like an egregious waste of able veteran Gabriel Byrne, but he gets more to do as the story plays out, portraying a husband / father who keeps getting faced with insanity within his family. Ann Dowd is good as a new friend who introduces Annie to the supernatural in order to kick off the films' second half. The resolution, however, may come as a disappointment to some people given how effective all the set-up is; this can unfortunately sometimes happen with films that take this approach. But this viewer wasn't really bothered by it. Seven out of 10.",374,5,5,True
imdb_hereditary_dingane_20180609,Hereditary,IMDb,dingane,2018-06-09,10,On my top 20 horror movies of all time list.,"This is not a monsters jumping out of darkness going ""boo"" type of horror movie. Don't come into this thinking it's a sensationalist monster-makeup horror movie or a jump-scare horror movie. It's so much more than that. Two things make this movie fantastic. First, it's a meditation on anguish so real and believable that it's really hard to take at times. Toni Collette delivers a scene of overwhelming pain and anguish that could win her an Oscar. So much pain that, to borrow from Col. Walter E. Kurtz, ""I wanted to rip my teeth out; I didn't know what I wanted to do."" It's just a damned good movie about loss and pain, to say nothing of it being a truly creepy horror story. Second, the pacing is phenomenal. It's a slow burn at first, in which the creep-factor slowly builds. By the time you reach the climax...I don't know, I'll just say that my jaw literally dropped open once the climax started. I'm a horror junkie. I love all kinds of horror movies from comedy-horror like Cabin in the Woods to paranoid horror like John Carpenter's The Thing to out-and-out silly horror like Dead Alive to drama horror like Rosemary's Baby. This is something more like Rosemary's Baby. Rosemary's Baby was fantastic not just because it was about a woman giving birth to the anti-Christ, but because it was a claustrophobic vision of the social powerlessness of being a woman in 1960s America. This is like that. It's going to be a horror classic for sure. I can't decide where it fits in my list of all-time favorite horror movies, but it's top 20 at least. It's also a movie you need to see twice. Honestly, though, I'm going to have to give it a minute before I see it again. It's pretty rough (in a good way).",309,36,29,False

imdb_hereditary_burlesonjesse5_20180613,Hereditary,IMDb,burlesonjesse5,2018-06-13,6,VIEWS ON FILM review of Hereditary,"""Don't you ever raise your voice to me, I'm your mother!"" So quips the character of Annie Graham in Hereditary. Graham is shown in a couple of close-up scenes shivering like Danny Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. It's a valiant effort but it pales in comparison to what Kubrick did with grainy early 80's, lens chic. Anyway, Hereditary contains decapitations and spiritual seances. It has buzzing flies and scaling demons. It boasts plenty of adolescent weed smoking and head-scratching dollhouse construction. Finally, Hereditary heralds a performance from Toni Collette that's better than her Oscar-nominated turn in The Sixth Sense. Taking place in mountainous Utah and directed by a first-timer (NYC's own Ari Aster), Hereditary's blueprint story involves a family dealing with the loss and grief of veritable loved ones. The movie then veers more into mumbo jumbo territory with a screw loose ending involving naked Paimon spirits. Hereditary, which has a trailer that's very misleading, isn't just about a dead grandmother and a creepy thirteen-year-old who makes noises with her jaw. No there's much more going on than that. Maybe too much and not of the overriding kind. In truth, I may have gotten a slight Amityville Horror/Shining vibe from watching Hereditary. Too bad I can't garner a recommendation. What can I say, it takes a heck of a lot more than contrived references and manner over substance to get me scared. For what it's worth, helmer Aster does an impressive job with a $10 million dollar budget. His camerawork is supreme, he bounces off of Hitchcock, and he sets up a lot of his shots well. His Kubrickian-like direction laced with art house novelty is assured but for all the wrong reasons. Hereditary goads you and baits you into thinking you'll be frightened out of your seat. The problem is that nothing ever quite comes to fruition making Hereditary the ultimate cinematic tease. In conclusion, many critics have already hailed Hereditary as a horror masterpiece. I for one think it's too slow burned, too faux inducing, too baffling, and a bit overrated. Hereditary may offer a few eldritch moments but it doesn't ""inherit"" greatness.

Yes, the ending could've been better, a lot better, but it was really psychologically thrilling and spooky, especially for a Netflix movie. I'm really impressed with Netflix's content lately. I see trends in the low star reviews that I want to address. 1) ""the ending was bad"" I agree, but the rest of it wasn't. A movie with a bad ending isn't going to be the best movie of all time, but if I enjoy watching 90% of the movie, then I would say I got my time's worth. It's just a shame that it didn't take the opportunity to use the ""monsters who scare your mind, not just rip up your body"" thing that it could have had going for it. 2) ""not scary enough"" it was suspenseful and creepy. It's more psychologically thrilling than outright terrifying, and I genuinely wonder which movies these people deem scary enough for them to enjoy because most horror movies really suck, especially in the past 20 years. Where are they finding all these ""genuinely scary"" movies? Or are they just consistently always disappointed with all of the horror movies they watch but keep watching them anyways? I have a lot of questions. 3) ""didn't capture the essence of the book"" why does everyone who reads a book that gets made into a movie feel the need to say this? I'm not sure if they just like being pretentious or if they genuinely believe a 90 minute movie must entirely capture the essence of a full length novel. There's no reason to judge them as if they need to be identical. They're standalone works. When I choose to watch the movie, I would hope that they don't drag it out as long as turning a book into a literal script would require. 4) ""Blair witch rip off"" very few movies, songs, books, etc. are truly original. You can make a movie with the same basic story tone as another one. Add your own twist, or don't, whatever, I'm not the purity police - just make an entertaining work without breaking copyright laws. If I'm entertained, I don't care if it resembles something else that also entertained me.

Yet so many horror films completely overlook this element in their film. 'The Ritual' does not make this mistake. These characters are highly flawed, but they're also relatable and we as an audience can understand (if not fully agree with) choices and decisions they've made. I suspect a lot of this stems from the fact that 'The Ritual' was based on a novel as the source material. Movies based on novels almost always contain more depth to their characters for obvious reasons. So you've got yourself a set of great characters, but that still isn't enough to guarantee a successful film. You now have the obligation to utilise those characters you've created. 'The Ritual' ticks that box as well. Firstly, it's a great looking film. They did a fantastic job picking the setting for the film. Creepy and atmospheric, whilst beautiful and endearing at the same time. Secondly, this film ticks possibly the rarest box a horror movie is ever able to achieve these days, which is to be scary. I almost never get any rise in my heart-rate during a horror film any more, but that was certainly not the case here. I was invested in the story and the suspense had me on edge. The first 3/4 of the film are some of the best mystery, suspense, horror film watching I've done in years. This film was almost destined for greatness, but unfortunately the final 1/4 does let things a slip a bit.

In The Blair Witch Project you will never get an answer nor see the thing that freightened everybody and that was a major letdown, plus it was not filmed good at all. Supposition of evil in horror movies is good, in the right ambiance, but at one point you have to see the evil force in real to be satisfied. In The Ritual you get that and that's a bonus. The acting was good, all characters added something to the story. A story that is creepy enough for a horror/thriller.

imdb_the_ritual_keruirenlei_20170918,The Ritual,IMDb,keruirenlei,2017-09-18,7,The Ritual (2017),"2017 has been a very mixed year for horror (so far, anyway) We've had some fairly terrible movies like Rings, The Bye Bye Man and Annabelle: Creation but we've also had some unique, memorable films such as Get Out, It Comes at Night and IT. I'm still holding out for films such as Happy Death Day, Jigsaw and Creep 2 to be great but one film I didn't expect to enjoy was The Ritual. I saw the trailer before my screening of IT and it looked to be just another throwaway horror movie trying to be the next The Blair Witch Project. Thankfully, the film's trailer was just a poor attempt at showing what the film actually is like and shouldn't be used to assess the quality of the movie. The film's premise isn't entirely original, a bunch of friends decide to go hiking and to save time decide to cut through an eerie forest. This premise has been done to death in movies and even though director David Bruckner (V/H/S/) tries to set his film apart from the rest, the final product ends up feeling very cliché. Where the film does shine is with its cast of characters, the four friends on their hiking adventure which takes a sour turn for the worst. Our protagonist Luke (Rafe Spall) is the most interesting, fleshed-out character of the bunch and I was surprised to find out that the first act of the movie is centred around character development which really gave us a chance to learn about and care for these characters. After witnessing the murder of his friend, Robert (Paul Reid), Luke suffers incredible guilt and feels as if he's responsible for Robert's death as he chose to hide instead of step in and try to protect his friend. Spall does a good job portraying Luke by going the quiet and reserved route for the first half of the movie and while I wouldn't say there were any stand-out performances, everybody involved did well with the material they had and the banter between the friends kept things interesting and was good fun to watch. One of the things I absolutely loved about this movie was how it looked visually. Director of photography Andrew Shulkind (Southbound) does an incredible job of making the audience feel like they're in the woods with these friends. The incredible overhead shots of the area truly makes the forest feel like its own character which I adored. However, some of the scenes shot at night are hard to make out due to how dark it is at times but during the daytime sequences, the film looks visually stunning. One of the weaker aspects of the movie is the horror. I'd actually hesitate to even call this movie a horror flick and feel like if it was marketed as a thriller, people would have enjoyed this movie a little more (judging from some of the mixed reception it's received after it's premiere at TIFF and ODEON's Scream Unseen program, which I saw the film at). Although there's a few unsettling images and scenes scoured throughout, I wouldn't say any of it was that scary. For the majority of the second act, the horror comes from the friends discovering horrific things such as a bear pinned up to a tree with its guts ripped out. Like I said before, not entirely original but still unsettling. When the friends realize they're going to have to find shelter on the first night of their venture into the woods, they stay the night in an abandoned cabin which has strange markings inside, similar to ones they've seen on some of the trees outside. After searching the house for items to start a fire, they discover a strange pagan headless creature in the basement which looks like something ripped directly out of The Wicker Man. After discovering this strange figure, the friends all try to get some sleep but are each haunted by nightmares. Although we get to hear about most of them, the only ones we get to experience are Luke's. All of them reside in the shop where Robert was murdered and each one of these gets progressively more and more disturbing throughout the course of the film. Without going into spoiler territory, the third act of the movie caught me off guard and really surprised me. As I said before, the trailer made it seem as if this film was just trying to be the next Blair Witch but once the true nature of the film is revealed, I was on the edge of my seat until the credits rolled. The film has a lot of charm and humour which also surprised me. There's a few moments in the movie during the third act which had myself and the audience in hysterics. Also, it might contain my favourite visual gag of the entire year involving Luke and an old lady. The film takes itself very seriously but knows when to have fun and lighten up the tone a little. This isn't a comedy though so if you're expecting something along the lines of Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead in terms of humour, you're going to be disappointed. The humour is definitely a welcome addition though. Overall, The Ritual was a very fun time. Although, I wouldn't say it's my favourite horror-thriller movie of the year, it does a great job making you feel lost in the woods with these characters and with a surprise shift in tone during the third act, the movie never feels boring or uninteresting. Good performances, stunning visuals and an entertaining, albeit cliché premise make for a solid directorial feature debut. I'm looking forward to see more from Bruckner in the future and if his previous work is any indication of how versatile he is as a horror filmmaker (he previously worked on the first short in the horror anthology V/H/S/) then we're in for a treat.",993,42,26,True

Rob wants to hike in Sweden, but the others all make fun of him. On their way home, Luke decides to get a bottle of vodka in a convenience store. Inside, Rob is killed by criminals when he won't give up his wedding ring. Luke is too slow to help and can only watch his friend be killed. From these very urban origins, the rural horror of The Ritual begins. To celebrate their friend, the survivors take the trip he wanted to Kungsleden, or King's Trail, in Sweden's Sarek National Park. One of them hurts his knee, so they decide to take a faster path home, but start to discover strange things like animals gutted and hung from trees and strange runes carved in the trees. Seeking shelter in an abandoned house, the men discover more runes and strange statues, yet they stay there for the night. When Luke wakes from an evening of nightmares, he has puncture wounds all over his chest. As they go deeper into the forest, their feelings toward one another - some blame Luke for Rob's death - come to light. And they start getting killed off by whatever is tracking them and left hung like the animals they say before. Soon, only Luke and Dom are left and the latter has been selected as a sacrifice to the Jötunn, who takes human lives and gives immortality in return. Luke must take part in the ritual and submit to the god or die. He refuses and the creature makes him relive his nightmares again and again until he's able to fight back and make his way to the edge of the woods, a place where it loses its power. Screaming in its face, Luke has survived. Directed by David Bruckner (V / H / S, Southbound), whose work I hadn't enjoyed much until this film, this is a great throwback to 1970's occult horror.

However, there are a number of unanswered questions along the way, ranging from why the central character keeps having visions of his friend's murder to how the killings in the forest had somehow eluded the local authorities for years. Had questions like these been eventually answered, we would have possible had a compelling, if still somewhat derivative, horror movie.

There's no escaping it – but fortunately if you love some horror then it's not a time that fills you with dread; you actually find yourself looking forward to it! Not that many of these horrors are actually good; many that come out these days are predictable, cheesy and more funny than scary. Yet every now and then a horror comes out that's different; one that shakes up the genre and defies the audience's expectations, breathing fresh life into the genre. Sadly, although it may have seemed that way in the trailer, The Ritual is not one of these films. Rather, it's one of those lacklustre horrors that will inevitably find themselves in the corner of forgettable horrors on Netflix. Much of it is very much reminiscent of horror classics The Blair Witch Project and The Wicker Man (the latter becoming much more obvious in the final act of the film). In fact this film really does feel like it's two distinct parts – the initial phase, taking up the first two thirds of the film with a strong Blair Witch feel to it, and the final phase, feeling very much like a Wicker Man tribute. If the final section was intended to refresh the film and turn it on its head in an ingenious way, this fails as the two sections seem so different and disjointed it doesn't flow well and seems like a strange jump; particularly since the end is barely explained, leaving us with much more questions than we should really have. Still, while the ending may be weak, the beginning by contrast is fairly strong, giving us an enjoyable, solid set up. The bleak murder of their friend is dark and impactful, with Rafe Spall's portrayal very good as you can see in his face how this event has affected and changed his character. Still it's not just Spall who carries this film; a large part of the strength of the beginning is due to the chemistry and banter between the four friends, the way they joke and interact with each other remaining enjoyable and, most importantly, believable throughout. This gives the film its own personality and, when they finally get into the forest and come across creepy goings-on (such as a dead deer and an unsettling wooden hut) this stands out as being particularly creepy, the contrast giving the horror more of an effect. It's in this hut where things start to change; not just for the characters but for the film itself. The first night is justifiably strong and creepy, seemingly setting up a fairly scary movie with strong elements of horror – sadly though it just doesn't seem to go this way. After this point The Ritual begins its slow descent, as the thread unravels and the plot crumbles, leading us to a pretty slow and dull middle, before the unsatisfying ending. Once the horror starts the banter stops and the group start turning on each other – something you'd think would be a strong point. But the arguments are quickly resolved and the characters don't continue to develop throughout this point, remaining half-developed. Then whenever any deaths happen, as an audience we aren't as fussed as we should be. If only the final third brought it all together, but instead it's a nonsensical finale, attempting some semblance of a reasonable plot, with just an easy line or two in an effort to explain things. Not that everything in a film needs spelling out, sometimes less is more; but when there's next to nothing, this makes what would be a strength into a weakness. At the end, we still don't know exactly who the creepy occult are, what the monster is or does, or even necessarily what it looks like – the latter being particularly disappointing since from it's silhouette it looks like it could have been an interesting monster design, but all we see is a shadow of an oversized moose. Whilst the sinister and creepy atmosphere is nicely kept up throughout, it's a shame there wasn't much horror or actual scares for us to enjoy. It's seldom scary and just occasionally unsettling at best. At least there are no cheap jump scares; instead there's just the occasional cut to a different scene with a loud-ish noise that might make some of the more nervous audience members jump slightly. Still I was a fan of how a lot of the horror is an allegory for Luke's guilt in not intervening in his friend's murder. Unfortunately this is referenced so often that the constant flashing back to the scene of the crime loses its potency and starts to become tedious. The Ritual isn't a bad film per se at all; rather it feels as though all the ingredients are there, but it's just a missed opportunity. The bunch of friends are all likable, well-cast and well-acted, their banter carrying the film in the first act nicely. The constant sinister atmosphere is good, but sadly the horror and scares are missing, with the end feeling like such an unsatisfying mess that it eclipses most of what was good in the beginning. So The Ritual won't be taking the spot for best horror this year – that spot may be reserved for It or Get Out, but let's wait to see what Jigsaw is like before we declare the winner",912,33,28,False
imdb_the_ritual_jtncsmistad_20180205,The Ritual,IMDb,jtncsmistad,2018-02-05,7,"""The Ritual"": Monster Movie as Allegory","The recently released ""The Ritual"" is a monster movie, with the creature springing forth from ancient Norse legend. But it is more than that. The level of performance by a quartet of actors is a prime cut above standard scary flick fare. And there is actually a point to the proceedings beyond doom, gloom and ripping apart human flesh-a message of redemption in struggling to overcome one's most incapacitating foibles (guilt, arrogance, fear and loneliness are all explored) that resonates straight through to the end of ""The Ritual"". At times subtle, at times stark, it manages to consistently creep through the chaos with both clarity and resonance. This is hardly a common component across the bulk of the genre. And it is in no small part a tribute to the vision and sensibility of Director David Bruckner. When I spoke with Bruckner recently he confirmed that, while horror is his thing, he believes that that which scares us on screen is a representation of what haunts and frightens us in our actual lives. I also talked with the director about the work of Cinematographer Andrew Shulkind, who certainly deserves a considerable share of the credit for the overall impact of ""The Ritual"". Shulkind's keen eye consistently captures scenes and shots that practically serve as additional characters in the film. Bruckner shared that he and Shulkind teamed up to ""work around the edges"" of the action to deftly reveal dynamics and motivations between the characters not expressly brought to bear. Bruckner directed one of the segments of 2015's multi-plotted ""Southbound"", of which I am not a fan. That said, here, at least in one guy's opinion, is a talent who is both growing and maturing as an artist. ""The Ritual"" operates in an entirely new league of depth and sure-footedness. It is intriguing to see where Bruckner's career behind the lens takes him from here. Indications are that it is a future progressing with promise ""northbound"".",325,15,15,False

imdb_the_ritual_samanthagiavia_20180221,The Ritual,IMDb,samanthagiavia,2018-02-21,3,"Nothing new, predictable, boring and pointless.","You can always tell horror movie fans from regular movie watches. We're the ones not giving this raving reviews. The entire time I watched this move I thought it was a work of Eduardo Sánchez one of the minds behind ""The Blair witch Project"". The monster in this movie looked almost like the monster at the end of ""Lovely Molly"" and that movie also had some strange theme with Deers and Trees. ""The Ritual"" has the lost in the woods story line. Where a group of friend go hiking/camping whatever and get lost in some mysterious woods but in this movie they find a cabin with strange ritual stuff in it and later find themselves being stalked by some sort of forest creature. That has the power of illusion. Well that little paragraph sounded more interesting than it was actually executed. It goes more like a group of friends spend time arguing in the woods when they become lost. (Typical) The group is mixed up of the complainer, the know it all mercenary woodsman, some random guy whose obviously there to get killed off first and the main character. They walk and they walk and they walk in the woods and they complain and they argue and they argue. (We've seen this in every lost in the wilderness movie it and it's been done to death although I will say I did like that movie where the couple gets lost and the guy gets eaten by a bear after they get in an argument I think it was called ""Backcountry"".) So if you get the jest of it the characters you barely get to know them aside from them arguing with each other and therefore you don't have a reason to care what happens to them. What does happen in the movie is pretty much the Blair witch with strange ritualistic symbols, the group members having strange behavior or whatever after sleeping in the cabin. A majority of the movie plays out like the Blair Witch except you actually get to see the monster but not too well since it's mostly hidden in darkness. The creature for the duration of the movie is only sound and all you hear are its shrieks and noises while it picks off the group 1 by 1 for whatever reason it's never explained. It doesn't eat them it guts them and puts them in trees. 3/4's into the film and finally the story picks up and there's a village of strange people that worship this creature. The movie becomes WICKER MAN. at this point. Except the creature is real and actually takes the villagers offerings of people. There is one thing though it marks people it values as worthy of worshiping it and won't kill them as long as the chosen bow to it. The story gets annoying at this point. There's a clean space to tell a back story or any story like why are all these people living in the middle of no where? Why do they worship the creature and how did they all get there? Can they ever leave the woods? All we know is that they all have marks on their chest. There's also a random scene and how can I forget this scene. The main character is captured to be sacrificed or converted to their religion or whatever and he breaks free. When he breaks free he goes to the worshiping area of the place they're holding him at and there are corpses sitting in the room like it's a church. The head scratcher is that the corpses are alive and they talk in whispers and shrieks. WHAT? WHY? & HUH? it's never explained what that room is or why there are corpses in there or why the corpses are alive somewhat. You would think in typical horror twist action that the congregation of corpses would be the villagers and the villagers are actually ghost but they're not. The Villagers are seen running about after their church of corpses is burnt by the main character. The creature reappears and attacks one of the villagers that was kneeling to it. This made no sense when the same villager told the main character that if you kneel to it that it won't hurt you. Guess that went out the window quickly she gets killed. The man character escapes fires a shot at the creature it chases him and gropes him or something it didn't look too kosher, then the main character attacks the creature runs out the woods to the safety zone and screams and yells at the creature showing his fierceness and that he won. Then a car is seen driving in the background (an Uber to pick up up?) to symbolize that the main character made it to safety I guess and then end story. Crap crap crap! I thought maybe I missed something in this movie. Maybe this movie was like ""Mr. Babadook"" and the creature in this was to symbolize something deep and meaningful like ""Regret"" or ""Remorse"" and the main character over came it in the end. That would sound great except nothing the monster does would fit with that theme. I also forgot the other running theme. The main character's friend was killed while he hid behind a shelf and was too afraid to rush in and help his friend. So the rest of the group blames him for the guy dying. Yeah whatever. This was dumbest plot idea to balance this movie around. First of all the guys friend was outnumbered 3 to 1 with one guy holding a knife, one a bat and the other guy in the distance. There was nothing the main character could have done except get himself killed also but they seem to run it into the ground that he didn't bother to help his friend and hid instead. 3/10 for this movie.

A shortcut through a forest turns into a nightmare for the friends when they find themselves hunted by an unseen creature which is worshipped as a god by the woodland folk. Four friends on a vacation that goes horribly wrong: shades of Deliverance, but with a distinct Blair Witch folk horror vibe. The Ritual is all about the unseen terror that lurks just out of sight as opposed to graphic gore and cheap jump scares, director David Bruckner making the most of his extremely atmospheric forest locale, every creepy shadow and spooky sound adding to the suspense. Tension rises as the friends slowly realise that they are in deep doo-doo, with Dom (Sam Troughton) eventually addressing the elephant in the room: Luke (Rafe Spall) doing nothing to try and save Robert on the night he died. Superb performances from the four leads, smart direction, excellent locations, stunning cinematography and a genuinely unsettling set-up make for a superb little low-budget chiller. Special effects are kept to a minimum, but when the creature is finally revealed, it's a really cool looking beastie, like a mutant elk with human arms attached to its face (and other features that are less distinct, which make it all the more disturbing). Just as dangerous are the scary Swedes who revere the monster, and who are instrumental in the deaths of Luke's pals, who are offered up as sacrifices.

Apart from anything else, they come to honour the memory of deceased pal Robert (Paul Reid). Luke (Rafe Spall) holds himself responsible for his friend's death (there's a constant melancholy behind his eyes) and there is an underlying animosity from the others because of the incident. This fuels some friction between the group, who otherwise swap some genuinely funny banter and are a believably close-knit gang of long-term friends. We have sensible Hutch (Robert James Collier), whinging Dom (Sam Troughton) and pessimist Phil (Arsher Ali) – finely drawn out characters played to perfection. The first two thirds of the film concentrate on a slow-burning realisation that they are far from alone in this vast, oppressive, beautiful wilderness. They suffer, do these lads, with some pretty gruesome and hallucinogenic set-pieces. This is Blair Witch 'turned up to 11' in many ways, and is genuinely creepy. The final third concentrates on Luke and the weird community of locals he meets. This is a comparatively rushed second act – we never really know the locals (only Sara, played by Maria Erwolter, has any decipherable lines). The creature responsible for the varied graphic happenings isn't revealed until late on, but is highly impressive. I think that apart from the location, the sound design is the star here. There are some truly gut-wrenching noises and jump scares that don't rely on the over-used screeching violin/Psycho-scare noises that soundtracks often saturate scary moments with. The whole production sounds incredible. And it looks overwhelming too - David Bruckner directs beautifully throughout. For anyone who has read the book, there may be disappointment at the moments that have been excised. I won't expand on that – both book and film are more than worth your time, with neither simply a re-tread of the other – but it is interesting to compare and contrast. Ultimately, I really enjoyed this. The build-up, in both character and horror, is exceptional.

And, if i may say something in general about the ending, the audience gets closure for once. The story centers around Luke, one of 4 English blokes who are planning to hike in Sweden. The conflict within Luke is that he committed an act of cowardice. You see, there were 5 friends once, but Robert was brutally killed during a Liquor store robbery while Luke watched and hid, he did nothing, and nobody else knows. Spoilers ahead, don't read if you haven't seen the movie. The other blokes are Hutch, he is the leader, level headed, and makes most of the decisions.

Ironically he takes command of the group for a short stint later. The group soon learns they are lost and take shelter. They wake next morning extremely disoriented. They all experienced night mares. This goes on for another day, and another, all the while they are breaking down. Still lost in the forest. They realize there is an entity toying with them. That's not all, they see evidence of people in the area, there are marked paths and shacks. There is a reason the entity is toying with the men. Its an ancient Norse creature. It requires disciples to feed it sacrifices, and serve as slaves. These human disciples of the entity are a dozen or so creepy Swedish hill-billies. Turns out they don't age, or age very slowly. But their numbers have been dwindling over the centuries. The entity needs a new recruit to do its bidding. It feeds off of an energy obtained from those who unwittingly enter the woods, are captured and presented ritualistically as a sacrifice. The creature tested, and toyed with the minds of the hikers in the forest like lab rats. Then the entity proceeds to get rid of the candidates that are not suitable, Hutch is too well grounded, Phil too meek, and religious. Dom actually has a back bone. So they are mind flayed and killed one by one at various times in the story. That leaves Luke, he's perfect, the entity has already determined through the mind melding tests and group observation that Luke would likely serve for a millennium or so just to save his skin. Remember he is a selfish, weak minded coward. This is the conflict within Luke. He knows why he was chosen. He has a chance to redeem himself. He knows there is no future as a slave to this creature.

The middle part of the movie didn't really feel as interesting for me, people were disappearing but we didn't actually get to see the chase. So I was just like 'whoop! There goes another one, next!' I wasn't really scared for any of the characters. It got more interesting once they found the village in the last 30min or so but unimaginative as well. I wish either the lore was explained earlier, or the movie had 10 extra minutes at the end where the creature or its worshipers did some disturbing things. The language barrier helped the movie, the Swedish chanting added the eeriness to it. The creature delivered in its appearance. Definitely something that could haunt your nightmares, probably one of the coolest designs I've ever seen. My favorite is still the aliens from a quiet place.

If you aren't sure whether the read is worth it, if you care for a slow burn with an immersive world, challenging characters you still somehow empathize with, perfectly vivid imagery, and a bonkers on and off edge of your seat final hundred or so pages, I would recommend the book. They are very different in some ways and easily comparable in others. The transition from page to screen, or vice versa, is jarring. The film is, in my opinion, an impressive adaptation, and certainly among my favorite translations in general. Extended review: I am so glad that the movie The Ritual (screenplay by Joe Barton, directed by David Bruckner) became a cult classic. Around 2018, a year after its release, I decided it wasn't worth a chance after around ten minutes of the film. I'm not entirely sure why as they effortlessly set the tone for intensity. After re-visiting it October of 2022, it jumped to my top five favorite horror movies. With realistic dialogue and characters in fantastical circumstances, it draws you into the Swedish wilderness all the more. The cast are perfect for their parts, particularly Rafe Spall as Luke and Sam Troughton as Dom. Spall captures book Luke very well. I hope to see Rafe Spall lead in more horror films if that is a route he would like to take. He's got a great deal of talent. And while Dom is an annoying character, Sam Troughton is able to portray him as lovable even with his persistent complaining throughout the trek. Anyone else may not have been able to bring along those redeeming qualities. The Ritual (2011), written by Adam Neville, starts right up and slows similarly to in the film, though caught in vastly different kickoff circumstances. The book does not feature the entire first twenty-five or so minutes of the film, which makes for a dramatic change. The film and book share themes of grief and ancestral, religious, and dramatic horror. One theme more strongly represented in the film is hurt masculinity. And one theme the book drives further is a descent into insanity. All in all, they are separate art pieces. I find that I, myself, prefer the film as a horror piece and find the world of the book - characters and setting - to be superior as I always do for the books because we spend more time getting to know everything so it ultimately makes for a more emotional experience, though it's safe to say the film is still effective. Both the book and the movie have their strong suits and neither's weak outweighs its greats. I recommend The Ritual.",474,8,3,False

Did we need the hillbillies? Did we need four main characters, when two would have done just fine, and the other two are there for no purpose whatsoever, other than to take part in the 'let's bicker endlessly' bits? Oh, yes, this film makes it clear from very early on that it's gonna throw at you everything you hate about horror films. Stupid decisions that not even a moron would make abound, and they often take place after a scene where characters needlessly bicker and try to outdo each other in acting like they are mentally challenged. There is also a backstory to the situation characters find themselves in, which kind of echoes the one from 'The Descent', but has zero payoff. One gets the impression that the writers wanted to do a by-the numbers horror film about taking the wrong path in the woods, but then decided they would do something original by piling up plot elements until the plot collapses under their weight. By the time we reach the climax of the film, you just don't care any more. It's 'Blair Witch' meets 'Hills Have Eyes' meets generic monster, and as we reach the final sequence, we realise the writers had no idea where this train was going. The ending is confusing tonally, logically, emotionally... I couldn't even follow the action, to be frank. And of course, there is the question: How did Swedish hillbillies who never leave a forest learn fluent English? Also, does the Swedish police treat that forest as one of the diverse 'no-go zones' in the big cities, and never investigate all the cases of people wandering in and never coming out?

If you're interested in the opinion of a literature professor, then read on. If you don't, then don't. This review was much better the first time I wrote it, before it got erased. When the story first opens, we see Luke witnessing his friend's murder at the hands of store robbers. Luke does not act, he sits silently, warning his friend not to act defiantly, and frozen in inaction himself. Later, in the forest, each friend begins to have visions or nightmares, over time, the nightmares no longer occur while they are sleeping. Luke's visions are always of the terror-filled events of the convenience store; we get a sense he will never really leave it. We know that he has become a sort of half-man; he seems distant from the group, a point driven home when his friends confirm to his face that they believe him to be a coward and to various extents, no longer a friend, part of the manly comeraderie. Each time we see his store-vision, we notice that the topography of the forest has encroached more and more on the scene, as this incident overtakes the murder of his friend as the worst thing that ever happened to him. As Luke becomes more and more ""present"" in this current situation (instead of living in the past), his friends become more and more dependent on him to guide them, to be a scout for them, to be the sole survivor of the group, and in the end, to avenge them. Luke, out of all four men, was chosen as worthy by the god to join the ranks of his worshippers. He is the singular one, the character most developed. (If you want to go down this rabbit hole, Greek drama tells us that it's the character who has experienced the most pain who is the most developed, surpassing even the gods themselves in compassion and therefore, perfection.) When the god itself faces him (excellent imagination of a Nordic god-monster, BTW), it forces Luke down into a prone worship stance I believe 3 times, a significant number in storytelling; it shows that the protagonist has surpassed his issues and has chosen this act very deliberately. Luke stands defiantly in the face of the fear-god itself, successfully, even wounding it to demonstrate his superiority to it. He leaves the forest, also leaving the convenience store behind with it (notice the lack of store imagery in this ending scene), and turns and screams at The Fear as loudly as he can, again 3 times, in a perfect foil to his silence and inaction in the first scene which froze his life in terror and shame. He leaves the forest and drops his weapon, which he will no longer need. I don't see much of any other way to see this movie, but I literally just finished watching it.

I had heard others talking about it so me and my fiance decided to watch it. What we saw kept me and her on our toes; however, there were a couple of flaws that stopped this one from being really good and turned it into just a pretty good horror film. The atmosphere is great in this one so that is not one of them. I also enjoyed the setting. No, the main flaw I had with it was near to the end as it kind of took away from some of the film and it made little to no sense in other areas. Still, there was some great build up at the beginning of the film and it had me wondering what was going on, at the end though there was just some things that made me wonder what the heck the deal was. The story has a group of friends wanting to take a trip and they think they have it decided when two liquor store where one of the friends is killed in a robbery. Flash a few months later and the remaining friends do the trip they were planning on doing as a tribute to their departed friend. Well, things are going well, that is, until one of them suffers a sprain. Instead of keeping to the path, or sending one of the three remaining who are healthy for help, they decide to do the most horror thing you can do, cut through the woods because it would cut the distance in half. Makes sense, cause woods are so easy to maneuver and staying on the path would be too hard for the friend with the sprain to traverse, better to take him through woods that have sticks, holes and all manner of things to trip on. Well, they enter the woods and soon it is becoming dark, meaning the whole shortcut is already not all that short of a cut. In the house they find a strange room and they also have bad dreams and it isn't too long after that, that something seems to begin stalking the men. They begin to know they are being stalked and soon they must try to get out of the woods and to safety before all of them get picked off! One of the main flaws I found with the story is the whole introduction of the village as there just was not enough time spent to really develop this portion of the story and it just seemed to take away from the rest of the film. I thought the film kind of went downhill during this portion, though it was still alright. I am still also not sure what the point of the one room that was set on fire was as it had like weird straw people that never were really explained. So, the film did have a great build up, develop and explain a few more things at the end and it would have been a better film in my book. The acting in it is pretty good and I liked the setting in the woods and the abandoned cabin they ran across as these places really created a nice creepy atmosphere.

It's very disappointing to see a movie that has a massive potential to blow our minds away but then it all falls apart unnecessarily on the third act.

You're then immersed into a magnificently scenic, yet eerie mountain forest setting where the atmosphere is incredibly effective. I cannot say enough about the beautiful imagery and camerawork throughout. As everything unravels it becomes an outstandingly creepy and suspenseful turn of events unlike anything you've seen before. They executed the big reveals towards the final frightening half hour brilliantly and thats where this horror film rises above so many with its extremely unnervingly bizarre conclusion that you will never see coming.

This kind of scenario is inherently creepy, tapping on ancestral fears everyone can relate tp; however, it often devolves into tedium: see the recent Blair Witch and its ninety minutes of people screaming in pitch black. The Ritual pulls it off. This tale of four friends lost in a Swedish forest as a mysterious creature stalks them features solid direction, strong acting, an original monster in both visual design and lore. The first half is excellent, with an effective urban prologue setting up a tragic event involving main character Luke (Rafe Spall), then an ominous atmosphere as the protagonists take a disastrous shortcut in the wilderness, notice the first unsettling traces of the monster and seek shelter in an abandoned cabin. In the second part things get a little repetitive; the film never lost my interest but it could have used more variety before the last act - say, an abandoned village with other signs of the creature's cult and predations. The Ritual also lacks defining set-pieces after the disturbing prologue and the sinister cabin scene; characters are dispatched in generic, unmemorable ways. This needed an iconic ""Dallas crawling into the air shaft"" moment. Finally, in spite of Spall's effective performance, Luke's character arc feels... unfinished. It's impossible to explain in detail without MAJOR SPOILERS, so beware. Luke's flaw is cowardice, as he abandons a friend in need at the beginning. The ending really should have been about him sacrificing himself for his last surviving pal... who instead gets killed while Luke is unable to help. Then Luke refuses to surrender and manages to escape. END SPOILERS It still kind of works, but it's not as powerful as it could have been if it had evolved more organically to its full narrative payoff.

One wants to go here, another wants to go there, and there is no consensus. One of the members pushes the idea of going for a hike in Switzerland close to its border with Norway, and the idea isn't any more popular than any of the others. They leave the pub and while walking away one of them decides he hasn't had enough to drink and wants to go into a nearby liquor store. For some reason which isn't clear, he really wants one of the others to go with him. I'm guessing for some kind of moral support like ladies wanting to go to the bathroom en masse. Unfortunately, what the two men don't know is that the liquor store is currently being robbed and the man who volunteered to accompany the one who wanted to buy a bottle is brutally killed in the course of the robbery. So the four remaining buddies decide to go for a hike in Switzerland to honor their fallen comrade and the next scene we see is of the men camping and hiking in a somewhat desolate looking and overcast (apparently Swiss) countryside. They hold a brief ceremony around small rock cairn with a photograph, a few odd appropriate objects and a little booze in memory of their friend, and then proceed on their way. Not long after, the smallest of the men, and apparently one with a reputation of being generally disagreeable, falls and sprains his leg. With this added impediment to their forward progress, the men decide to take a shortcut through ""The Forest"" (cue ominous music) in the hopes that the crippled member will be able to cover the shorter distance successfully. Very shortly after entering the dense forest, things begin to go wrong. The forest is unusually and eerily quiet. And then... They come upon the carcass of a very large deer that is not only dead and freshly disemboweled, as evidenced by the still-dripping blood, but oddly splayed out and mysteriously placed high up in the trees. What killed it? Why was it disemboweled like this? And how did it get so far up in the trees? Whatever is out there the men want no part of it and waste no time in leaving the carcass behind. If only it was that easy. But there is something in the forest that's after them. Whatever it is, it's big... it's supernatural... and it's pissed. I live on a fairly steady diet of horror/supernatural movies. I do try to augment my intake with the occasional science-fiction movie as opportunity permits, but it's mostly the purposefully scary pictures for me. Tragically, while there is no dearth of spooky movies, the vast majority are utter rubbish. Apparently, however, it's quite possible to make a decent monster picture without breaking the budget as THE RITUAL clearly illustrates. It isn't perfect and it has the occasional problem but it's definitely a quality example of its genre. While not Academy Award material, because horror pictures almost never win Academy Awards on general principle, the production design is excellent, the music appropriate, the acting sufficient to purpose, and so on. One of the unavoidable obligations of a monster picture, supernatural or otherwise, is the payoff of the monster at the end. How good is the monster and is there a satisfactory explanation about its origins? This is most frequently the element where most monster pictures drop the ball. While there are those that seem to take issue with it, in my opinion THE RITUAL comes across with a perfectly good and scary monster that's entirely appropriate for a creepy old forest and I commend the makers of the movie for giving us something pretty darn original into the bargain. The only really negative note I have is that the creature evidently has the ability to cause horrifying visions in the minds of its targeted victims as well as other mind influencing games. The vision we see repeatedly is that of the liquor store robbery in which their friend was killed as viewed by the character who feels personal guilt over that death. We also see a vision of one of the member's wife supplanting the approaching monster in the sacrifice scene. What role these visions play was never clear to me and seems to me to have been added to the movie simply for unexplained effect. But, all in all, if you are into horror pictures, especially of the scary monster variety, THE RITUAL is a definite must-see.",787,17,15,True

For example, there is a dude getting stabbed in the chest while daydreaming/hallucinating, dude ignores it totally and keeps heading on like nothing ever happend. In my opinion the difference between a 1-5 rating and a 6-10 rating is explaining (with a very good reason) why he ignores getting stabbed. Explain why that monster is killing people? Why can't a bullet hurt him but an axe can. Why doesn't he kill the main character (Rafe Spall) at once like the other characters. Was the monster also tired being in this movie? And then the ending.

My biggest issue with the movie is the characters. I don't think the first couple of scenes in Britain really add anything and the picture would have worked better just having the friends go without emotional baggage.

And there is actually a reference to the Appalachians early on in this movie. But it isn't set in West Virginia. It's a British Netflix movie, and it's mostly set in the deep forests of northern Sweden. The movie starts with five old college buddies in London planning what seems to be an annual vacation together. After rejecting a number of ordinary, expected hum-drum options, they decide on a hiking trip in Sweden. Tragically, before leaving, one of them is horribly murdered in a liquor store holdup while another watches but escapes unharmed. So you have ""survivor's guilt"" set up from the very start. The remaining four go ahead with the hiking vacation, and it turns into something quite unexpected. This is an effectively creepy movie pretty much from the moment that the group arrives in Sweden. Originally walking a known trail, after one of them hurts a knee they decide on a shortcut back to their lodge through the forest. Of course, you should never, ever take a shortcut through the forest! Not in West Virginia. Not in Sweden. And especially not in a movie. Strange things begin to happen. There are noises - footsteps and growls - and from time to time they catch a fleeting glimpse of - something big. Then they come across freshly gutted bodies hung high in trees. Breaking into a cabin they discover they find a sort of altar. What is going on? In truth, for a while I was wondering if any of it was real. Luke had experienced a huge trauma when he witnessed the murder of his friend. Was this a dream or a nightmare or a hallucination of his? But it wasn't. It was very real, and very horrible, and there really was a hideous creature roaming the woods that a local group (don't know if they were inbred or not) worshipped as some sort of offspring of the Norse gods. This movie certainly held my attention the whole way through. It was a good decision not to give us a good look at the creature until close to the end of the movie. That heightened the suspense and creepiness. I'd quibble a bit with the need for the murder of one of the guys in the opening scenes of the movie (and, yes, I realize it's based on a book so it's following the basic outline) but I think the story would have worked just as well if it had been five guys on a hiking trip through Sweden and not just four.

Which brings me to the idea of the plot as a kind of allegory. I'm a former English teacher, so... cut me some slack about that. The WOODS (caps intentional) are a foreboding place. Viewers know that the group should not take a shortcut through the woods - but they also know that, indeed, they must, or there wouldn't be a movie. Once inside those Woods, the viewer is constantly reminded of that... EVENT... from the beginning of the movie. Clearly, there is significance.

Quite assertive, and well-done for what it wants to be; A leisured atmospheric rural creature-feature horror with a mysteriously eerie occult framework using simple, if cookie-cutter mechanics to invoke growing unease and instinctive terror. The acting is solid, and the script holds tight. It does enough with the character dramas to keep the lost-in-the-woods story dynamics moving forward, even throwing psychological shade over fractured mindsets when the good-hearted bickering turns harmfully personal. I didn't think it always worked, but it gave the story an extra dimension to squeeze out the emotional tension, provide motivations and the ability to show this creature can mentally manipulate the minds of those it stalks. Another element working to its favour was the dark, sprawling mountainous forest becoming a character in itself. The way the camera captures the surroundings and how the audio picks up on the creature moving through the lush vegetation (branches snapping to the off-screen growling) gives off a spooky ambiance that at anytime can swallow you up, or inflict a gruesome surprise. As for the monster (an ancient evil), I actually liked the Norse old-world folklore and unique camouflage design whenever we got the chance to see it. This does come to fruition in the outlandish descent of its third act, where I think it loses a bit something when it breaks out.

The film follows a tried-and-true horror film scenario of four friends getting lost in the wilderness and all hell breaking loose. Overall it was actually one of the better horror films I've seen in awhile. The movie by no means reinvented the wheel in its concept and borrowed heavily from film classics such as The Blair Witch Project, Deliverance, Wicker Man, and The Descent. That being said it was a very well made horror movie. The movie did a great job using sound to create genuine moments of suspense and intrigue. The film also made excellent use of the wilderness setting to craft a thick and eerie atmosphere. To compliment the setting the film also intentionally doled out plot details in small increments. This really helped to keep you on the edge of your seat about what was going to happen next in the movie. I never felt bored during the movie, even though the plot points felt familiar. A big plus for me was also the lack of jump-scares. All of the horror elements and scares felt natural instead of the forced in your face jump-scare. It's refreshing to see a horror movie rely on more than cheap tricks to scare its audience. The film did have its issues though. In some ways the film felt like it was two separate productions. Without giving anything away the first half of the film and the second went in connected but different directions. Also, again this was not the most original movie. Neither of these points really took away from the enjoyment of the movie, but it does keep this film away from being a classic. The Ritual was all around a solid horror experience. It was well made, acted, and most importantly provided ample scares. Despite its unoriginality it certainly entertained, a 7.5 out of 10.",315,1,1,False

It starts off with five friends drinking and having fun in a pub, talking about where they want to go on a vacation. On their way back Rob and Luke decide to enter a store to buy some alcohol. While inside they see two muggers coming out of the back room. Luke manages to hide while Rob gets caught by them. Refusing to give up his wedding ring he gets beaten up and dies. Fast forward 6 months and we see the four remaining friends go on a hiking trip trough Scandinavia. I was very surprised with the creativity of this movie. Both in a positive and negative way. The first part of the movie was very suspenseful, unnerving and it constantly makes you feel like something is not right. What I loved about it most was the way the main plot was mixed along with the ""side plot"" so to say about the rising tension between the friends, them trying to connect and move on and how that all unfolds under such circumstances. However as much as I enjoyed it, there were still some issues with the film that almost ruined it for me. Most of the characters were not fully developed and most of the story was focused on Luke which is a shame since it was obvious that the actors had great chemistry and their stories could have been expanded. There was also a definitive shift in the movie which almost ruined the movie for me since it changes the style of the movie from making it a tense, psychological journey of friends who despite the obvious grudges they hold against each other try to ease the tension and get trough the sureal landscape of the forest to a predictable second half with a (mild spoiler alert) small group of villagers who capture them to sacrifice them to an ancient Nordic monster which to be fair had an amazing design. In the end I would say that the pros outweigh the cons and despite all its flaws it still is a movie that deserves to be watched.

It makes its characters act in such stupid manners that it feels like their actions have no other meaning than to forcefully keep them in the dark forest where they can be scared. Any other course of action would jeopardize the film itself. The Ritual is about a group of friends who go on a hiking trip to Swedish wilderness in order to honor the memory of one their friend who was killed in a liquor store robbery. There is unspoken air of judgement amongst them since one of them was present when he was killed, only hiding behind a shelve. The little remembering ritual is performed right at the beginning, and then it's time to hike their way to the nearest lodge. And then things start to go wrong. One of them spruces his ankle and complains that he won't be able to make the marked way through the high hills, so they must go through a thick and dark forest. That's only the first, and maybe the least dumb decision they are about to make. It all follows a typical horror movie style. They have strange dreams, encounters and they do insane things when they sleep, which they can't explain or don't remember doing. Even after the first night spent in the woods the sanest thing to do would be to turn back, bad leg or not. Yet, the movie insists to proceed on the road it has chosen. But in order to that, it must force its characters to act in more and more delusional and frankly idiotic manner that frustrated me. Otherwise there wouldn't really be a movie here. With Swedish wilderness as the backdrop, you might expect a horror film relying on some Scandinavian folk tale. Well, there is one, but sadly it's kept mostly nothing more than a backdrop. Whatever message it's trying to relay with the ancient god-like deer creature that grants its followers eternal life, it feels very disconnected with what the group of friends are doing and what they're going to through. If the connecting piece here is that the creature only chooses as his followers those who have gone through something traumatic or have a deep dug guilt, then it's a very loose connection. The ritual has some effective atmospheric moments in it, and it doesn't rely on cheap jump scares. The scariest moment being the first night they spent in a cabin in the middle of the woods. But the even the effect of the atmosphere diminishes towards the end as the film lays all its card on the table. Nothing is left to the imagination when the creature stalking the woods is shown in full and even its story is told straight to the viewer.

It made the reason they were there more interesting and did away with the Norwegian HM angle which was drivel. Once they got into the forest the pace picked up and the conclusion was better than the book. The claustrophobic remoteness of the forest was presented well by good use of the trees and there were some really interesting camera angles. The monster was introduced gradually until the reveal in the finale and the finished product was pretty good. It wasn't particularly scary but did have some good unsettling moments that were effective. The characters were decent enough although it would have been better if the film was 20 or 30 minutes longer as we never really get to know a great deal about them. The book was better in that respect. The same for the folks in the cabin. We never really got to understand why they were there and what was going on. Again the book was better here. The ending did seemed rather rushed and with 20 minutes to go a lot had still to happen. Not really a horror more a good thriller with some weirdness thrown in.

imdb_the_ritual_foxtrotdestroyer225_20250907,The Ritual,IMDb,FOXTROTDESTROYER225,2025-09-07,9,A Modern Folk Horror Gem,"The Ritual is one of those rare horror films that knows exactly how to blend psychological tension with supernatural terror. What makes it stand out isn't just the monster lurking in the Scandinavian woods, but the grief and guilt carried by the characters-especially Luke, whose trauma from his friend's death bleeds into every moment of the story. The horror here is as much internal as it is external, and that's what makes it stick. The atmosphere is phenomenal. The forest itself feels alive, oppressive, and indifferent-a labyrinth of branches and shadows where reality bends. Director David Bruckner uses sound, silence, and camera movement to make the audience feel trapped right alongside the characters. Every creak, every twig snapping in the distance, every symbol carved into a tree piles on the unease. The creature design is jaw-dropping-easily one of the most unique and disturbing monsters in recent memory. But the beauty is that the movie doesn't just throw it at you for cheap scares. Its slow-burn reveals, paired with the disturbing Norse mythology, build dread until the final confrontation feels both terrifying and inevitable. What really elevates the film, though, is the writing. The characters don't feel like stock horror victims; their banter, their anger, their fear-it all feels raw and authentic. Their fractured friendship adds layers to the tension, so when the horror comes, it feels personal rather than random. Add in some sharp cinematography and haunting imagery, and you've got a folk horror film that lingers long after the credits roll. For me, The Ritual is a near-perfect modern horror: atmospheric, unsettling, and emotionally resonant. A 9/10 that proves you don't need constant jump scares when the forest itself can swallow you whole.",284,2,0,False

Nothing can go wrong with that, right? The Netflix original 'The Ritual' follows the story of this crew as they hike in honor of their fallen buddy as a final remembrance of sorts, and predictably, things don't go quite according to plan. 'Ritual' is pretty heavy, as the relationship between the four friends is tested in many ways. There's plenty of psychological spooks littered throughout the film, most of which are pretty well executed. This doesn't make up for the many scenes that feel like they're direct rip-offs of the much superior 'The Blair Witch Project,' though. Still, the stress and strain on these friends feels real; important because at the end of the day, it's the four actors (Rafe Spall, Arsher Ali, Robert James-Collier, Sam Troughton) on whose shoulders everything rests.

The Plot = Four friends reunite for a hiking trip to Sweden in memory of their deceased friend. However, once they take a shortcut through the wilderness, they encounter a menacing presence that begins to stalk them. Directed by David Bruckner and based upon the 2011 novel of the same name by Adam Nevill, this movie is brought to life gorgeous cinematography and restrained and subtle direction which emotes waves of quite and unnerving dread in a highly effective way and the entire aesthetic moves from stunning to nightmarish with such ease in way that catches you off-guard. The movie may not be the most original folk horror film out there nor does it fully reach the potential of its themes due to some of its momentum being lost in the final act, but it's still a strong case study in less is more with its striking creature design, tragic human drama and compelling mythology which doesn't reveal its entire mystery aspect makes this a rather timely and effective genre flick nonetheless. The cast here are top-notch with Rafe Spall giving a captivating and mesmerizing leading performance as Luke and anchors the entire production rather well. Sam Troughton gives a solid and memorable performance as Dom. Arsher Ali and Robert James Collier delivers realistic and captivating performances in their respective roles and rounds out the cast nicely.

Will any of them make it out alive? This is basically a meshing of ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) and ""Ogre"" (2008), but without the tongue-in-cheekiness of the latter. There's also a little bit of ""The Wicker Man"" (1973/2006). Like ""Blair Witch"" the foul-mouthed protagonists become increasingly horrified in the foreboding forest and eventually turn on one another. But the sylvan cinematography is leagues superior due to the spectacular Romanian locations as opposed to the pedestrian film-work of ""Blair Witch"" in Maryland (which is understandable since the latter is a ""found-footage"" flick). I'm not going to give-away the creature, which isn't fully revealed until the last fifteen minutes, but it's basically a hybrid of the monsters in ""The Relic"" (1997) and ""Wendigo"" (2001), albeit bigger, and superior to both. The second half deviates from the book and people complain about it, but it's superior to the lame black metal cult of the book IMHO and you can't beat one potent sequence that smacks of hell-on-earth. There's also an intriguing element about achieving nigh-immortality at the price of submissive veneration.

This latest effort is directed by David Bruckner, who did ""Amateur Night, ""easily the best segment in any of the V/H/S films, and a forgettable Bella Thorne Amityville sequel that debted on GooglePlay. It's based on a pretty solid novel and, for the first half, stays true to the source material. The second, simply put, does not. Is this movie good? Sure, not great, but solid enough and not as bad as some of Netflix's other original features. Is it as good as the book though? No. The story is the same. A group of old pals from Britain nearing middle age hike off the beaten patch in the Netherlands and end up lost, having to brave bad weather and carry an ornery and injured mate along the way. And there's this THING stalking them. They find mounting evidence of pagan rituals, mutilated animals in trees, and evidence that the locals, if there are any at all, may not be eager to help. The acting is solid enough, although I didn't recognize a single name in the movie. The film is exceedingly well shot, capturing the claustrophobic dread of being hopelessly lost in wild. The effects are good as well. The downside is that the characters are weak and because this is such a character piece, it just causes the whole movie to fall a little flat. Then there's s the third act.

The Ritual is neither. It's an attempt to fit a well-known architype of Horror, which neither succeeds nor fails, but it close enough to be more entertaining than disappointing. Said architype is probably far from new to most viewers: a bunch of friends go hiking a rural unfamiliar environment, and find themselves hunted by something (in this case, that is. In others it's someone). A shared tragedy brings four English friends to rural Sweden. When one of them is injured, they choose to take a shortcut through the woods. During this obvious act of sheer futility, they begin to experience horrible nightmares while being chased by some sort of animal that is always faster than their gaze. Cinematography is actually quite impressive, as the camera follows the protagonists' gazes and not the actual predator, leaving the viewers as confused and frightened as the characters, all share the terrifying predicament of knowing something is out there - but able to see it or know what it exactly is. Unfortunately, the film takes a distinct turn for the worse as we actually see the thing that haunts the woods and are given an unsatisfying, anticlimactic and plain foolish explanation as to its existence. Unnecessary to the point of being abusive. I couldn't help but pitying the writers who obviously felt obligated to offer something new instead of sticking to the script. Bad idea, big mistake. The result is simply damaging to the film and disappointing to the audience, in my opinion. The film wouldn't have been great in any case, but it really could have been good. Instead - it's simply average, mediocre, and just enough entertaining to be worth watching. All in all, everything I've said is my personal opinion. You might think the last part is actually good, even very good. Alternatively, you might think I've been overly generous. All I can recommend is that you watch the trailer and choose for yourselves.
