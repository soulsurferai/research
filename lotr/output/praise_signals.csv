The music and atmosphere is lovely. There isn't voice acting and I'm fine with that. I'm old enough to remember text only video games. Plus pretty sure there wasn't budget for voice acting. 

I was first annoyed with how slow the walking is but a skipping hobbit is adorable. I wish you could say hi to all the npcs, it would help with immersion. Some randomly say something and some you just pass by with no interaction.

It's perfect for a cozy game.

The music and atmosphere is lovely. There isn't voice acting and I'm fine with that. I'm old enough to remember text only video games. Plus pretty sure there wasn't budget for voice acting. 

I was first annoyed with how slow the walking is but a skipping hobbit is adorable. I wish you could say hi to all the npcs, it would help with immersion. Some randomly say something and some you just pass by with no interaction.

It's perfect for a cozy game.

When I saw horses I thought for sure we could have horses 😔,1,2025-07-31 02:34:55+00:00,Honest Opinion,"I’ve played approximately 5 hours rn.

I do not get the criticism for this game. It is cosy, it makes my heart warm. Everything is cute.

Does it lack some aspects? Sure.

For once why did they created this beautifully designed animals and did not give us an option to buy them? I hoped that I was too early on game but the collection part doesnt have animals. It is very sad for me, as when i saw the trailer i was really excited to dress up my ducks… I hope they give the option to have animals in later updates.

Other than this it may be nice to add voices to townfolk.

But other than these i am loving it. I dont have bugs or lagging problems on switch oled. Didnt bought the s2.

Also butterflies and birds guiding us makes me happy. And not running but hopping made me giggle like a toddler.

I love lotr universe and cozy games and this is a great mix up of them.

But it really needs animals!! And maybe transportation option at least to home? But it might kill the vibes so i am not sure.

Please devs, add a little bit more gameplay
P.s : English is not my first or second language so please excuse if i made any mistake

The game is extremely cozy, the art is awesome and I love the drama between some of the characters in Bywater. 

The animals are adorable and interacting with them, just watching them sit or lay down is weirdly very fun lmao.

The bird following system IS a little difficult for me, but I'm sure I'll get used to it. My sense of direction is super bad, so idk if that has something to do with it.

I wouldn't have stopped playing, but my laptop was overheating so I am taking a break from streaming and playing to write this.

I think my only actual complaints are the fact that things do seem to clip through other things and in my opinion the customization of the character could have been better (i.e haircolors etc) and maybe the first proper task was very repetitive (man, so much walking).

— 

Overall, after several hours of play (ps5), I feel like I’m having a lovely, low-stakes experience of living a little hobbit life — the one Frodo would have known and wanted to protect when he went off with the ring. The one he couldn’t truly return to after all he had been through. From that perspective, it’s a lovely gift for a fan :) 

I think this is worth the buy if you’re a lotr fan, and definitely worth the buy if you like cozy games or related life-sim stuff. Just go in knowing it’s the life sim of an average hobbit in the shire, not one of the two-to-five-total hobbits who left to fight dragons or destroy the soul of evil. 

Really, I can’t think of any fictional group better suited to the cozy game genre than hobbits. Their entire existence is silly low-stakes village drama, cheeky little personalities, a love of nature, home, food, crafting, and staying close to your hobbit hole. 

Things I think they did very well outside of the hobbit-y-ness:

1. They got the right details right. I think the physics, lighting, subtle changes in season and flora and fauna that appear, different fish being around at different times of day or different seasons, or certain plants growing better together is all thoughtful cozy game heaven. It’s the right effort in the right places so that even the “cartoony” style fades away into something that feels immersive.

2. Things take “just-enough” work. Fishing takes a little effort, but it’s fun and relatively fast. I’m not sitting waiting 3 minutes do a single dish to bite. You aren’t given nor do you have to make insane amounts of money to decorate your house — you get a little starter set of clothes and a little starter set of home decor options so it actually feels homey, but there’s still incentive to grow.

3. The main metric of forwarding the game is building relationships through hosting meals and I love it. The cooking is probably the most complex thing (in a fun way), but that makes sense for its level of importance in the game.  

4. I feel like a hobbit and this feels like my village. The village is but enough to need some way finding (the birds are cute), but after a while it is small enough that you start to know you way around a bit without being bored — the same way you’d know your way around your own home town. 

5. Most importantly, Weta and crew protected the hobbits. There is (so far) not rings of power horror. The writing, characters, motivations etc. all feel true to a Tolkien-PJ Films idea of a hobbit. Cartoony graphics do not take me out of the world, but a hobbit not being hobbit-y would. Even the dwarf is charming in a dwarf way that made me chuckle and generally every little subtle call-out has made me smile. The hobbits as a whole are really a bit of a caricature of the small idealistic English village inhabitants — so the exaggerated visuals of the game kind of fit for me.

Anyway, happy hobbit-ing :)

The game is extremely cozy, the art is awesome and I love the drama between some of the characters in Bywater. 

The animals are adorable and interacting with them, just watching them sit or lay down is weirdly very fun lmao.

I think my only actual complaints are the fact that things do seem to clip through other things and in my opinion the customization of the character could have been better (i.e haircolors etc) and maybe the first proper task was very repetitive (man, so much walking).

I do dislike reading thread after thread saying the game is objectively bad and insinuating that anyone who likes it is ""part of the problem"" because they feel players who like it are supporting ""lazy games."" If it's not for you, that's okay, but to say that if it's not good for you then it's not good for anyone is a bit narrow-minded. A game is not bad just because it chose a simpler path for players.","Post: I really don’t get the hate for Tales of the Shire about five hours in Comment: I feel for Switch players experiencing bugs and lag that diminish the enjoyment. I play on PC and I can tell the game isn't properly optimized. Steam Deck also has a hard time running it even though it's verified.


That said, I love Tales of the Shire. I enjoy the stories and I'm particularly fond of Nefi and Ladie.

Based my hopes on the fact that I love Return to Moria and it had mixed reviews as well.

The game is extremely cozy, the art is awesome and I love the drama between some of the characters in Bywater. 

The animals are adorable and interacting with them, just watching them sit or lay down is weirdly very fun lmao.

The bird following system IS a little difficult for me, but I'm sure I'll get used to it. My sense of direction is super bad, so idk if that has something to do with it.

I wouldn't have stopped playing, but my laptop was overheating so I am taking a break from streaming and playing to write this.

I think my only actual complaints are the fact that things do seem to clip through other things and in my opinion the customization of the character could have been better (i.e haircolors etc) and maybe the first proper task was very repetitive (man, so much walking).

I'm not generally a cozy game player, but I felt like the atmosphere and setting of this game would go a long way for me! And I am happy to say that I have spent over 30 hours fully engrossed and in love with the game!

That said, I think there are some improvements that can be made. Here's a few I thought of, and I'd love to see anyone else's ideas in the comments!

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

What do you think?

The fact everyone is voiced, they brought in John Rhys-Davies AND your character talks to coop buddies is absolutely top notch.",1,2025-07-30 01:00:31+00:00,1.5 hour review (PS5),"Alright folks, I’ve been playing for about 1.5 hours now since release on PS5. Thus far, I can comfortably say that I am only continuing with the game because of affection for LOTR media. The gameplay seems to be super shallow, which is fine for a cozy game. The world is nice to just exist in and the music is great! 

Now for the rough parts… 

The framerate makes the game almost unplayable for me. It’s 30 fps, however, it has constant stuttering and frame drops on PS5. It effectively plays at lower than 30 fps which is kind of making me feel like I’m having a stroke… 

The lack of voice acting for ANY characters is particularly jarring in 2025. It makes the world feel a bit dead sometimes. My solution has been to just turn the music up and vibe. 

The relationship mechanic only revolving around shared meals is a bit one-dimensional. They should have had multiple ways to engage with other hobbits. 


Overall: I would highly recommend waiting to see if they drop performance patches soon, especially if low frame rates bother you. 

Edit to add: My wife and I are huge cozy game and LOTR fans. This is our most anticipated game of the year so I’m a bit disappointed. However, it has a solid base and I love the art style so I’m hoping they improve it with patches/dlc!

So I don't know if I've like, accidentally been lowering my chances of getting normal furniture by doing well in my meals throughout the game lol.

There's particular furniture sets I want to decorate with, so if I gotta just make some crappier meals to get more of a chance to get these items then I'd love to know.",11,17,"Post: Question about gifts recieved after meals Comment: Omg thank you so much for this, this is exactly the info I was looking for!

For anyone else in the same position, is becoming a village the main story line? As much as I love working through the clubs and doing home decor, it feels a little hollow now that I'm no working towards a main goal!

Wanted to give back my own insights: Playing on the PS5 Pro the controls are okay, I did not encounter any bugs so far but a crash that wiped all my progress from the day I ve been on (20mins) - hoping it doesnt get worse. The performance is definitely not okay. It is okay-ish in some parts but heavily dropping in others - if you are sensitive to chunky fps I would suggest to skip the game in its current state. The story is fine, characters are nice. Sound is very monotonous while the music is okay and the graphics feel not that superb in my opinion to justify such wonky fps. The gameplay itself is my biggest grief because it is indeed getting very boring very fast. I played a lot of gathering, management, farm sims and this game just doesnt have what it takes to keep you going (in my opinion). If you are unsure whether to buy it or not I would say no or wait for a bigger sale.

\---

So I ve been reading mixed stuff about this game since it launched. I am not a huge LotR fan so I dont have any expectations about the game world accuracy. Primarily looking for a cozy game thats worth the time. It is currently on sale again fpr 24,49€ and I was debating on giving it a chance.

Getting some insights from players especially on PS5 or PS5 Pro would be helpful. How does it run? How are the controls? Do you regret buying it or is it worth the price? Any feedback would be great - thanks in advance!",14,20,Post: Considering buying it for PS5 Pro - how is the state of the game?

I’m hoping someone can help because I’m really not good with technology, and this whole situation has been pretty confusing for me.

I’ve been playing Tales of the Shire (digital copy) on my Switch for about a month, and it’s been crashing every few days. Today it stopped opening completely and said corrupt data was found on the microSD card.

I used Check for Corrupt Data, and it did find something — but when I try to redownload the game, I get this message:

&gt; “The download will be cancelled because an error has occurred. Please start the download again from the beginning.”

And sometimes I also get:

&gt; “Unable to access the microSD card. Please turn off the console and reinsert the microSD card.”

I’ve followed those instructions properly (turning the console off through Power Options, removing the SD card, reinserting it, restarting, etc.), but it hasn’t fixed anything. The corrupted data stays there, and the Switch won’t let me reinstall the game.

Here’s what I’ve already tried, just so people know where I’m at:

•Fully restarted the Switch (including holding the power button for a forced shutdown).
•Used Check for Corrupt Data.
•Deleted the software (but not the save data) and attempted a reinstall.
•Removed and reinserted the microSD card as instructed, and also tried installing with the SD card taken out entirely.

A few other things that might matter:

•I’ve only ever had problems with Tales of the Shire — no other game has ever crashed or had issues on my Switch.
•That’s why I’m confused about whether the game is causing this or if the SD card is suddenly failing.
•I’m not getting any useful error codes, just the two messages above.
•I’d be nervous about doing anything complicated like formatting the SD card without someone guiding me, because tech stuff is really not my strong point.


Has anyone had this happen?
Is this a Tales of the Shire issue, or does it sound more like the SD card? And if it is the SD card, what’s the simplest safe way to fix it without risking my save?

I was apparently just being dramatic and have since found a letter from Willow expanding my hobbit hole 🤪,1,2025-08-22 22:57:02+00:00,Willow Level 10 Glitch,"Hi! I reached level 10 with Willow and nothing happened. It shows I have a “tale” level gift to get, but when I talk to Willow nothing pops up besides trading/buying. I haven’t gotten any new rooms in my house since the level 6 unlock. 

However, classic ADHD, I played a few in game days since hitting this glitch, and didn’t even think about it before doing another manual save. In order to go back to before this house glitch happened I’d have to go back to a pretty old backup. I’d give up completing cooking club, and go back about 15 hours of play time. 

So I want to ask those of you who have maxed out Willow’s friendship: is the last room addition worth it? Should I go back, lose that progress and try again to get the last few rooms? Or should I just continue without?",2,3,Post: Willow Level 10 Glitch Comment: Thank you both for replying!

Do you remember one that was harder to find than the rest? I've completed almost everything; all villagers are maxed, foraging is maxed, cooking and fishing are almost lvl 5 and gardening is lvl 3 almost 4. I'm basically just working on the rest of the achievements, meals, and gift collecting while I max out clubs. I'm on my third round of seasons, but I noticed most players get this Collect all Moments achievement before finishing the main quest line that I finished 2 in game years ago. I've covered the map, is there a roof top I missed or a corner view maybe?

To make it clear : It's a cozy game and I went to buy a cozy game.

Pros :
I'm really happy how it turns out !
Music is cute
The scenery is cute
Clothes choice is great
Body choice in character creator is very smart and I'd rather have this type of slide than the ""choose X or Y"" usual thing you get on other ""simple"" char creators.
The cooking mechanic is insanely soothing I don't know why.
I LOVE the home personalization !! So much choices omg yes.
I didn't get Motion Sickness even though I'm quite sensitive to it. Well in those two hours. I hope I don't get it later in game :(

Cons :
I find the rest of the character creator maybe a little bit light - but that's really personal because it's really fine compared to other cozy games. I hope they add at least more hair styles ! Further in game or with patches.
It's not very well optimised on PC, I cannot get over 40FPS with medium graphics even though my computer is far from being a toaster... I hope some patches will fix that !",4,2025-07-29 22:20:57+00:00,"Alright, I bought it.","So far?

I shrugged it off thinking I just imagined things. My garden is very large so I didn’t notice that it wasn’t spinach that got planted ‘til a couple days later. So I went back to buy more seeds (just spinach and its companions) and it happened again. So now I only have a few days left in winter and I haven’t been able to plant any spinach. 
Anyone else dealing with a mysterious veg glitch? 
I’m playing on a switch and it freezes every couple of shire days so I’m having to manual save constantly so I don’t lose anything 😭
I truly love this game but sometimes it’s so frustrating.

Ive tried to be vague where possible and marked post as spoiler to be safe. 

I've now got over 100 hours in game, maxed friendship and pretty much feel done decorating. Here's a few things I wish the game had to give it a bit more quality of life.

Recurring holiday - in wish the day you finish the main story would be a recurring holiday every year, so you can mark thr day and celebrate. Barring that I wish the first day of the year (marking your arrival) would have some embellishments

Place to store non foods - in wish I didnt have to sell every flower or hold space for windfall wood. I wanted to COVER my home in flower pots but it took max friendship with *someone* to get potted flowers. I just wish I could use a storage chest to save them, not necessarily need access to them sooner.

More pocket space - it will always be the main every game I play if my pockets get full. I wish I could earn even more pockets

A door out to the back garden - seriously just need a faster way inside and out the back

That final door - something. Anything. I hate how it looks. I understand if they were going to do something with it but the poor game reception put that on hold. But it doesnt *need* to be there barred like that for that to be the case. Make it a wall, then make it a door later. Im sure thats something someone knows how to do, though I will admit I am not a game developer so I dont truly know how difficult it can be

More conversation - I wish I could just repeat the same dumb chit chat lines instead hi goodbye. Something small. Just enough to make them alive

Pets - i want more pets, the chickens aren't enough and they dont go inside my home 😢

Misc - I wish the flowers in the garden beds didnt appear and disappear as I move my camera around. I wish I could jog or that skipping was ever so slightly faster than walking. I wish I could change the design of the table for meals, and the design of the kitchen counter. I (occasionally) wish I could have multiple meals a day. I wish there were some form of multi-player like inviting another hobbit to a meal so they can visit your village and see your home for a day; though this feels like a very big ask imo. 

I have many other little things I'd like, like more decorations, and stuff along those lines but these seem to be the biggest to me personally. ",69,13,"Post: Quality of Life Comment: Yes!

(Round 2 electric boogalo, 1st post got removed for some reason)","Just gonna re-post this per the reddit mod's suggestion, since my first one got auto-removed for some reason.



I bought the game last week, I was pretty wary of it based on reviews. And holy cow I'm hooked. Currently in the quest line to keep the assessor in town and I've just reached some of my first big rewards for friendship and club task completion.

I do think there are some quality of life aspects that are ... lacking. I've come up with a list of a few things that I might play around with trying to mod in the future. I'm curious to see if anyone else has thought of something I haven't!

* I want to close my doors so I can see the pretty paint job I picked, and shut out the rain
* Show the selling price of items in their description, so I can know whether it's worth scrapping or keeping when my backpack is full.
* 'move all' button form backpack to pantry. Also, a better way to move a whole stack rather than click, change to 9, click again.
* change the aesthetics of my dining room table. Almost everything in the house is customizable except that tablecloth.

Idk if this is moddable, but personally I can't stand the walking animation. It's so loud and distracting, I wish she would just walk smoothly and normally.

ETA more great suggestions, keep them coming!!

* How many days since you had dinner with a hobbit - [u/paulaaaaaaaaa](https://www.reddit.com/user/paulaaaaaaaaa/)
* Name of the plant you are foraging/gardening - [u/Lili\_of\_Legend](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lili_of_Legend/)
* compass on the main screen; color-changing forage-able icons based on availability; description should display how many of that item you own - [u/vaughnerich](https://www.reddit.com/user/vaughnerich/)
* Skip should be faster; pin club quests to the UI; mini map; hobbits should hang around after meals to collect rewards - [u/NulllEins](https://www.reddit.com/user/NulllEins/)
* Woodfall and flower storage (maybe a wood pile and flower baskets?); pantry size upgrade - [u/AnnamAvis](https://www.reddit.com/user/AnnamAvis/)

And you’re right- bitter is the hardest!,16,2025-08-31 14:49:45+00:00,I cooked all meals at 5-star,"After completing this challenge I set for myself, here are some cooking tips I have for early/mid-gamers:
- Bitter dishes are the rarest. 3-star bitter seasonings are harder to come by, so forage and plant more when you can, especially in spring.
- Sweet flavour goes well with everything so sweet seasonings are important. Bitter only goes well with sweet. This brings up the next tip: 
- Prioritise maxing out relationship with Lily Cotton. She could well be one of the most important villagers to max out asap because of her 3-star butter trade at level 10. Butter is important because it is the sweet seasoning to cook with the frying pan, the only way to add seasonings to meat.
- Spicy and salty dishes are incredibly easy to make as long as you have enough black pepper and salt. 
- Sour dishes are incredibly fun to make. Often times you get the flavour from the ingredients without needing to use any sour seasoning. But when you have to, raisin and chives are the most versatile.
- Collect nuts, keep the 2 and 3 stars. Feed the chickens with 1-star.
- Collect berries, keep the 2 and 3 stars. Make jam with the 1-star.

I am okay with the villagers making noises to indicate mood or character but question the ultra feminine sounds that Nefi the dwarve makes. I have no quibble with the character being female mind you but she sounds more Elvish somehow. I like all the hobbit characters and how they sound. 

The day should pass slower, there is barely enough time to get around and explore before it's too late and you have to run home. I have a bit of a lag issue; sometimes it feels like my hobbit is drunk and trying to make it into the house but misses the door! 

I think this is a very ""cozy"" game with the emphasis on socialization and hobbit life. The humor is very charming and true to what I imagine a typical hobbit life would be like.

I am okay with the villagers making noises to indicate mood or character but question the ultra feminine sounds that Nefi the dwarve makes. I have no quibble with the character being female mind you but she sounds more Elvish somehow. I like all the hobbit characters and how they sound. 

The day should pass slower, there is barely enough time to get around and explore before it's too late and you have to run home. I have a bit of a lag issue; sometimes it feels like my hobbit is drunk and trying to make it into the house but misses the door! 

I think this is a very ""cozy"" game with the emphasis on socialization and hobbit life. The humor is very charming and true to what I imagine a typical hobbit life would be like. It isn't (thankfully) for those who's idea of gaming is all about carrying around a big weapon and killing stuff!","Post: What do you like and dislike about Tales of the Shire?

I love the birds for navigation and the butterflies leading you to foraging spots. I know it's been a bit hit-and-miss with people, but I actually love the artwork. I think it's charming and fits the tone. I love that crops and plants for foraging change according to season. I really like the cooking mechanics; they present a bit of challenge but aren't frustrating. I also really like the companion planting for gardening. I feel like there's quite a lot of content and incentive to level up relationships with the other hobbits; I'm almost six hours in and still haven't unlocked any other rooms in my house, or parts of my garden, and I'm just getting started with the clubs.


Cons: I do think the days could be a bit longer. I like foraging, but when I've been running round for a bit grabbing mushrooms it's suddenly evening and I still have things I want to buy. I do like that it stops during certain activities, but still feel I don't have quite enough time in the day. I also feel like no co-op was a missed opportunity.

It's a light-hearted, cheery little game with playful music, adorable little hobbit characters, and pretty scenery. Yes, it is a lot more cartoon-y than a lot of games, but I think it adds to the whole vibe of the game itself.

In terms of glitches, I have not run into any quite yet. It seems to run fairly well on my Acer Nitro 5. I intend to also download the game on my steam deck for some more relaxed gameplay.

1. Actually being able to pet the animals, maybe feed them.

3. Cooking for myself, serving it for myself, eating it myself.

4. Being able to close my door, when it rains etc I'd like to be able to be cozy in my house and close the door.. I don't know if that changes later when I unlock the main door but right now the back door is always open.

5. I wish I was able to swim, right now you can't even enter the water at all.

Hullo Hobbits,

A heartfelt thank you for your helpful bug reports, your feedback is making a real difference as we prepare patches.

Worry not, we've been out in the garden with our gloves on. Here are a few bugs we've been busy tending to:

🍄‍🟫  **Foraging**
In later years, some players have found forageables increasingly scarce. Bywater's fields and forests should be full of treasures, so we're rolling up our sleeves to bring back this bounty.

🦋  **Butterfly Cups**
We know some of you are having trouble finding Butterfly Cups, which makes it tricky to satisfy certain cravings and build those all-important bonds with your neighbours.

🏡  **Waking Up Under Your House**
A Hobbit home is all about comfort, and it's certainly not comforting finding yourself underneath those nicely tiled floors of yours.

We hope this brings a bit of comfort, and appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to tend to The Shire. Know that there are other fixes we're working on too, and we'll share updates when patches are ready. &lt;:heart:1261116342526939167&gt;

Adding a quick note to this:

I don't work for Weta, I'm just a regular person, like you, who loves this game and LOTR stuff. 

If you're having issues with the game, a bug that hasn't been addressed, yet, please send bug reports to shirehelp@wetaworkshop.co.nz

It is so cute and all the Easter eggs and little LotR facts popping up are so fun! It is a very well-detailed game, and I’m super pleased with it!

I have run into no glitches until now. I was just playing, I think I’m on day 9 of fall, and I had invited 4 characters to a shared meal at the Green Dragon. They all mailed me back in the morning and I cooked up a bunch of dishes and headed to the Green Dragon for elevensies. When I got there, a scene triggered for another tale, and when I got out of the scene I ran a couple quick errands for Orlo, heading back to the Green Dragon afterwards. But now the game won’t prompt the option to start the shared meal! :0 It doesn’t appear on the map either, like it didn’t exist. But the letters are still in the mail, I just can’t actually begin the meal. If I go to bed, will the characters be mad at me for leaving them hanging?

I already invited them to a new shared meal at the three-farthing stone for tomorrow, so hopefully all will work out still!",24,24,"Post: Game cancelled my shared meal, I think ?

— 

Overall, after several hours of play (ps5), I feel like I’m having a lovely, low-stakes experience of living a little hobbit life — the one Frodo would have known and wanted to protect when he went off with the ring. The one he couldn’t truly return to after all he had been through. From that perspective, it’s a lovely gift for a fan :) 

I think this is worth the buy if you’re a lotr fan, and definitely worth the buy if you like cozy games or related life-sim stuff. Just go in knowing it’s the life sim of an average hobbit in the shire, not one of the two-to-five-total hobbits who left to fight dragons or destroy the soul of evil. 

Really, I can’t think of any fictional group better suited to the cozy game genre than hobbits. Their entire existence is silly low-stakes village drama, cheeky little personalities, a love of nature, home, food, crafting, and staying close to your hobbit hole. 

Things I think they did very well outside of the hobbit-y-ness:

1. They got the right details right. I think the physics, lighting, subtle changes in season and flora and fauna that appear, different fish being around at different times of day or different seasons, or certain plants growing better together is all thoughtful cozy game heaven. It’s the right effort in the right places so that even the “cartoony” style fades away into something that feels immersive.

2. Things take “just-enough” work. Fishing takes a little effort, but it’s fun and relatively fast. I’m not sitting waiting 3 minutes do a single dish to bite. You aren’t given nor do you have to make insane amounts of money to decorate your house — you get a little starter set of clothes and a little starter set of home decor options so it actually feels homey, but there’s still incentive to grow.

3. The main metric of forwarding the game is building relationships through hosting meals and I love it. The cooking is probably the most complex thing (in a fun way), but that makes sense for its level of importance in the game.  

4. I feel like a hobbit and this feels like my village. The village is but enough to need some way finding (the birds are cute), but after a while it is small enough that you start to know you way around a bit without being bored — the same way you’d know your way around your own home town. 

5. Most importantly, Weta and crew protected the hobbits. There is (so far) not rings of power horror. The writing, characters, motivations etc. all feel true to a Tolkien-PJ Films idea of a hobbit. Cartoony graphics do not take me out of the world, but a hobbit not being hobbit-y would. Even the dwarf is charming in a dwarf way that made me chuckle and generally every little subtle call-out has made me smile. The hobbits as a whole are really a bit of a caricature of the small idealistic English village inhabitants — so the exaggerated visuals of the game kind of fit for me.

Anyway, happy hobbit-ing :)

5. Most importantly, Weta and crew protected the hobbits. There is (so far) not rings of power horror. The writing, characters, motivations etc. all feel true to a Tolkien-PJ Films idea of a hobbit. Cartoony graphics do not take me out of the world, but a hobbit not being hobbit-y would. Even the dwarf is charming in a dwarf way that made me chuckle and generally every little subtle call-out has made me smile. The hobbits as a whole are really a bit of a caricature of the small idealistic English village inhabitants — so the exaggerated visuals of the game kind of fit for me.

Anyway, happy hobbit-ing :)

Like, when a Gamgee or a took is mentioned, I'm like 'Hey, I know your cousin!'",9,2025-07-30 16:49:51+00:00,Reviewers expecting Frodo or Bilbo experience surprised when hobbit cozy game is about the other 99.9% of hobbits.,"tl;dr: This game has been a lovely, surprising gift to me as a lotr fan and I wanted to write this so others who might have been scared off give it a chance if they appreciate the same things I do.

— 

Overall, after several hours of play (ps5), I feel like I’m having a lovely, low-stakes experience of living a little hobbit life — the one Frodo would have known and wanted to protect when he went off with the ring. The one he couldn’t truly return to after all he had been through. From that perspective, it’s a lovely gift for a fan :) 

I think this is worth the buy if you’re a lotr fan, and definitely worth the buy if you like cozy games or related life-sim stuff. Just go in knowing it’s the life sim of an average hobbit in the shire, not one of the two-to-five-total hobbits who left to fight dragons or destroy the soul of evil. 

Really, I can’t think of any fictional group better suited to the cozy game genre than hobbits. Their entire existence is silly low-stakes village drama, cheeky little personalities, a love of nature, home, food, crafting, and staying close to your hobbit hole. 

Things I think they did very well outside of the hobbit-y-ness:

1. They got the right details right. I think the physics, lighting, subtle changes in season and flora and fauna that appear, different fish being around at different times of day or different seasons, or certain plants growing better together is all thoughtful cozy game heaven. It’s the right effort in the right places so that even the “cartoony” style fades away into something that feels immersive.

2. Things take “just-enough” work. Fishing takes a little effort, but it’s fun and relatively fast. I’m not sitting waiting 3 minutes do a single dish to bite. You aren’t given nor do you have to make insane amounts of money to decorate your house — you get a little starter set of clothes and a little starter set of home decor options so it actually feels homey, but there’s still incentive to grow.

3. The main metric of forwarding the game is building relationships through hosting meals and I love it. The cooking is probably the most complex thing (in a fun way), but that makes sense for its level of importance in the game.  

4. I feel like a hobbit and this feels like my village. The village is but enough to need some way finding (the birds are cute), but after a while it is small enough that you start to know you way around a bit without being bored — the same way you’d know your way around your own home town.

I'm at a point in the game where I'm able to serve only 3 stars+ meals to my guests if I wish to do so, so I'd like to sell all the other meals I had prepared that are lower to that rank and take some space slots in my pantry but when I put them in my bag and try to sell them (to anyone), my cursor just gets blocked and I can't even select them (I'm playing on the Switch).

Is that normal (as in we can't sell prepared meals) or is it a glitch?

I have been living and breathing this game since it came out, and with over 20 years of life sim / cozy game experience under my belt, I pretty much blitzed through the main storyline. Now that I'm in the epilogue, I've realized there are definitely a few things I wish I'd prioritized earlier. So, I thought I'd share some tips in case they help anyone else enjoy their time in the Shire a bit more!

  
First off, meals. As a bit of a perfectionist, I was determined to serve my guests the best meals. I would only host every few days so I could source every ingredient and get it just right. Looking back, it would have been better to host a meal every day. So much in this game is locked behind friendship rather than storyline. Plus, it's cute and cozy. So, don't stress about perfection, just invite folks over. Hobbits never turn down a meal!

  
Secondly, hoarding ingredients. I am a (virtual) hoarder. My hobbit's pantry is not full, but gosh, do I have tons of food. And not a lot of money. Or furniture or gardening plots. If I'd sold more forageables, fish, and crops instead of clinging to them, I could've had more garden plots, more furniture, and more access to higher-quality ingredients. It felt pretty lame to finish the main story while still using only the garden plots I started with and the couple I was gifted. That's my own fault, but take my advice and sell your stuff! You'll be able to do more, faster. 

  
Third, clubs. Clubs don't become available until partway through the story, but once they do, they're SO important. Not only do they unlock major upgrades that make life in the Shire smoother, but completing club tasks also builds friendship with club leaders. They're your key to unlocking better tools and a more fleshed-out game loop. Don't ignore them! 

  
Overall, the main storyline is cute and fun, but it isn't the heart of the game. The point is the vibe, the community. Tales of the Shire shines when you take your time and just live like a hobbit. So, take it from a speedgamer: slow down and let yourself marinate in the world. Host meals, even if they're simple. Decorate your space. Garden just because it's pleasant. Enjoy your neighbors. After all, hobbits are never in a hurry.

So, take it from a speedgamer: slow down and let yourself marinate in the world. Host meals, even if they're simple. Decorate your space. Garden just because it's pleasant. Enjoy your neighbors. After all, hobbits are never in a hurry.

This game is a little bit buggy. It doesn't really bother me, because I tolerate (and enjoy) Bugthesda's masterpiece Skyrim on a daily basis, but I'm fully expecting this subreddit to soon have some funny glitch clips. Just saying.  
Also--no, I've never had NPCs wandering through my house, but maybe you didn't give them enough time to leave before going to bed?",3,2025-08-05 19:58:23+00:00,Why do I keep finding hobbits wandering out of my home at odd hours?,"Last night (in real life), just before I logged off for the night in TotS I invited Willow and Daisy over for a shared meal. It was a bit earlier in the in-game day than I intended, so it was afternoon tea, with time afterwards to do foraging etc. I let the meal cut scene play then saved the game and quit with them both still in the house. This morning I've logged in and there they are, right where I saved the game, and they wandered off to go home.

So I go about my hobbit-y business finishing the in-game day. My hobbit went to sleep. Overnight, creepy footsteps played in the mini-night cut scene, and on waking I found Willow Took in my house. She wandered out the back door (only one I have open so far) and went home.

At the end of the in-game day, I go home late at night to find Daisy Took in my home. She stares at my hobbit as she walks past and, I hope, off to go home and sleep.

Wha? Has anyone else had NPCs wandering through their home at non-meal times?

The only thing I can think is maybe it's a bug? I don't have time to play more now, but any ideas on how to solve this?

I'm gonna take these to heart, already loving the simple hobbit life ❤️ positively enjoying being a busy hobbit worried about inviting over and feeding the neighbors and making my house the most presentable and hopefully outdoing those other hobbits.",3,2025-08-01 16:24:48+00:00,Tips on pacing and priorities from someone who finished the main storyline.,"Hey everyone! I have been living and breathing this game since it came out, and with over 20 years of life sim / cozy game experience under my belt, I pretty much blitzed through the main storyline. Now that I'm in the epilogue, I've realized there are definitely a few things I wish I'd prioritized earlier. So, I thought I'd share some tips in case they help anyone else enjoy their time in the Shire a bit more!

  
First off, meals. As a bit of a perfectionist, I was determined to serve my guests the best meals. I would only host every few days so I could source every ingredient and get it just right. Looking back, it would have been better to host a meal every day. So much in this game is locked behind friendship rather than storyline. Plus, it's cute and cozy. So, don't stress about perfection, just invite folks over. Hobbits never turn down a meal!

  
Secondly, hoarding ingredients. I am a (virtual) hoarder. My hobbit's pantry is not full, but gosh, do I have tons of food. And not a lot of money. Or furniture or gardening plots. If I'd sold more forageables, fish, and crops instead of clinging to them, I could've had more garden plots, more furniture, and more access to higher-quality ingredients. It felt pretty lame to finish the main story while still using only the garden plots I started with and the couple I was gifted. That's my own fault, but take my advice and sell your stuff! You'll be able to do more, faster. 

  
Third, clubs. Clubs don't become available until partway through the story, but once they do, they're SO important. Not only do they unlock major upgrades that make life in the Shire smoother, but completing club tasks also builds friendship with club leaders. They're your key to unlocking better tools and a more fleshed-out game loop. Don't ignore them!

I’m only an hour or so into it but I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played so far.,4 stars,0.39814600348472595,"[{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.3099566698074341}, {'label': 'excitement', 'score': 0.2305956780910492}, {'label': 'curiosity', 'score': 0.1551232635974884}]",6.8,joy

Hullo! 

I love your game, it's something special. I love the details, and enjoy foraging, gardening and cooking dishes for my hobbit friends. 

I'm playing on Switch and my 43 hours in the game have vanished. You're well aware, as Reddit has widely discussed this issue and many are reaching out with this and other issues they are experiencing on the Switch. 

You've been busy with the patch for PC, which looked extensive on your website. Maybe now you're working on a patch for PlayStation users? I don't know. 

I'm hoping for some news regarding the lost save files bug on Switch. I can't bear to raise my Hobbit Peony Greenhand from the abyss, so I've started a new game playing as Filibert Gardner, but I won't get too attached.... 

Please communicate with us about any upcoming patches. I'd like to feel safe building my house and garden knowing that they won't disappear. 

Thanks,

— 

Overall, after several hours of play (ps5), I feel like I’m having a lovely, low-stakes experience of living a little hobbit life — the one Frodo would have known and wanted to protect when he went off with the ring. The one he couldn’t truly return to after all he had been through. From that perspective, it’s a lovely gift for a fan :) 

I think this is worth the buy if you’re a lotr fan, and definitely worth the buy if you like cozy games or related life-sim stuff. Just go in knowing it’s the life sim of an average hobbit in the shire, not one of the two-to-five-total hobbits who left to fight dragons or destroy the soul of evil. 

Really, I can’t think of any fictional group better suited to the cozy game genre than hobbits. Their entire existence is silly low-stakes village drama, cheeky little personalities, a love of nature, home, food, crafting, and staying close to your hobbit hole. 

Things I think they did very well outside of the hobbit-y-ness:

1. They got the right details right. I think the physics, lighting, subtle changes in season and flora and fauna that appear, different fish being around at different times of day or different seasons, or certain plants growing better together is all thoughtful cozy game heaven. It’s the right effort in the right places so that even the “cartoony” style fades away into something that feels immersive.

2. Things take “just-enough” work. Fishing takes a little effort, but it’s fun and relatively fast. I’m not sitting waiting 3 minutes do a single dish to bite. You aren’t given nor do you have to make insane amounts of money to decorate your house — you get a little starter set of clothes and a little starter set of home decor options so it actually feels homey, but there’s still incentive to grow.

3. The main metric of forwarding the game is building relationships through hosting meals and I love it. The cooking is probably the most complex thing (in a fun way), but that makes sense for its level of importance in the game.  

4. I feel like a hobbit and this feels like my village. The village is but enough to need some way finding (the birds are cute), but after a while it is small enough that you start to know you way around a bit without being bored — the same way you’d know your way around your own home town. 

5. Most importantly, Weta and crew protected the hobbits. There is (so far) not rings of power horror. The writing, characters, motivations etc. all feel true to a Tolkien-PJ Films idea of a hobbit. Cartoony graphics do not take me out of the world, but a hobbit not being hobbit-y would. Even the dwarf is charming in a dwarf way that made me chuckle and generally every little subtle call-out has made me smile. The hobbits as a whole are really a bit of a caricature of the small idealistic English village inhabitants — so the exaggerated visuals of the game kind of fit for me.

Anyway, happy hobbit-ing :)

i was in a pretty dark place in my life playing lord of the rings online, 13+ years ago and remember loving the shire starter area. i completed it (the shire) over and over and remember saying i just want a game like this, like whats that postmans life about? sod the ring (the game overall wasnt the best) i just want to live the life of a chill hobbit. so pretty much dream come true lol.

i made the mistake of watching reviews whilst it was downloading and thought i have made a mistake, but to be honest i absolutely love it. never played cozy games before so all the mechanincs are pretty new to me. i love zoning out to boring grinds and the small map isnt stressful or overwhelming. plays true to hobbits not liking to wander too far from home tbh lol.

made up i found this sub and can see other people appreciating it for what it is. i was a little gutted when i saw how better the graphics are on the pc, i have a pc but the mobile nature of the switch means i will play it alot more than that version.

6 hours in and taking it slow. i hope it gets the patches it has been promised and deserves but i feel i have tens of hours worth of game time before they bother me.

i have found some of the dialogue genuinely made me lol.

one thing though if anyone can help? i have totally ran out of money, i have a pantry full of bits to sell but non of the village folk seem to offer to buy them from me? i have tried taking fish veg and meals.

sorry for the lack of pics i am on switch but when i have a hobbit hole to be proud of i will figure a way to get them off the device.

doubt it will happen but some sort of multiplayer, visiting others hobbit holes etc would be a dream.

just about to head into autumn, cant wait to see the seasons change.

Hullo Hobbits,

We’ve been out with our trowels and watering cans, and are delighted to let you know that we've rolled out a new hotfix patch today for PC to address several issues:

🍄‍🟫  **Foraging**
We’ve made some changes to ensure forageables stay plentiful (and your pantry well-stocked) as the years go by.

🦋  **Butterfly Cups**
Those elusive Butterfly Cups should now be easier to find, and you can put together that perfect feast.

🥕  **Pantry**
We've taken our tools to the kitchen, fixing a bug that was keeping some Hobbits from seeing the full list of their pantry with a controller. Everything's back in order, from top shelf to bottom basket.

🍽️  **Shared Meals**
We've polished up the shared meal location selector, so you can set the table wherever your Hobbit heart desires when using your mouse.

We want to reassure you that the under-the-floor issue is very much a focus for us, it’s just taking a bit more time to get right.

You can find the full patch notes in &lt;#1402478903225745490&gt; 

Thank you, dear friends! &lt;:ladle:1261119231194300448&gt;

But yeah, how DOES it works? I'm talking about the flavors. Sometime I'm cooking dishes with ""uncertain flavor"" by default but depending on the ingredient they'll get certain flavors but I'm unable to really understand which ingredient will be the defining flavor...

For example:

I tried cooking a **Cool Taters and Beans**.  
I used Maize (**sweet**), Beans (**bitter**), Brown Onion (**spicy**) and Brown Tater (**sweet**). I thought that because there was 2 ingredients marked as sweet, the plate would be sweet... So I decided to use the frying pan on the Brown Tater to make them salty since that's the flavor I needed. 

The dish ended up being **Spicy** for some reason???

is there a way to know and control what flavor the dish will have, other than using ONLY ingredient of that one flavor?? Is there a certain order to follow? What Am I not getting exactly?

The day Tales of the Shire released on Switch, July 29th 2025, I bought it. Or rather, I had pre-ordered the physical version but it wouldn’t be out for another week so I cancelled that order and bought the digital version on the Nintendo store.

Anyway, despite minor bugs here and there, I really enjoyed it and played it nearly every day. My last day playing it was August 25th in the evening. I docked my switch, went to bed. I worked all day yesterday but due to my law enforcement schedule I have today off.

Got up bright and early to play the game. When I went into the game it froze on the main screen and would not let me exit the game.
I turned off the screen, turned it on and it let me exit the game. When went back into the game to informed me that the game now has an autosave feature, which I was excited for.

But then the main menu opened up and I could only start a new game, all my save data was gone. I contacted Nintendo and they did all of their trouble shooting and informed me the issue was no on their end and to contacts the TOTS Support. I went to their website and there’s no number, only an email.

I’ve emailed them. But has anyone else had this issue?

I'm finally in my first autumn and the warm hazy lighting over everything is so lovely ahhh!!! I'm a seasoned cosy gamer and tween Hobbit (and admittedly didn't have the highest of hopes for this game) but it's really surprised me in the bestest of ways. The art style looked questionable in the trailers but it's so beautiful in game. I've genuinely never felt such cosiness in every corner of a game, especially while in autumn rn, I don't want it to end 🍂 

Does anyone know if there's been any hints or news about updates/DLCs? It has so much potential and even mentions that we could visit other places when we find the Three-Farthing Stone. I'm wondering if there's something brewing in the background depending on audience response! 

Anyway thanks for reading my ramble, back to foraging 🍄🫶",30,4,"Post: The cosy warm haze of autumn 🍂🌻🥹 - any news for updates?

I’ve been very busy since I last shared progress on my Tales of the Shire companion app, [The Burrow Book](http://theburrowbook.com). I’m excited to show you all the new things I’ve added!

Here’s what’s new since last time:

* **Fish Tracking**: A handy check mark for every fish species you’ve caught. You’ll always know what’s left to reel in and when to find it.
* **Clothing + Tracking**: Window shop and keep track of all the outfits and accessories you’ve collected along the way.
* **Cooking**: View every meal with its recipe, required ingredients, and character cravings. You can also track which dishes you’ve cooked to work toward that final achievement! (It was my last one to 100% btw)
* **Furniture**: Browse every furniture piece, including shop items and those received as gifts after sharing meals. (The gift section is mostly complete, but I’d love help filling in the missing pieces.)
* **Characters**: See every character’s trading details, recipe unlocks by relationship rank, and seasonal meal cravings all in one handy place. It’s a little book… of all their little faces.

A note about tracking: Everything is stored locally in your browser. No logins, no ads, no data collection. Just cozy Hobbit magic.

A note about me: I’ve spent over 128+ hours playing Tales of the Shire on my Steam Deck as I recover from surgery. (It’s going...not great, please send healing vibes!) What started as a simple way for me to check planting companions, foraging seasons, and fishing info has grown into so much more than I expected. I hope it makes your own adventures a little easier too.

If you’d like to take a peek, share feedback, or just want a no-nonsense game companion, you can visit [theburrowbook.com](http://theburrowbook.com).

good to know i love the fishing mechanics",6,2025-08-07 15:13:56+00:00,Made for me.,"i saw this game on an advert and downloaded on switch 2 instantly.

i was in a pretty dark place in my life playing lord of the rings online, 13+ years ago and remember loving the shire starter area. i completed it (the shire) over and over and remember saying i just want a game like this, like whats that postmans life about? sod the ring (the game overall wasnt the best) i just want to live the life of a chill hobbit. so pretty much dream come true lol.

i made the mistake of watching reviews whilst it was downloading and thought i have made a mistake, but to be honest i absolutely love it. never played cozy games before so all the mechanincs are pretty new to me. i love zoning out to boring grinds and the small map isnt stressful or overwhelming. plays true to hobbits not liking to wander too far from home tbh lol.

made up i found this sub and can see other people appreciating it for what it is. i was a little gutted when i saw how better the graphics are on the pc, i have a pc but the mobile nature of the switch means i will play it alot more than that version.

6 hours in and taking it slow. i hope it gets the patches it has been promised and deserves but i feel i have tens of hours worth of game time before they bother me.

i have found some of the dialogue genuinely made me lol.

one thing though if anyone can help? i have totally ran out of money, i have a pantry full of bits to sell but non of the village folk seem to offer to buy them from me? i have tried taking fish veg and meals.

sorry for the lack of pics i am on switch but when i have a hobbit hole to be proud of i will figure a way to get them off the device.

doubt it will happen but some sort of multiplayer, visiting others hobbit holes etc would be a dream.

just about to head into autumn, cant wait to see the seasons change.

This guide is based on the exact combinations I used for different bed types, AND IS BASED ON PLANTING 5 TO 14 PLANTS PER BED. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THIS EXACT WITH MAXIMIZING SPACING, CONTINUE TO USE THE ORIGINAL GUIDE.

ETA: I have conducted more testing with control plots vs different variations. Putting 3 flowers per 1 crop is the easiest way to get higher star crops without thinking about it. The highest chance I've found for 3 stars is to plant two different flowers with two companion crops. This still does NOT guarantee 3 stars. The game can still give you a 1 star even with all happy companion plants.

Hii hi! Yesterday I made a companion crop guide and a crop chart. It does have what I've found to be the most successful crop companion combinations for each season.

I was seriously hoping someone would put a guide like this together! would love to see your garden too!❤️,6,2025-09-26 16:35:42+00:00,Companion Crop Guide,"ETA 2: I’ve started a 2nd document guide for companion planting. This guide is based on the exact combinations I used for different bed types, AND IS BASED ON PLANTING 5 TO 14 PLANTS PER BED. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THIS EXACT WITH MAXIMIZING SPACING, CONTINUE TO USE THE ORIGINAL GUIDE.

ETA: I have conducted more testing with control plots vs different variations. Putting 3 flowers per 1 crop is the easiest way to get higher star crops without thinking about it. The highest chance I've found for 3 stars is to plant two different flowers with two companion crops. This still does NOT guarantee 3 stars. The game can still give you a 1 star even with all happy companion plants.

Hii hi! Yesterday I made a companion crop guide and a crop chart. It does have what I've found to be the most successful crop companion combinations for each season. However, it was a lot of cross referencing and it may not be perfect, so if you have suggestions, feel free to let me know. I made it mostly for me, but figured I'd share it in case it helped anybody else. It's public on my google docs.

I highlighted the important parts for the companion planting charts, so you can skip the tips in between if you want.

**Hello!** I recently did a [review ](https://youtu.be/n2JVXGe0944)of this game on my channel, and to be honest, I love it! Many said they don't, which is ok, preference is key. The art style is appealing, there is plenty to do, and though slow-moving at first, the game does have its fun moments. After playing it for a few hours, though, I could start to see a lot of the problematic game mechanics, or lack there-of. *I got my game for free, but this does not change my outlook.* Here is my quick review:

***PROS***

* Game is appealing on PC and mostly console.
*  Easy to understand, good for all ages.
* Style of game and noises make my brain happy.
* Not too many NPCs or too many places.
* You can say hi to animals!
*  Gardening is fun and interactable, and cooking is too.
*  I like the relationship system, but it is too easy.

***CONS***

* Not multiplayer. I know it's singleplayer, and was designed that way, but it was always advertised as ""play with friends"". They were implying the NPCs would become friends, I suppose.
* Minimap would be useful, the map is confusing to just keep pressing M.
* Nintendo Switch gameplay is a fever dream, it'll make you nauseous.
* Relationship system is too easy, I wish there were more things to do with NPCs like gift them items or more quests.
* Gameplay is very limited. The game itself has a good 6-8 hours of gameplay tops before it's just repetitive.
* Cooking is pressing buttons, I wish there was more to do!
* The game itself is very child-friendly, which I get it - They want ALL ages to understand and enjoy, but it feels like a tap to play game for the most part. I don't want war and fighting, I just want thorough and lore-filled!
* Hearing ""Lord of the Rings"" and then seeing a game that embodies the shire but doesn't through and through exemplify it is painful for my fangirl heart.
* Petting animals is lovely, but no owning them? No farming? It sucks to only see them in passing, and you can't even pet them.

***CONCLUSION***

I grew up watching LOTR, The Hobbit, and I have many collectibles and yapping hours on the topics. Does this make my opinion highest? No, not at all, but *I do wish the game brought The Shire and Hobbits to life more*. Hair on the feet and enjoying meals weren't the only things that made life so serene in that place. Having animals, interactable cooking, frolicking with friends - I just wish there was more. I am happy to see so many liked it and I did enjoy playing it!

Being an easy game is perfect for me, I just found that the quest where being completed too fast sometimes due to proximity on the map. I really like easy, I hate to be stuck on a quest, but I also love when I have to take time to accomplish a quest. Walking in the woods to find mushroom, without them being 2m from each other... But I understand this is the way the game is made. I will look foward to a bit more difficulty in the club quest.

Thank you :)",6,2025-09-23 14:57:03+00:00,Difficulty level of the game,"Hi! 

I just bought the game and played around 5h and I was wondering if the game gets a little more challenging in the future? I really love easy cosy games (my fave right now is Palia), but I'm finding no challenge in the game right now... Everything is so easy to find and answers to a lot of quest are so close by that it takes less than 5 minutes to complete. 

I love the vibe and all, I am a  Hobbit at heart, but I was wondering, for those who have been playing for a while, does it get a bit more challenging?

But I couldn't stop watching other people playing and thought I'd buy it on Steam and if it was as bad as everyone was saying it was, I'd get a refund. 

Oh boy, am I glad I decided to try it for myself. I'm in love with it. Is it perfect? No, of course not. There are some things I wish we could do, such as going inside the other Hobbits' houses. Are there NPCs you can't interact with? Yes. But that's not a deal-breaker for me. I'm having so much fun gardening and hosting dinner parties (and breakfast parties, and afternoon teas) that I don't care about those other NPCs. And for what it's worth, they aren't exactly lifeless. They will have thoughts that appear above their heads and I always slow down to read them because sometimes they're interesting or informative. Voice acting is another issue that I don't care about. It doesn't bother me at all that I have to read the dialogue. You may feel differently, I don't know. The dialogue is cute and sometimes spicy and I love that. 

I have thousands of hours in games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. I've played Fae Farm, Dinkum, My Time at Sandrock, a few Story of Seasons titles and probably a dozen other life sims/farming RPGs that I can't even remember the names of because I almost always end up bored with them. But this game is turning out to be one of my favorites. I'm not usually too invested in the friendship mechanics of games and focus more on the money making/farming/upgrading aspects. But this game has me invested. When I'm cooking for my guests, I actually fuss over the meals I'm cooking. I go through my ingredients and seasonings to make sure I have just the right ones. But the best part is that even if I don't have exactly what they're craving, they'll still get friendship points and level up. 

Also, I'm living out my fantasy of living in a Hobbit hole! Are you freaking kidding me? I've only unlocked the first house upgrade but oh my god, the amount of space and customization is amazing. Sometimes I just run through all my rooms because it makes me happy. I can't wait to unlock everything. 

As far as what I'm playing it on, I'm playing on a PC but it's not a great PC. I have the graphics set to medium and I still think it's a beautiful game. I have a better PC that's just not set up right now and I can't wait to play it on that when I'm able to, so I can see the graphics on the highest settings. 

I sincerely hope the developers continue to support the game for at least the near future but even if they don't, I can still see myself playing this one for a good long while.

After hosting many dinner parties, I am sure people have started finding out who they like to have together. Personally I have a set system for leveling friendship and not leaving anyone out but I still have some favorite get togethers.

But that's me ""optimizing"" to ensure I get max friendship. Here's who I like to pair together for funsies:

Farmer Cotton and Sandyman. Those two are going to learn to play nice dammit!

Young Tom, Nefi, and Orlo. Not gonna lie I really liked Nefi and Young Tom's interactions and think they would be cute together, and in order for it to not be awkward I invite Orlo as my ""date.""

While doing so, I noticed that the articles were listed as coming from a ""Non-Canon"" source...

My gods, do I *dislike* that. 

I really think the Fanbase (and other fanbases in general) really needs to get away with worrying *so much* about canon. In the ""Lord of the Rings"" Canon, Tolkien intended for the books to be an imperfect source. They are - as written - Tolkien's translations of the Red Book of Westmarch, which in turn is the writings and stories of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, with additions by Samwise Gamgee. The Appendices? Bilbo's *best guess* at trying to reconcile the histories of Men, Hobbits, Dwarves and Elves, as well as the *Mythology* of the Silmarillion, into a cohesive whole. 

Maybe it was all just a *little* inaccurate.

So who cares if Tales of the Shire is separate from the stories that were written down? Who's to say that it's ""Non-Canonical"" and chuck it in the ""Spin-off"" bin of second-rate stories? It's fun, it's cute, it's so very *Hobbitish* (lacking, though, in ales and pipeweed). So long as it's not rewriting major moments (e.g. our Hobbit coming across a sinister golden Ring, or riders cloaked all in black coming to Bywater) it really should be any sort of hang-up or issue enough to be denoted as ""Non-Canon"". It just throws a poor light on it all, says I.

My gods, do I *dislike* that. 

I really think the Fanbase (and other fanbases in general) really needs to get away with worrying *so much* about canon. In the ""Lord of the Rings"" Canon, Tolkien intended for the books to be an imperfect source. They are - as written - Tolkien's translations of the Red Book of Westmarch, which in turn is the writings and stories of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, with additions by Samwise Gamgee. The Appendices? Bilbo's *best guess* at trying to reconcile the histories of Men, Hobbits, Dwarves and Elves, as well as the *Mythology* of the Silmarillion, into a cohesive whole. 

Maybe it was all just a *little* inaccurate.

Hullo Hobbits,

We’ve been out with our trowels and watering cans, and are delighted to let you know that we've rolled out a new hotfix patch today for PC to address several issues:

🍄‍🟫  **Foraging**
We’ve made some changes to ensure forageables stay plentiful (and your pantry well-stocked) as the years go by.

🦋  **Butterfly Cups**
Those elusive Butterfly Cups should now be easier to find, and you can put together that perfect feast.

🥕  **Pantry**
We've taken our tools to the kitchen, fixing a bug that was keeping some Hobbits from seeing the full list of their pantry with a controller. Everything's back in order, from top shelf to bottom basket.

🍽️  **Shared Meals**
We've polished up the shared meal location selector, so you can set the table wherever your Hobbit heart desires when using your mouse.

We want to reassure you that the under-the-floor issue is very much a focus for us, it’s just taking a bit more time to get right.

You can find the full patch notes in &lt;#1402478903225745490&gt; 

Thank you, dear friends! &lt;:ladle:1261119231194300448&gt;

Some of critiques I get, like the art style or the bugs. But some of the reviews make zero sense and it just seems like the game is getting bombed because the reviews don't know what they're doing. One person complained they had to stop playing when they were tasked with Nefi's hammer because they couldn't find the hammer and the birds only led you to Nefi and she couldn't be bothered to hunt all over the Shire for the hammer. Um...the birds are leading you to Nefi because that's ALSO WHERE THE HAMMER IS. Nefi tells you EXACTLY where the hammer is. I guess the birds could have been a little more obvious but the game shouldn't have to hold your hand every step of the way. Another reviewer liked the mechanic of using the birds to show your path but they don't point which direction you should be going and they don't tell you if you made a wrong turn. Both statements are completely wrong.

TOTS has its faults that are worth bringing up but it just feels like a lot of reviewers are playing for about thirty seconds and complaining things they just didn't understand.",111,40,"Post: Why do some reviewers act like they didn't even play the game?

But I really feel on all levels that the game wasn't released in the state the developers intended and that too many things are missing to make it a ""complete"" game in my eyes.



I would really like some communication from the developers at Weta to show their long-term interest in the game.



What I would really like:



\- A technique to review on consoles. On PS5 or Xbox, the game should be able to run perfectly at 40 or 60 fps. It struggles to maintain 30 on PS5...

\- Interactions with the scenery and objects. It's unfair to have such a beautiful sofa and not be able to sit on it, to have a hot cup of tea and not be able to drink it...

\- Random and seasonal events. Something to bring a little life to this charming village. It's crazy to create such a place and leave it lifeless outside of story quests!

\- Romance? I know some people see little point in that. Yet, many games of this genre offer that, and it adds a little more life and interaction to the world and the game!

\- More outfits!

\- More dialogue with NPCs, outside of quests! It's so quiet outside of story quests...

\- Visiting other residents' houses and being invited into their homes. Why does my dear hobbit avatar always have to do all the work???

\- Many other ideas (organizing parties, having a pet, customizing furniture and objects, etc.) that could further flesh out the game. But already, the ideas above would make it much more substantial and make it feel like a truly finished game.

For context, you learn about the King's Great Joy when &gt;!You reach friendship level 3 with Nefi.!&lt; You learn a cool dwarf story from Nefi that I will share below:

  
""I will tell you the story of the King's Great Joy. Many years ago, before the hobbits came, this land was nothing but ruins and grass. There was a king. He fought many battles for his people. But the kingdom was small and his people were few. The road here was built by the dwarves. From our home in the blue mountains to the halls of Kazedum.



My people protected the bridge and kept the road free. Friendship was great between the king and the dwarves. My people crafted a mighty gift for the king's great joy. Perhaps it was a great weapon to defend the king's land. a sword to cleave his enemies or a helm that no blade could break. But what it was is long forgotten. The dwarves buried this great gift to return in peace and take it back. They never returned.



The king's great joy lies under these fields where now hobbits grow food.""

Reading this, I can't help but wonder if the reason Nefi decided to become a blacksmith in Bywater is because she is hoping to uncover the King's Great Joy herself.  Was the King in question the first king of Arnor, Elendil himself? But he didn't rule over a ""small"" kingdom. Perhaps Amlaith, first king of Arthedain? 

Maybe even some forgotten human tribal chieftain of the men living around Evendim, before the third age? After all, the Dwarven Road is older than Arnor, or even Lindon.

I like to immediately water my garden and harvest anything. Replant and dump anything into the pantry. 

Then its off to Ruby's pond for fish. Stop at Farmer Cotton to sell fish and buy seeds. Pop over to Ladle's Jetty for more fish. Keep the good ones and sell the rest. Stop over to Young Tom or Sandyman if I'm low on supplies. 

Its usually mid-day by now, so I either run home to have a meal or go foraging on the NW side of the map. 

If I'm going home, I will check the gardens and drop off foraging/inventory. Maybe check the cravings of my guests to make sure I have something that works for them. Cook a few dishes for inventory.

By cranberry swamp (night)

Ladles Jetty

On top of lookout hill tower

Stone bridge

Three farthing stone

Tree root by forest pond

The one on top of willows house (night)

The one by the green dragon (are there two?)

One by the stump in the cotton farm fishing pond

At the back of burrow twins shop

I think there was one up the stairs behind the ivy in?

And now that Gardening Club is like level 4.75 and my friendship with Willow is 9.5, I decided to try to put a couple of things around.

  
I've put a few things up, put them back in storage, put other things up.

But, not everything is going back into storage.  Namely Fosco's table and the Fantastic Jar.  When I try to do it, my movement is frozen.  Things can still animate around me, but I can't move, and it doesn't go to stash.  I have to press escape to open my Tales Log and it lets me move again, but the furniture is still there.  I can move the furniture, but I can't stash it.

I tried looking it up but I couldn't find anything.  Has anyone come across this and have tips??

* **Fish Tracking**: A handy check mark for every fish species you’ve caught. You’ll always know what’s left to reel in and when to find it.
* **Clothing + Tracking**: Window shop and keep track of all the outfits and accessories you’ve collected along the way.
* **Cooking**: View every meal with its recipe, required ingredients, and character cravings. You can also track which dishes you’ve cooked to work toward that final achievement! (It was my last one to 100% btw)
* **Furniture**: Browse every furniture piece, including shop items and those received as gifts after sharing meals. (The gift section is mostly complete, but I’d love help filling in the missing pieces.)
* **Characters**: See every character’s trading details, recipe unlocks by relationship rank, and seasonal meal cravings all in one handy place. It’s a little book… of all their little faces.

A note about tracking: Everything is stored locally in your browser. No logins, no ads, no data collection. Just cozy Hobbit magic.

A note about me: I’ve spent over 128+ hours playing Tales of the Shire on my Steam Deck as I recover from surgery. (It’s going...not great, please send healing vibes!) What started as a simple way for me to check planting companions, foraging seasons, and fishing info has grown into so much more than I expected. I hope it makes your own adventures a little easier too.

0f3ad4f2-9bac-4423-bc28-6f3b69655e81,1o9ajq6,No_Soil3938,"I'm almost finished with my third playthrough. I create challenges for myself with every new hobbit.

I wasn't allowed to sell fish in my second run and in my third run I wasn't allowed to sell fish and I could only buy seeds and things I can't get via trading, for example milk. You can only get that from Young Cotton so that's fine. 

It's pretty fun. Makes cooking slightly more difficult cause it's harder to change flavours, since you can't buy any seasonings. Making friends with Farmer Cotton for example is important cause you need the chickens, in order to get bacon grease from trading their eggs with Nefi. It's the only way to salt your dishes (not counting salt from gifts).

For my fourth run, i'm thinking of everything included above and not being allowed to make and sell jam (except for other recipes). It's way too easy to get money and increase cooking club skill by getting the jam recipes asap from Daisy and Rosie and just make and sell tons of jam.

Another idea is not using any 3* ingredients except seasonings (which you're not allowed to buy).

I wasn't allowed to sell fish in my second run and in my third run I wasn't allowed to sell fish and I could only buy seeds and things I can't get via trading, for example milk. You can only get that from Young Cotton so that's fine.

I am a dumb-dumb. If anyone else experiences this, force-quitting and restarting the game cleared this up. 

FINAL EDIT: It does seem to pop back up occasionally. Near as I can tell, it's triggered by errant button presses -- trying to cancel when I don't have anything selected, or trying to plant something while I'm not aimed at a garden plot. Best practice is definitely to aggressively save before entering decorating mode, just in case.


I'm on PS5

I'm over 40 hours into my save. Suddenly, the button to open and close decorating mode (holding the center touchpad) does nothing. 

The short press to open the map still works; the game definitely ""sees"" the button and it doesn't seem to be a controller issue.

I was in decorating mode when it happened, couldn't exit, and couldn't save. I lost an hour of progress. When I reloaded, it still wouldn't work. Now I can't open decorating mode -- I can't edit my house, I can't garden.

Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know of a fix? I've been loving this game and would be crushed if I had to abandon the game or even my save because of something like this 

EDIT: Just tried starting a new game. When I go to serve the first meal to Orlo -- which forces you in decorating mode -- none of the buttons work. The button to open meals/inventory does nothing. So I can't host meals, either. It seems like the entire concept of decorating mode is totally borked.",4,2,"Post: Decorating mode suddenly not working Comment: ...I feel so very silly. This worked!

I’ve been very busy since I last shared progress on my Tales of the Shire companion app, [The Burrow Book](http://theburrowbook.com). I’m excited to show you all the new things I’ve added!

Here’s what’s new since last time:

* **Fish Tracking**: A handy check mark for every fish species you’ve caught. You’ll always know what’s left to reel in and when to find it.
* **Clothing + Tracking**: Window shop and keep track of all the outfits and accessories you’ve collected along the way.
* **Cooking**: View every meal with its recipe, required ingredients, and character cravings. You can also track which dishes you’ve cooked to work toward that final achievement! (It was my last one to 100% btw)
* **Furniture**: Browse every furniture piece, including shop items and those received as gifts after sharing meals. (The gift section is mostly complete, but I’d love help filling in the missing pieces.)
* **Characters**: See every character’s trading details, recipe unlocks by relationship rank, and seasonal meal cravings all in one handy place. It’s a little book… of all their little faces.

A note about tracking: Everything is stored locally in your browser. No logins, no ads, no data collection. Just cozy Hobbit magic.

A note about me: I’ve spent over 128+ hours playing Tales of the Shire on my Steam Deck as I recover from surgery. (It’s going...not great, please send healing vibes!) What started as a simple way for me to check planting companions, foraging seasons, and fishing info has grown into so much more than I expected. I hope it makes your own adventures a little easier too.

If you’d like to take a peek, share feedback, or just want a no-nonsense game companion, you can visit [theburrowbook.com](http://theburrowbook.com).

If you’d like to help fill in some of the missing data you can message me here on Reddit. &lt;3

My partner and I have been loving this game all week, haha.",7,2025-08-02 09:52:13+00:00,My Honest Review Of TOTS,"

**Hello!** I recently did a [review ](https://youtu.be/n2JVXGe0944)of this game on my channel, and to be honest, I love it! Many said they don't, which is ok, preference is key. The art style is appealing, there is plenty to do, and though slow-moving at first, the game does have its fun moments. After playing it for a few hours, though, I could start to see a lot of the problematic game mechanics, or lack there-of. *I got my game for free, but this does not change my outlook.* Here is my quick review:

***PROS***

* Game is appealing on PC and mostly console.
*  Easy to understand, good for all ages.
* Style of game and noises make my brain happy.
* Not too many NPCs or too many places.
* You can say hi to animals!
*  Gardening is fun and interactable, and cooking is too.
*  I like the relationship system, but it is too easy.

***CONS***

* Not multiplayer. I know it's singleplayer, and was designed that way, but it was always advertised as ""play with friends"". They were implying the NPCs would become friends, I suppose.
* Minimap would be useful, the map is confusing to just keep pressing M.
* Nintendo Switch gameplay is a fever dream, it'll make you nauseous.
* Relationship system is too easy, I wish there were more things to do with NPCs like gift them items or more quests.
* Gameplay is very limited. The game itself has a good 6-8 hours of gameplay tops before it's just repetitive.
* Cooking is pressing buttons, I wish there was more to do!
* The game itself is very child-friendly, which I get it - They want ALL ages to understand and enjoy, but it feels like a tap to play game for the most part. I don't want war and fighting, I just want thorough and lore-filled!
* Hearing ""Lord of the Rings"" and then seeing a game that embodies the shire but doesn't through and through exemplify it is painful for my fangirl heart.
* Petting animals is lovely, but no owning them? No farming? It sucks to only see them in passing, and you can't even pet them.

***CONCLUSION***

I grew up watching LOTR, The Hobbit, and I have many collectibles and yapping hours on the topics. Does this make my opinion highest? No, not at all, but *I do wish the game brought The Shire and Hobbits to life more*. Hair on the feet and enjoying meals weren't the only things that made life so serene in that place. Having animals, interactable cooking, frolicking with friends - I just wish there was more. I am happy to see so many liked it and I did enjoy playing it!

**Hello!** I recently did a [review ](https://youtu.be/n2JVXGe0944)of this game on my channel, and to be honest, I love it! Many said they don't, which is ok, preference is key. The art style is appealing, there is plenty to do, and though slow-moving at first, the game does have its fun moments. After playing it for a few hours, though, I could start to see a lot of the problematic game mechanics, or lack there-of. *I got my game for free, but this does not change my outlook.* Here is my quick review:

***PROS***

* Game is appealing on PC and mostly console.
*  Easy to understand, good for all ages.
* Style of game and noises make my brain happy.
* Not too many NPCs or too many places.
* You can say hi to animals!
*  Gardening is fun and interactable, and cooking is too.
*  I like the relationship system, but it is too easy.

***CONS***

* Not multiplayer. I know it's singleplayer, and was designed that way, but it was always advertised as ""play with friends"". They were implying the NPCs would become friends, I suppose.
* Minimap would be useful, the map is confusing to just keep pressing M.
* Nintendo Switch gameplay is a fever dream, it'll make you nauseous.
* Relationship system is too easy, I wish there were more things to do with NPCs like gift them items or more quests.
* Gameplay is very limited. The game itself has a good 6-8 hours of gameplay tops before it's just repetitive.
* Cooking is pressing buttons, I wish there was more to do!
* The game itself is very child-friendly, which I get it - They want ALL ages to understand and enjoy, but it feels like a tap to play game for the most part. I don't want war and fighting, I just want thorough and lore-filled!
* Hearing ""Lord of the Rings"" and then seeing a game that embodies the shire but doesn't through and through exemplify it is painful for my fangirl heart.
* Petting animals is lovely, but no owning them? No farming? It sucks to only see them in passing, and you can't even pet them.

***CONCLUSION***

I grew up watching LOTR, The Hobbit, and I have many collectibles and yapping hours on the topics. Does this make my opinion highest? No, not at all, but *I do wish the game brought The Shire and Hobbits to life more*. Hair on the feet and enjoying meals weren't the only things that made life so serene in that place. Having animals, interactable cooking, frolicking with friends - I just wish there was more. I am happy to see so many liked it and I did enjoy playing it!

d1becb67-c734-42bb-8617-341952bba525,1mf3xjw,ConsiderationFlat155,"Okay I bought it on steam first but should have checked the specs cause it ran like crap on my pc. Not the games fault my laptop is 8 years old. BUT even with the lag I was seriously enjoying the game so I turned around and bought it on Xbox too so I could play without lag. I played six hours on steam and I’ve gotten 8 hours on xbox and IM HAVING A BLAST it is everything I could ever want in a cozy game and the nostalgia for me with hobbits is 10/10. 

I’ve had a visual glitch in Xbox twice where the screen goes black but all the UI is still visible so I just save and exit and reopen. Not the end of the world. 

I do think the dialogue could be optimized a little better. Talking to the npcs the flow is a little off idk how to explain it.

I've been following TotS all week, initially disappointed to read some of the early reviews, but I've kept reading posts from people having fun with it and thinking ""oh that does sound fun actually, I could see myself enjoying this...""

So fine, 10% off, did budget for it just in case, and the whole 2 hour refund policy on Steam... I'm off to become a hobbit. Hope I'm more of a green thumb in the Shire than I am in real life.

Anyone else taking the plunge after reading a lot about it this week?

Anyone been playing it and want to add your thoughts on the game, good or bad, or tips?",53,26,"Post: Oh alright go on then Comment: Okay I bought it on steam first but should have checked the specs cause it ran like crap on my pc. Not the games fault my laptop is 8 years old. BUT even with the lag I was seriously enjoying the game so I turned around and bought it on Xbox too so I could play without lag. I played six hours on steam and I’ve gotten 8 hours on xbox and IM HAVING A BLAST it is everything I could ever want in a cozy game and the nostalgia for me with hobbits is 10/10. 

I’ve had a visual glitch in Xbox twice where the screen goes black but all the UI is still visible so I just save and exit and reopen. Not the end of the world. 

I do think the dialogue could be optimized a little better. Talking to the npcs the flow is a little off idk how to explain it.

I got it on switch but I'm seriously considering refunding it and buying it on steam. I'm so torn, I literally can't decide! I would love to hear your feedback fellow hobbits.

SWITCH (the first one, not switch 2)

Pros: 
- I have already 6/7 hours on there, just finished the Clubs quest.
- I love having cosy games on switch, it makes me play them more often, because I can, haha, switch it to hand-held at any time

Cons:
- The graphics aren't the best, but it's not *that* much of a problem - although nicer graphics would be cool 
- Decorating is REALLY tedious. There's so many tiny items, it's really hard to place them and move them precisely

PC

Pros:
- From what I've seen, the graphics are much better on PC, and also the screen is bigger, that's nice
- A mouse. It would solve all my problems with decorating.

Cons: 
- No hand-held :( now I'm on vacation, so I have time to play, but after it's much easier to pull out the switch than play on PC for me
- The refund process for switch is quite tedious, I don't know how much time it'll take
- well, I would have to start over",3,14,"Post: I'm really torn deciding what platform to play on Comment: The convenience of portability is what made the decision easy for me to pick the Switch.

Good news is if you talk to any hobbit and you have an option to ask about the package, it’s theirs! The game is really good about not punishing you for things.",2,2025-08-07 03:02:20+00:00,Tips on pacing and priorities from someone who finished the main storyline.,"Hey everyone! I have been living and breathing this game since it came out, and with over 20 years of life sim / cozy game experience under my belt, I pretty much blitzed through the main storyline. Now that I'm in the epilogue, I've realized there are definitely a few things I wish I'd prioritized earlier. So, I thought I'd share some tips in case they help anyone else enjoy their time in the Shire a bit more!

  
First off, meals. As a bit of a perfectionist, I was determined to serve my guests the best meals. I would only host every few days so I could source every ingredient and get it just right. Looking back, it would have been better to host a meal every day. So much in this game is locked behind friendship rather than storyline. Plus, it's cute and cozy. So, don't stress about perfection, just invite folks over. Hobbits never turn down a meal!

  
Secondly, hoarding ingredients. I am a (virtual) hoarder. My hobbit's pantry is not full, but gosh, do I have tons of food. And not a lot of money. Or furniture or gardening plots. If I'd sold more forageables, fish, and crops instead of clinging to them, I could've had more garden plots, more furniture, and more access to higher-quality ingredients. It felt pretty lame to finish the main story while still using only the garden plots I started with and the couple I was gifted. That's my own fault, but take my advice and sell your stuff! You'll be able to do more, faster. 

  
Third, clubs. Clubs don't become available until partway through the story, but once they do, they're SO important. Not only do they unlock major upgrades that make life in the Shire smoother, but completing club tasks also builds friendship with club leaders. They're your key to unlocking better tools and a more fleshed-out game loop. Don't ignore them! 

  
Overall, the main storyline is cute and fun, but it isn't the heart of the game. The point is the vibe, the community. Tales of the Shire shines when you take your time and just live like a hobbit. So, take it from a speedgamer: slow down and let yourself marinate in the world. Host meals, even if they're simple. Decorate your space. Garden just because it's pleasant. Enjoy your neighbors. After all, hobbits are never in a hurry.

  
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to restart the game and follow my own advice this time! ",86,45,"Post: Tips on pacing and priorities from someone who finished the main storyline.

I almost started a new save but lucky just as I was writing this post, one of my saves worked and loaded me properly at the house. I have sent an email about it to support with the same screenshots as here, but for now, avoid logging out on docks to dodge this bug.

May the hair on your toes never fall out! Have fun everyone!

  
UPDATE: So it seems like this isn't a dock specific, but rather just kind of random. it seems loading an old save, having it load you properly, then exiting and going to your back to your most recent save seems to fix it.

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

Here's a Smarter Way to Make Money &amp; Progress**

I’d strongly advise *against* selling food, especially veggies or anything you find while foraging. Meals are way too important later on, and you’ll regret not having ingredients when you need them.  
HOWEVER, try to make as many meals as you can. Ideally at the end of each day. Even if it's smaller meals with not the best ingredients, everything goes towards friendship points!

**How I'm Making Money Toward Endgame**

Right now, my main cash flow is **fishing**. It’s been the most reliable way to make money *and* level up the Fishing Club at the same time. As you unlock better rods, you catch higher-quality fish that sell for more.

With a 15-slot inventory, I’ve pulled in **\~800 coins** per run, and not even all my fish were 2-stars or better, but most were. You can even hoard higher level fish and then run to sell ALL 3-star fish for a good amount.

**Don’t Sell Fish Right Away**

Make sure to keep **5–10 of each fish** in your pantry before you start selling. You’ll need them for cooking, and while fish are easy to catch, constantly having to recatch them is annoying later. All about balance. Once you’ve got a solid stash, go wild selling the extras for coins.

**Invest in Gardening (Early!)**

After you've saved up a bit from fishing, spend some of that cash on **gardening plots**. Don’t underestimate them, *even the smaller plots can hold a crazy number of seeds if you plan it right.* Once you’ve got a few plots going, you’ll pretty much never run out of veggies again. From there, just keep fishing to restock on seeds when needed.

**Foraging Club = Inventory Game-Changer**

Leveling the **Foraging Club** is high-key essential. I’m only at level 3, and already the extra 5 inventory slots have made a **huge** difference. Can’t wait to keep leveling it up for even more room.

**Level These NPCs for Decorating Unlocks**

If you’re into decorating your space, focus on **Nora**, **Fosco**, and **Willow**.

* I’ve got Nora and Fosco at **level 7**, and their shop selections for clothes and furniture have already expanded a ton.
* Planning to get both to **level 10** next so I can fully unlock everything.
* Willow’s great for additional furniture content, so keep her friendship rising too.

**Save Seasonal Forage Items!**

Make it a habit to **save fruits, nuts, and mushrooms from each season**. Why?

Because some recipes will call for specific ingredients that only grow during one season.  
For example: Need **plums**? Too bad if it’s spring, they only grow in **autumn**.  
Plan ahead, or you’ll be stuck waiting a full in-game year just to finish a meal.

**Cooking Tips You Might’ve Missed**

Ever wonder how to make food **crispy**? You’ll need an additional cooking station, specifically, the **Mixing Bowl**, which unlocks as you level up your Cooking skill. Sharing this because when I started playing, I was stuck wondering how to make food crispy in some recipes that I already had unlocked. As more cooking stations open,  you will have more options for flavor.

Also, not every ingredient will be compatible with the Fryer or Mixing Bowl. The more recipes you learn, the better you’ll get at combining the right stuff.

Lemme know if you're struggling to learn how to cook, I can help! Feel free to DM or comment on this thread, I will keep adding more things over time.

**How I'm Making Money Toward Endgame**

Right now, my main cash flow is **fishing**. It’s been the most reliable way to make money *and* level up the Fishing Club at the same time. As you unlock better rods, you catch higher-quality fish that sell for more.

With a 15-slot inventory, I’ve pulled in **\~800 coins** per run, and not even all my fish were 2-stars or better, but most were. You can even hoard higher level fish and then run to sell ALL 3-star fish for a good amount.

**Don’t Sell Fish Right Away**

Make sure to keep **5–10 of each fish** in your pantry before you start selling. You’ll need them for cooking, and while fish are easy to catch, constantly having to recatch them is annoying later. All about balance. Once you’ve got a solid stash, go wild selling the extras for coins.

**Invest in Gardening (Early!)**

After you've saved up a bit from fishing, spend some of that cash on **gardening plots**. Don’t underestimate them, *even the smaller plots can hold a crazy number of seeds if you plan it right.* Once you’ve got a few plots going, you’ll pretty much never run out of veggies again. From there, just keep fishing to restock on seeds when needed.

**Foraging Club = Inventory Game-Changer**

Leveling the **Foraging Club** is high-key essential. I’m only at level 3, and already the extra 5 inventory slots have made a **huge** difference. Can’t wait to keep leveling it up for even more room.

**Level These NPCs for Decorating Unlocks**

If you’re into decorating your space, focus on **Nora**, **Fosco**, and **Willow**.

* I’ve got Nora and Fosco at **level 7**, and their shop selections for clothes and furniture have already expanded a ton.
* Planning to get both to **level 10** next so I can fully unlock everything.
* Willow’s great for additional furniture content, so keep her friendship rising too.

**Save Seasonal Forage Items!**

Make it a habit to **save fruits, nuts, and mushrooms from each season**. Why?

Because some recipes will call for specific ingredients that only grow during one season.  
For example: Need **plums**? Too bad if it’s spring, they only grow in **autumn**.  
Plan ahead, or you’ll be stuck waiting a full in-game year just to finish a meal.

**Cooking Tips You Might’ve Missed**

Ever wonder how to make food **crispy**? You’ll need an additional cooking station, specifically, the **Mixing Bowl**, which unlocks as you level up your Cooking skill. Sharing this because when I started playing, I was stuck wondering how to make food crispy in some recipes that I already had unlocked. As more cooking stations open,  you will have more options for flavor.

Also, not every ingredient will be compatible with the Fryer or Mixing Bowl. The more recipes you learn, the better you’ll get at combining the right stuff.

It doesn’t matter if your seasoning is 1-star, it won’t diminish the quality of the main ingredient. Use your 1-star seasonings on 3-star ingredients and save your 3-star seasonings for when you’re trying to improve the quality of 2 or 1-star ingredients. Basically, using high quality seasonings on high quality ingredients is a waste!

Prepare and season every step (if you can) I find this usually grants the “flavorful” bonus and somehow makes the dish better quality somehow, even if the ingredients are already 3-star and the texture doesn’t have to be improved. Doing something with that ingredient improves the value.

Jams will get you a lot more money than regular berries. Also use some of your leftover 2 or 3-star seasonings when making jams to make them more valuable! Strawberry is the most valuable! 

Prices per jam:
Apricot 42, 63, 84
Blackberry 36, 54, 72
Cranberry 30, 45, 60
Elderberry 24, 36, 48
Peach 36, 54, 72
Plum 36, 54, 72
Raspberry 30, 45, 60
Strawberry 96, 144, 192

Use jams to your advantage when flavoring dishes. If a recipe calls for jam, go ahead and season that so you have more room to tweak the flavor of the dish.

Gardening hacks:

Keep wells and water troughs nearby, you can fill your watering can with them.

Water more than one planting bed at a time by standing close to each

Buy crop seeds that will yield more than one harvest or more than one item per harvest (beans, peas, garlic, shallots, strawberries, tomatoes, all potatoes, cucumbers, peppers, rhubarb, marrow, maize, herbs etc.). They sell for the most money!

Use flowers to your advantage. Obtain flower seeds by trading jams with Rosie. If you don’t have the jam recipes, trade foraged goods with Delphi for jams. Flowers act as companion plants to everything. Harebells, gerberas, and sunflowers sell for the most money and you always get seeds from harvesting them.

That’s all I have for now!!",64,2,"Post: Cooking and gardening like a pro! Comment: Thank you so much for these tips!

But I really feel on all levels that the game wasn't released in the state the developers intended and that too many things are missing to make it a ""complete"" game in my eyes.



I would really like some communication from the developers at Weta to show their long-term interest in the game.



What I would really like:



\- A technique to review on consoles. On PS5 or Xbox, the game should be able to run perfectly at 40 or 60 fps. It struggles to maintain 30 on PS5...

\- Interactions with the scenery and objects. It's unfair to have such a beautiful sofa and not be able to sit on it, to have a hot cup of tea and not be able to drink it...

\- Random and seasonal events. Something to bring a little life to this charming village. It's crazy to create such a place and leave it lifeless outside of story quests!

\- Romance? I know some people see little point in that. Yet, many games of this genre offer that, and it adds a little more life and interaction to the world and the game!

\- More outfits!

\- More dialogue with NPCs, outside of quests! It's so quiet outside of story quests...

\- Visiting other residents' houses and being invited into their homes. Why does my dear hobbit avatar always have to do all the work???

\- Many other ideas (organizing parties, having a pet, customizing furniture and objects, etc.) that could further flesh out the game. But already, the ideas above would make it much more substantial and make it feel like a truly finished game.

Some of critiques I get, like the art style or the bugs. But some of the reviews make zero sense and it just seems like the game is getting bombed because the reviews don't know what they're doing. One person complained they had to stop playing when they were tasked with Nefi's hammer because they couldn't find the hammer and the birds only led you to Nefi and she couldn't be bothered to hunt all over the Shire for the hammer. Um...the birds are leading you to Nefi because that's ALSO WHERE THE HAMMER IS. Nefi tells you EXACTLY where the hammer is. I guess the birds could have been a little more obvious but the game shouldn't have to hold your hand every step of the way. Another reviewer liked the mechanic of using the birds to show your path but they don't point which direction you should be going and they don't tell you if you made a wrong turn. Both statements are completely wrong.

This is so impressive",3,2025-08-31 14:31:00+00:00,I cooked all meals at 5-star,"After completing this challenge I set for myself, here are some cooking tips I have for early/mid-gamers:
- Bitter dishes are the rarest. 3-star bitter seasonings are harder to come by, so forage and plant more when you can, especially in spring.
- Sweet flavour goes well with everything so sweet seasonings are important. Bitter only goes well with sweet. This brings up the next tip: 
- Prioritise maxing out relationship with Lily Cotton. She could well be one of the most important villagers to max out asap because of her 3-star butter trade at level 10. Butter is important because it is the sweet seasoning to cook with the frying pan, the only way to add seasonings to meat.
- Spicy and salty dishes are incredibly easy to make as long as you have enough black pepper and salt. 
- Sour dishes are incredibly fun to make. Often times you get the flavour from the ingredients without needing to use any sour seasoning. But when you have to, raisin and chives are the most versatile.

I shrugged it off thinking I just imagined things. My garden is very large so I didn’t notice that it wasn’t spinach that got planted ‘til a couple days later. So I went back to buy more seeds (just spinach and its companions) and it happened again. So now I only have a few days left in winter and I haven’t been able to plant any spinach.

The day Tales of the Shire released on Switch, July 29th 2025, I bought it. Or rather, I had pre-ordered the physical version but it wouldn’t be out for another week so I cancelled that order and bought the digital version on the Nintendo store.

Anyway, despite minor bugs here and there, I really enjoyed it and played it nearly every day. My last day playing it was August 25th in the evening. I docked my switch, went to bed. I worked all day yesterday but due to my law enforcement schedule I have today off.

Got up bright and early to play the game. When I went into the game it froze on the main screen and would not let me exit the game.
I turned off the screen, turned it on and it let me exit the game. When went back into the game to informed me that the game now has an autosave feature, which I was excited for.

But then the main menu opened up and I could only start a new game, all my save data was gone. I contacted Nintendo and they did all of their trouble shooting and informed me the issue was no on their end and to contacts the TOTS Support. I went to their website and there’s no number, only an email.

I’ve emailed them. But has anyone else had this issue?

This game is everything I like in a cozy game. I am 50 hours in and still enjoying it so much. I think the initial bad reviews just didn’t play the game long enough because it’s clear the longer you play the more it opens up. There are definitely some ways it could be improved and I hope they do so or maybe make a new game with all the things that people say they want but this game as it is for the price tag is worth it.

All that said, if canon is too rigid it stops being fun and starts being rules. LOTR wouldn't exist if Tolkien hadn't retconned a major moment in The Hobbit over a decade after it was published.

While doing so, I noticed that the articles were listed as coming from a ""Non-Canon"" source...

My gods, do I *dislike* that. 

I really think the Fanbase (and other fanbases in general) really needs to get away with worrying *so much* about canon. In the ""Lord of the Rings"" Canon, Tolkien intended for the books to be an imperfect source. They are - as written - Tolkien's translations of the Red Book of Westmarch, which in turn is the writings and stories of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, with additions by Samwise Gamgee. The Appendices? Bilbo's *best guess* at trying to reconcile the histories of Men, Hobbits, Dwarves and Elves, as well as the *Mythology* of the Silmarillion, into a cohesive whole. 

Maybe it was all just a *little* inaccurate.

So who cares if Tales of the Shire is separate from the stories that were written down? Who's to say that it's ""Non-Canonical"" and chuck it in the ""Spin-off"" bin of second-rate stories? It's fun, it's cute, it's so very *Hobbitish* (lacking, though, in ales and pipeweed). So long as it's not rewriting major moments (e.g. our Hobbit coming across a sinister golden Ring, or riders cloaked all in black coming to Bywater) it really should be any sort of hang-up or issue enough to be denoted as ""Non-Canon"". It just throws a poor light on it all, says I.

I’m devastated.,"After 100 hours of playtime and reaching my second winter, dodging and wrestling with bugs all the way, the unthinkable has happened. My save files have completely disappeared for no apparent reason. My game froze while I was working on my garden, so I saved and exited the game, like I have many times. When I loaded back in, my files were gone. 

I’m… numb lol. This is an actual nightmare. 

I’ve emailed support of course, but I have little hope of getting anything back. It seems my time with this game is over, and that just really, really sucks, because i had every intention of playing for years.

If you’re playing on switch and have started encountering the bug where your character randomly gets stuck and can’t walk anywhere… be careful. This may happen to you if you keep playing and getting around it by reloading saves. I wish I could tell you how to avoid it… sorry.

I’m thankful I got some pics before losing it all. I will miss being Jessamine Greenhand so very very much. I’m going to go cry now. 😞",144,67,Post: Lost my files (100+ hrs). I’m devastated.

That said, I think there are some improvements that can be made. Here's a few I thought of, and I'd love to see anyone else's ideas in the comments!

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

I'm not generally a cozy game player, but I felt like the atmosphere and setting of this game would go a long way for me! And I am happy to say that I have spent over 30 hours fully engrossed and in love with the game!

That said, I think there are some improvements that can be made. Here's a few I thought of, and I'd love to see anyone else's ideas in the comments!

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

But yeah, how DOES it works? I'm talking about the flavors. Sometime I'm cooking dishes with ""uncertain flavor"" by default but depending on the ingredient they'll get certain flavors but I'm unable to really understand which ingredient will be the defining flavor...

For example:

I tried cooking a **Cool Taters and Beans**.  
I used Maize (**sweet**), Beans (**bitter**), Brown Onion (**spicy**) and Brown Tater (**sweet**). I thought that because there was 2 ingredients marked as sweet, the plate would be sweet... So I decided to use the frying pan on the Brown Tater to make them salty since that's the flavor I needed. 

The dish ended up being **Spicy** for some reason???

is there a way to know and control what flavor the dish will have, other than using ONLY ingredient of that one flavor?? Is there a certain order to follow? What Am I not getting exactly?

SWITCH (the first one, not switch 2)

Pros: 
- I have already 6/7 hours on there, just finished the Clubs quest.
- I love having cosy games on switch, it makes me play them more often, because I can, haha, switch it to hand-held at any time

Cons:
- The graphics aren't the best, but it's not *that* much of a problem - although nicer graphics would be cool 
- Decorating is REALLY tedious. There's so many tiny items, it's really hard to place them and move them precisely

PC

Pros:
- From what I've seen, the graphics are much better on PC, and also the screen is bigger, that's nice
- A mouse. It would solve all my problems with decorating.

Cons: 
- No hand-held :( now I'm on vacation, so I have time to play, but after it's much easier to pull out the switch than play on PC for me
- The refund process for switch is quite tedious, I don't know how much time it'll take

i made the mistake of watching reviews whilst it was downloading and thought i have made a mistake, but to be honest i absolutely love it. never played cozy games before so all the mechanincs are pretty new to me. i love zoning out to boring grinds and the small map isnt stressful or overwhelming. plays true to hobbits not liking to wander too far from home tbh lol.

made up i found this sub and can see other people appreciating it for what it is. i was a little gutted when i saw how better the graphics are on the pc, i have a pc but the mobile nature of the switch means i will play it alot more than that version.

6 hours in and taking it slow. i hope it gets the patches it has been promised and deserves but i feel i have tens of hours worth of game time before they bother me.

i have found some of the dialogue genuinely made me lol.

one thing though if anyone can help? i have totally ran out of money, i have a pantry full of bits to sell but non of the village folk seem to offer to buy them from me? i have tried taking fish veg and meals.

sorry for the lack of pics i am on switch but when i have a hobbit hole to be proud of i will figure a way to get them off the device.

doubt it will happen but some sort of multiplayer, visiting others hobbit holes etc would be a dream.

The fish should start moving back towards you with normal fishing mechanic restored but you have to do this with every fish bc for some reason it no longer reads your first ZR press. 
———————
(Original post and bug before fix) 

So I’ve looked online at fishing glitches and haven’t seen this specific one, so if anyone has any help…I’ve tried the save, shut down, and restart (playing on a Nintendo switch), I’ve tried fishing at new places, I’ve tried as best as I can figure out what folks mean and how and when to do it, the ZR thing…

So I was able to fish easily for a good amount of time into the gameplay until I got stuck on the (spoiler alert read on at own risk) 2-star veggie quest for a long time, during that suddenly I went from catching fish fine to not being able to catch a fish to save my life…they keep getting away and swimming to the opposite shore even though the tension on the line is still blue, and I’m reeling and pulling in the opposite direction and all (checked the controls, saved, shut down and restarted the game, checked to make sure latest version) and the problem is I think, the game seems to mark that as the time you need an upgraded rod, but I can’t upgrade the rod because even after unlocking all the clubs, I’m still stuck.

 My next quest is the make 4 meals of the village dish which I can’t do because I can’t catch one. 

I love this game so much but this is so frustrating (edited out the asking for a refund thing bc I love the game too much) just have been playing and trying various in game and out of game things to fix the problem for probably over 20 hours now (not in a row no worries) of game time? 

Anyway any help, thoughts, ideas, commiseration, anything would be welcome!",3,8,Post: I think I found a whole new fishing glitch and am stuck in the game progress?

Like animal crossing, even after you get a toolring, you have to go through the little animation of pulling out your cute little shovel, then again when you put it away, and whenever you enter or exit a building or talk to someone. Tales of the Shire, however, has a similar toolring only unlocked from the start, and you're not even required to use it! You can just pop out your fishing rod, without an endless animation!  
And the actual fishing mechanics... Glorious. Fishing is usually my favorite part of games, and I especially prefer it when it's less of a timing thing and more of a fighting-the-fish, where you know you're almost certainly going to catch the fish. The casting part takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it it feels much more realistic and comfortable than a lot of other games.  
I love how the watering can is designed to make watering the garden a low-drama thing, as opposed to Stardew Valley. Tales has no stamina bar--the only delay is refilling the can--and you can water two raised beds at once.  
I haven't really experimented with the lantern much, but it's really nice to have a low-drama light source at night. And the little swinging animation... SO! CUTE!

So I’ve looked online at fishing glitches and haven’t seen this specific one, so if anyone has any help…I’ve tried the save, shut down, and restart (playing on a Nintendo switch), I’ve tried fishing at new places, I’ve tried as best as I can figure out what folks mean and how and when to do it, the ZR thing…

So I was able to fish easily for a good amount of time into the gameplay until I got stuck on the (spoiler alert read on at own risk) 2-star veggie quest for a long time, during that suddenly I went from catching fish fine to not being able to catch a fish to save my life…they keep getting away and swimming to the opposite shore even though the tension on the line is still blue, and I’m reeling and pulling in the opposite direction and all (checked the controls, saved, shut down and restarted the game, checked to make sure latest version) and the problem is I think, the game seems to mark that as the time you need an upgraded rod, but I can’t upgrade the rod because even after unlocking all the clubs, I’m still stuck.

 My next quest is the make 4 meals of the village dish which I can’t do because I can’t catch one. 

I love this game so much but this is so frustrating (edited out the asking for a refund thing bc I love the game too much) just have been playing and trying various in game and out of game things to fix the problem for probably over 20 hours now (not in a row no worries) of game time?

I really love the tool ring on the controller too, pressing the left arrow button etc. to shift through them is even more fluid than on mouse and keyboard.

I also got really frustrated with Animal Crossing (if I remember correctly), I never did check to see if I could turn it off though. Crazy how just that extra second felt really janky and slow to do different things.

So yes a lot to appreciate. (I adore the bird trail literally pointing the way, kept in theme with nature to be subtle but also hella useful as I have no sense of direction, so really appreciate it when no mini map lol).",2,2025-08-06 13:50:20+00:00,Does anyone else really appreciate the tool mechanics?,"Something I find really irritating in games is when pulling out your tool takes forever. Like animal crossing, even after you get a toolring, you have to go through the little animation of pulling out your cute little shovel, then again when you put it away, and whenever you enter or exit a building or talk to someone. Tales of the Shire, however, has a similar toolring only unlocked from the start, and you're not even required to use it! You can just pop out your fishing rod, without an endless animation!  
And the actual fishing mechanics... Glorious. Fishing is usually my favorite part of games, and I especially prefer it when it's less of a timing thing and more of a fighting-the-fish, where you know you're almost certainly going to catch the fish. The casting part takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it it feels much more realistic and comfortable than a lot of other games.  
I love how the watering can is designed to make watering the garden a low-drama thing, as opposed to Stardew Valley. Tales has no stamina bar--the only delay is refilling the can--and you can water two raised beds at once.  
I haven't really experimented with the lantern much, but it's really nice to have a low-drama light source at night. And the little swinging animation... SO! CUTE!

Anyway, before starting my 4Realz game, it occurred to me that the gameplay was very much like a tutorial and very linear. I'm debating whether to refund, but wondering if my impression is skewed because I wasn't taking time to smell the roses. My playtime ended with finding the book in the locked drawer.

Does the gameplay continue to feel like a tutorial?

After hosting many dinner parties, I am sure people have started finding out who they like to have together. Personally I have a set system for leveling friendship and not leaving anyone out but I still have some favorite get togethers.

Right now I like to have the whole Cotton family for one dinner. Next I have ""Grumpy Men Club"" with Sandyman, Noaks, Hobson, and Orlo to balance things out. Though if I am being honest ""Grumpy Men"" club should really be Sandyman, Noaks, and Farmer Cotton lol. I like to have Delphinium, Willow, and Daisy over together since they are neighbors. And my last grouping is Nora, Fosco, Marigold, and Nefi. I think my favorite is Delphinium, Willow, and Daisy though. They're kind of my favorites right now.

But that's me ""optimizing"" to ensure I get max friendship. Here's who I like to pair together for funsies:

Farmer Cotton and Sandyman. Those two are going to learn to play nice dammit!

Young Tom, Nefi, and Orlo. Not gonna lie I really liked Nefi and Young Tom's interactions and think they would be cute together, and in order for it to not be awkward I invite Orlo as my ""date.""

Anyway, before starting my 4Realz game, it occurred to me that the gameplay was very much like a tutorial and very linear. I'm debating whether to refund, but wondering if my impression is skewed because I wasn't taking time to smell the roses. My playtime ended with finding the book in the locked drawer.

Does the gameplay continue to feel like a tutorial?

Can you take your time doing fetch quests (I was basically running from one to another), or do they need to be completed within a certain timeframe?

How much replayability do you think TotS has?

1. They don't play cozy games. They may have enjoyed Stardew Valley, but let's be real, that had a LOT more content than any typical cozy game has. That's likely their main point of comparison.
2. Cozy games (as a whole) need to do better, and we need to be careful not to ignore their flaws.

I'm loving my time as a hobbit in Bywater. I'm mostly playing on PC, but occasionally my wife wants to watch me play on our Switch 2. Personally, the art style is good enough that going from great performance with max settings on my PC to Switch 2 (which admittedly has better performance than Switch 1) doesn't bother me in the slightest. That being said, I understand the complaints on console. Palia takes a lot of deserved heat for Switch performance, and so should TOTS.

Cozy games are known for under-performing in any imaginable way. The problem is, cozy-gamers are so hungry for content that they're willing to overlook flaws. Also, being critical is often seen as ""un-cozy"" and we see in-fighting among ourselves saying things like ""don't like it, don't play it"" which is nothing but harmful to consumers. This leads to situations like Pathea beginning work on (and the Kickstarter for) Portia's sequel before Portia was remotely finished, which was entirely unethical.

There are not competent. In over their head, and should have been working for a better developer to put this game together. Look at Return to Moria. What a well made game that is. Also from an indie developer. That is a larger scale game. But how do I wish that dev would have been in charge of making a simple 3GB village game like this.","Post: Why is every big company talking trash about TotS?

Once more fishing spots opened up, I was enjoying that more as that's my money maker. So being able to be close by town square and fish a spot that had way more fish available and go sell them quickly was nice. Especially now that I have the rod upgrade.

**Hello!** I recently did a [review ](https://youtu.be/n2JVXGe0944)of this game on my channel, and to be honest, I love it! Many said they don't, which is ok, preference is key. The art style is appealing, there is plenty to do, and though slow-moving at first, the game does have its fun moments. After playing it for a few hours, though, I could start to see a lot of the problematic game mechanics, or lack there-of. *I got my game for free, but this does not change my outlook.* Here is my quick review:

***PROS***

* Game is appealing on PC and mostly console.
*  Easy to understand, good for all ages.
* Style of game and noises make my brain happy.
* Not too many NPCs or too many places.
* You can say hi to animals!
*  Gardening is fun and interactable, and cooking is too.
*  I like the relationship system, but it is too easy.

***CONS***

* Not multiplayer. I know it's singleplayer, and was designed that way, but it was always advertised as ""play with friends"". They were implying the NPCs would become friends, I suppose.
* Minimap would be useful, the map is confusing to just keep pressing M.
* Nintendo Switch gameplay is a fever dream, it'll make you nauseous.
* Relationship system is too easy, I wish there were more things to do with NPCs like gift them items or more quests.
* Gameplay is very limited. The game itself has a good 6-8 hours of gameplay tops before it's just repetitive.
* Cooking is pressing buttons, I wish there was more to do!
* The game itself is very child-friendly, which I get it - They want ALL ages to understand and enjoy, but it feels like a tap to play game for the most part. I don't want war and fighting, I just want thorough and lore-filled!
* Hearing ""Lord of the Rings"" and then seeing a game that embodies the shire but doesn't through and through exemplify it is painful for my fangirl heart.
* Petting animals is lovely, but no owning them? No farming? It sucks to only see them in passing, and you can't even pet them.

***CONCLUSION***

I grew up watching LOTR, The Hobbit, and I have many collectibles and yapping hours on the topics. Does this make my opinion highest? No, not at all, but *I do wish the game brought The Shire and Hobbits to life more*. Hair on the feet and enjoying meals weren't the only things that made life so serene in that place. Having animals, interactable cooking, frolicking with friends - I just wish there was more. I am happy to see so many liked it and I did enjoy playing it!

Second playthrough I’m selling or trading everything I have more than 9 of (5 for fish) and I’ve been happy so far. The game is incredibly forgiving in regards to needing certain items. Hobbits are happy (to various degrees) with any meal you will serve, and no quests require season-specific ingredients or recipes. The most important thing is to have fun, whatever that means to you 😊",3,2025-08-05 21:36:12+00:00,Tips on pacing and priorities from someone who finished the main storyline.,"Hey everyone! I have been living and breathing this game since it came out, and with over 20 years of life sim / cozy game experience under my belt, I pretty much blitzed through the main storyline. Now that I'm in the epilogue, I've realized there are definitely a few things I wish I'd prioritized earlier. So, I thought I'd share some tips in case they help anyone else enjoy their time in the Shire a bit more!

  
First off, meals. As a bit of a perfectionist, I was determined to serve my guests the best meals. I would only host every few days so I could source every ingredient and get it just right. Looking back, it would have been better to host a meal every day. So much in this game is locked behind friendship rather than storyline. Plus, it's cute and cozy. So, don't stress about perfection, just invite folks over. Hobbits never turn down a meal!

  
Secondly, hoarding ingredients. I am a (virtual) hoarder. My hobbit's pantry is not full, but gosh, do I have tons of food. And not a lot of money. Or furniture or gardening plots. If I'd sold more forageables, fish, and crops instead of clinging to them, I could've had more garden plots, more furniture, and more access to higher-quality ingredients. It felt pretty lame to finish the main story while still using only the garden plots I started with and the couple I was gifted. That's my own fault, but take my advice and sell your stuff! You'll be able to do more, faster. 

  
Third, clubs. Clubs don't become available until partway through the story, but once they do, they're SO important. Not only do they unlock major upgrades that make life in the Shire smoother, but completing club tasks also builds friendship with club leaders. They're your key to unlocking better tools and a more fleshed-out game loop. Don't ignore them! 

  
Overall, the main storyline is cute and fun, but it isn't the heart of the game. The point is the vibe, the community. Tales of the Shire shines when you take your time and just live like a hobbit. So, take it from a speedgamer: slow down and let yourself marinate in the world. Host meals, even if they're simple. Decorate your space. Garden just because it's pleasant. Enjoy your neighbors. After all, hobbits are never in a hurry.

  
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to restart the game and follow my own advice this time! ",86,45,"Post: Tips on pacing and priorities from someone who finished the main storyline. Comment: Go get you some jam with those mustards and trade em for flowers! So great.

I’d strongly advise *against* selling food, especially veggies or anything you find while foraging. Meals are way too important later on, and you’ll regret not having ingredients when you need them.  
HOWEVER, try to make as many meals as you can. Ideally at the end of each day. Even if it's smaller meals with not the best ingredients, everything goes towards friendship points!

Right now, my main cash flow is **fishing**. It’s been the most reliable way to make money *and* level up the Fishing Club at the same time. As you unlock better rods, you catch higher-quality fish that sell for more.

With a 15-slot inventory, I’ve pulled in **\~800 coins** per run, and not even all my fish were 2-stars or better, but most were. You can even hoard higher level fish and then run to sell ALL 3-star fish for a good amount.

**Don’t Sell Fish Right Away**

Make sure to keep **5–10 of each fish** in your pantry before you start selling. You’ll need them for cooking, and while fish are easy to catch, constantly having to recatch them is annoying later. All about balance. Once you’ve got a solid stash, go wild selling the extras for coins.

**Invest in Gardening (Early!)**

After you've saved up a bit from fishing, spend some of that cash on **gardening plots**. Don’t underestimate them, *even the smaller plots can hold a crazy number of seeds if you plan it right.* Once you’ve got a few plots going, you’ll pretty much never run out of veggies again. From there, just keep fishing to restock on seeds when needed.

**Foraging Club = Inventory Game-Changer**

Leveling the **Foraging Club** is high-key essential. I’m only at level 3, and already the extra 5 inventory slots have made a **huge** difference. Can’t wait to keep leveling it up for even more room.

**Level These NPCs for Decorating Unlocks**

If you’re into decorating your space, focus on **Nora**, **Fosco**, and **Willow**.

* I’ve got Nora and Fosco at **level 7**, and their shop selections for clothes and furniture have already expanded a ton.
* Planning to get both to **level 10** next so I can fully unlock everything.
* Willow’s great for additional furniture content, so keep her friendship rising too.

**Save Seasonal Forage Items!**

Make it a habit to **save fruits, nuts, and mushrooms from each season**. Why?

Because some recipes will call for specific ingredients that only grow during one season.  
For example: Need **plums**? Too bad if it’s spring, they only grow in **autumn**.  
Plan ahead, or you’ll be stuck waiting a full in-game year just to finish a meal.

**Cooking Tips You Might’ve Missed**

Ever wonder how to make food **crispy**? You’ll need an additional cooking station, specifically, the **Mixing Bowl**, which unlocks as you level up your Cooking skill. Sharing this because when I started playing, I was stuck wondering how to make food crispy in some recipes that I already had unlocked. As more cooking stations open,  you will have more options for flavor.

Also, not every ingredient will be compatible with the Fryer or Mixing Bowl. The more recipes you learn, the better you’ll get at combining the right stuff.

a5764bee-5bb0-49be-81f0-6a88578b54a0,1me1zxy,PlatypusTop6435,"My pros:  
- Concept of the game is really cute and cozy. I love the slow pace.  
- The art you see when the game starts is so pretty.  
- Foraging is my favorite part of the game. I just love walking around and finding stuff.  
- Gardening is great too and I love that they included companion planting.  
- I feel like I'm in a minority here, but I actually like the blue bird navigation system, so cute. I don't mind getting lost every once in a while.  
- Skipping makes me so happy.  
- Cooking is pretty cool. Took me a while to figure out how to use the seasonings and frying pan, but I think I've got it now.  
- Love the different times of the day and seasons changing. Days and seasons could be a bit longer, though.  
- The game has so much potential and I really hope there will be patches, updates, DLC, etc.  
  
My cons:  
- Lots of clipping and glitching. Ceilings and walls disappearing, falling through floors, seeing the scalp of my hobbit despite her having a full head of hair, etc.  
- No music most of the time and the overall volume is really quiet.  
- Graphics on my OLED Switch are rough. Like *is this game from 2006 or something* rough. I've seen videos of PC gameplay and it looks so much better.  
- The background NPCs are kinda creepy and zombie-like. Hate the way they just stand there with a blank stare.  
- While there are decorating options, many are more or less the same. I need at least more colors.  
- Same goes for appearance. Would love more options and I'd kill for more blush and some freckles. Also, what's with the heavy black eyeliner? Personally not a big fan.

- Concept of the game is really cute and cozy. I love the slow pace.  
- The art you see when the game starts is so pretty.  
- Foraging is my favorite part of the game. I just love walking around and finding stuff.  
- Gardening is great too and I love that they included companion planting.  
- I feel like I'm in a minority here, but I actually like the blue bird navigation system, so cute. I don't mind getting lost every once in a while.  
- Skipping makes me so happy.  
- Cooking is pretty cool. Took me a while to figure out how to use the seasonings and frying pan, but I think I've got it now.  
- Love the different times of the day and seasons changing. Days and seasons could be a bit longer, though.  
- The game has so much potential and I really hope there will be patches, updates, DLC, etc.  
  
My cons:  
- Lots of clipping and glitching. Ceilings and walls disappearing, falling through floors, seeing the scalp of my hobbit despite her having a full head of hair, etc.  
- No music most of the time and the overall volume is really quiet.  
- Graphics on my OLED Switch are rough. Like *is this game from 2006 or something* rough. I've seen videos of PC gameplay and it looks so much better.  
- The background NPCs are kinda creepy and zombie-like. Hate the way they just stand there with a blank stare.  
- While there are decorating options, many are more or less the same. I need at least more colors.  
- Same goes for appearance. Would love more options and I'd kill for more blush and some freckles. Also, what's with the heavy black eyeliner? Personally not a big fan.

I will say, after waiting for this game for a year now, then watching three push back dates, I was a bit disappointed in graphic quality. I have an OLED and I agree with OP about it looking much nicer on PC than it does on the switch. But somehow the bad graphics almost feel nostalgic and I don't mind tooooo much? lol 

I would say this game definitely needs a few things, which I agree w/ a lot of the comments. I think the graphics could be better, especially if you accidentally get too close to something and all of a sudden you're looking at your Hobbit's scalp. In decorating, something I noticed was I couldn't get close to the wall in birds-eye view (to make sure I place it close enough/right angle) without moving me hobbit which obstructed the ability to put it down, so navigating that took a second. I also wish the quests would give you more than 20 coins, given that everything in the shops are expensive. 

I do agree that there should be more customization! I was a little sad to see options so limited (I mean don't get me wrong it was still plentiful) I just wish there was a little more? Especially hairstyles. And do the mouths look weird to you guys too??? for me there were 2 mouths that looked normal and the rest were like a horror movie lol. 

Overall, if you're someone who doesn't mind graphic strength (I love Hogwarts legacy on my OLED hence why I don't mind the graphics for this so much) I think the game is really great. It's BRAND NEW, so I expect that updates and DLC's will be coming our way to increasingly improve game performance/item increases ect. At least I hope so. 

TL/DR:  
If you're not picky with graphics, you'll love it! Ultimate cozy game. Since it's so brand new, of course there are things that need to be improved but I have hope for future updates and DLCs!",11,2025-07-31 15:33:28+00:00,What do you like and dislike about Tales of the Shire?,I wanna hear your Pros and Cons 🍃,30,56,"Post: What do you like and dislike about Tales of the Shire?

I’ve now played the first couple of hours, and while it n
Is laid-back in tone and pleasant visuals, I’m a quite underwhelmed overall.

The Shire looks cute (if a little low-poly in places), the music is gentle, and has all the elements of cozy sims. But there’s a lot missing in it, like atmosphere and connection. There’s no major story it seems so far, and the early characters feel flat and overly tutorial-driven and the humour didn’t land for me.

The cooking system starts very simple but does get more interesting with new recipes, and I like that there’s some depth in adjusting texture/taste. Fishing is basic but functional, gardening is minimal, and the daily routine loop seems manageable, definitely not stressful. So I don’t think the early reviews calling it “shallow” are wrong, but there is a bit of charm here, and maybe it just needs more time.

I put together a quick “first look” post with a breakdown of my early thoughts if anyone’s curious before buying for themselves.

How are you guys finding it? Does it open up more later on? Wondering if I just hit a slow patch in the beginning or if this is kind of the pace and tone throughout.",0,4,"Post: First Look Review after 2 Hours Comment: From my own view, t's about as in depth as Animal Crossing: New Horizons was.

I like the idea of petting the animals too, great thing to add, it is cute when you greet them they sit down, I wonder if this is to be helpful in photo mode?

I would like to close the door too.

It would be nice to edit the meal plan invitation, to add a field to write your own bit into it to be more personable.

""Hullo Sandyman and Farmer Cotton, I think I'd like us all to sit down and talk about.... ""

It would be cool to get invites and enter other hobbit homes, 
+ experiment with recipes,
+ have a pub meal
All that will give a little light bulb moment for a new recipe idea.

It would be nice to have recipes have a real world IRL link to make a recipe based off the dish you've made.
Fish pie, Rhubarb... 
Like I think there was a cook book from LoTR that gave inspired recipes to make something like Lembas Bread (I hope that might be in ToTS tbh).

I'd like to jump, and I don't mind about not being able to swim.

It would be nice to have more dialogue that mix and matches so it isn't exactly the same goodbye from what I've noticed.

+ it seems strange can't buy any items from the pub...

It would be nice if we had a dialogue pop up box from punters and other Hobbits that came up in a colour to represent a rumour about an interactable Hobbit's favourite thing.

""Orlo really likes...""
But then we don't know if it's true and get to have fun testing that out.

It would be nice to be able to write a story, a book on the desk to go and add something to it.

I want to talk to Lily Cotton through the kitchen window, not have to run to the back of the Inn to chat with her.  
I wish you could interact with more people - I get that they have speech bubbles but the cast feels a bit small.  
The camera is wonky af inside places, especially the house.  
Wish there were more hair colors?  
Wish the facial expressions were..more?  
Wish there was a little voice sounds, doesn't have to be talking but some sort of voice sounds.

Over all, TINY problems that I'm complaining about.  Everything else is great, I love that people hangout all over town and the art style is super cute. The quests are not just ""go find this bring it back go find this bring it back"" which I love. AND I LOVE HAVING GUESTS OVER! Get the game!.

— 

Overall, after several hours of play (ps5), I feel like I’m having a lovely, low-stakes experience of living a little hobbit life — the one Frodo would have known and wanted to protect when he went off with the ring. The one he couldn’t truly return to after all he had been through. From that perspective, it’s a lovely gift for a fan :) 

I think this is worth the buy if you’re a lotr fan, and definitely worth the buy if you like cozy games or related life-sim stuff. Just go in knowing it’s the life sim of an average hobbit in the shire, not one of the two-to-five-total hobbits who left to fight dragons or destroy the soul of evil. 

Really, I can’t think of any fictional group better suited to the cozy game genre than hobbits. Their entire existence is silly low-stakes village drama, cheeky little personalities, a love of nature, home, food, crafting, and staying close to your hobbit hole. 

Things I think they did very well outside of the hobbit-y-ness:

1. They got the right details right. I think the physics, lighting, subtle changes in season and flora and fauna that appear, different fish being around at different times of day or different seasons, or certain plants growing better together is all thoughtful cozy game heaven. It’s the right effort in the right places so that even the “cartoony” style fades away into something that feels immersive.

2. Things take “just-enough” work. Fishing takes a little effort, but it’s fun and relatively fast. I’m not sitting waiting 3 minutes do a single dish to bite. You aren’t given nor do you have to make insane amounts of money to decorate your house — you get a little starter set of clothes and a little starter set of home decor options so it actually feels homey, but there’s still incentive to grow.

3. The main metric of forwarding the game is building relationships through hosting meals and I love it. The cooking is probably the most complex thing (in a fun way), but that makes sense for its level of importance in the game.  

4. I feel like a hobbit and this feels like my village. The village is but enough to need some way finding (the birds are cute), but after a while it is small enough that you start to know you way around a bit without being bored — the same way you’d know your way around your own home town. 

5. Most importantly, Weta and crew protected the hobbits. There is (so far) not rings of power horror. The writing, characters, motivations etc. all feel true to a Tolkien-PJ Films idea of a hobbit. Cartoony graphics do not take me out of the world, but a hobbit not being hobbit-y would. Even the dwarf is charming in a dwarf way that made me chuckle and generally every little subtle call-out has made me smile. The hobbits as a whole are really a bit of a caricature of the small idealistic English village inhabitants — so the exaggerated visuals of the game kind of fit for me.

Anyway, happy hobbit-ing :)

Character customization is clunky; it's impossible to make an aesthetically pleasing hobbit.

They move as if they have spinal problems. Why can't they walk more naturally? It's a horrible design decision.

There's no compass to guide you, so it's more chaotic at first; though you get used to it a bit, you miss it.

There are no voices. It's horrible not hearing any voices in a game with NPCs in 2025. It gives you the feeling of an empty world, even though you're surrounded by people.

Performance

You can't eat, you don't need eat. You can only do this as a way of camaraderie, but not because your hobbit is a hungry person. Weird

Pros:

It's a Lord of the Rings game

It looks sooooo much better on your screen than in the videos. You may like the art style more or less graphically (I don't), but in terms of graphics, it looks great.

It's cozy

Conclusion:

I've played it for 1 hour and all I've done is get lost, go from one errand site to another and see nothing but a mechanic that has no depth (from what I've played): cooking.

If they had done basic things like adding voices, allowing the creation of hobbits that aren't aberrant and that walk straight, the game would be passable, but as it is in this state and with these bad decisions, I don't know if I should return it on Steam, and it cost me less than 10 euros.

I'm afraid it'll be a flop and they'll stop supporting it before the end of the year.

Return to Moria, from a smaller studio, does everything right that this game does wrong: it has voices, the world feels alive despite being alone in Moria, the dwarves are very well-crafted and accomplished... There's no excuse for this state, and if I knew they were going to release DLC and support it for years like RtM does, I wouldn't hesitate to keep it. But fearing they'll abandon it, I don't want a half-finished game that that I never touch again.

In terms of glitches, I have not run into any quite yet. It seems to run fairly well on my Acer Nitro 5. I intend to also download the game on my steam deck for some more relaxed gameplay.

All in all, unless you're just running into performance issues, I find this game very cutesy and relaxing. The game is meant to be light-hearted, and I think the style of the game plays into that.

I'm on the fence to buy it still. I very much enjoyed your review, thank you.",4,2025-07-29 17:23:06+00:00,Mixed feelings,"Cons:

Character customization is clunky; it's impossible to make an aesthetically pleasing hobbit.

They move as if they have spinal problems. Why can't they walk more naturally? It's a horrible design decision.

There's no compass to guide you, so it's more chaotic at first; though you get used to it a bit, you miss it.

There are no voices. It's horrible not hearing any voices in a game with NPCs in 2025. It gives you the feeling of an empty world, even though you're surrounded by people.

Performance

You can't eat, you don't need eat. You can only do this as a way of camaraderie, but not because your hobbit is a hungry person. Weird

Pros:

It's a Lord of the Rings game

It looks sooooo much better on your screen than in the videos. You may like the art style more or less graphically (I don't), but in terms of graphics, it looks great.

It's cozy

Conclusion:

I've played it for 1 hour and all I've done is get lost, go from one errand site to another and see nothing but a mechanic that has no depth (from what I've played): cooking.

If they had done basic things like adding voices, allowing the creation of hobbits that aren't aberrant and that walk straight, the game would be passable, but as it is in this state and with these bad decisions, I don't know if I should return it on Steam, and it cost me less than 10 euros.

I'm afraid it'll be a flop and they'll stop supporting it before the end of the year.

Return to Moria, from a smaller studio, does everything right that this game does wrong: it has voices, the world feels alive despite being alone in Moria, the dwarves are very well-crafted and accomplished... There's no excuse for this state, and if I knew they were going to release DLC and support it for years like RtM does, I wouldn't hesitate to keep it. But fearing they'll abandon it, I don't want a half-finished game that that I never touch again.

Never thought I would buy since it's not my type of game, only lotr makes me interested. Saw a clip of tips and tricks on cooking yesterday, thought it looks detailed and could be fun to try. Bought the game right after, played it for 9 hrs straight. Had a great time 😊 I'm so glad I got to play it. It scratched my itch for lotr so well in a cozy, adorable, chill and light hearted way.",1,2025-08-03 00:41:21+00:00,Anyone else decide last minute not to buy it immediately?,I was so excited for this game. I was going to get it on my Switch 2 today. The recent reviews have changed my mind. I'm going to wait and see how the developers respond and see if there game can get better before I buy it.

It could just be it's not a lot of people's cup of tea, but I've found myself enjoying this game faster than I thought.

I set a timer for an hour so if I disliked the game, at least I could return it within the two hour limit Steam gives, but within 30 minutes I was convinced that I am not getting rid of this game at all. It's a light-hearted, cheery little game with playful music, adorable little hobbit characters, and pretty scenery. Yes, it is a lot more cartoon-y than a lot of games, but I think it adds to the whole vibe of the game itself.

I saw IGN critique the cooking feature of this game and read that the author thought that, while it was interesting, it was nuanced. Now I haven't gone as far as cooking on my own, but just from the prompts at the beginning of the game, it's mainly just point and click. I don't find that unappealing in the slighest. While many find the game boring or dull, I believe that's part of why it's labaled as a ""cozy game."" Cozy games are not meant to make you grind for hours, but rather just give you enough gameplay that you can sit and play for an hour while relaxing and then going off to do something else.

Now I did experience a crash, however, I had discord and a browser going on in the background and I left the game unattended, so do with that what you will. In terms of glitches, I have not run into any quite yet. It seems to run fairly well on my Acer Nitro 5. I intend to also download the game on my steam deck for some more relaxed gameplay.

All in all, unless you're just running into performance issues, I find this game very cutesy and relaxing. The game is meant to be light-hearted, and I think the style of the game plays into that. It is 10% off today, and while I was concerned about the lower price at first, do remember steam gives you a little while to play if you decide you want to return the game within the 2 hours.",254,102,"Post: An honest review: everyone's too critical.
