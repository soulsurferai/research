e9308ac8-98ce-4be3-a52c-7fd8ee047f30,1q35tt7,Fantasy,Dalton387,"Not necessarily. I did read HP at the right age. It wasn’t my first fantasy, though. My dad took me to a library book sale and loaded me up with a lot of older fantasy. He filled my basket with Pern, Apprentice Adept, Drizzt, Riftwar Saga, Jurassic Park, and others.

Even after reading for years, I’ve still experienced really cool worlds. I think it’s important to take things for what they are. I don’t read Harry Potter and Complain it’s not Lord of the Rings. I take each for what they are.

So I keep finding new and interesting series and worlds. I found Wheel to Time at one of those sales a few years later. When Jordan passed, I looked up this “new guy” finishing his series. I started Mistborn and was enamored. After so many fantasy series that had a similar feel, he had a totally unique magic system. Swallowing metals to burn power. It was really cool and I still really like how he makes up new and interesting worlds and series.

A few years ago, I got into r/progressionfantasy and I’ve really enjoyed that. A lot of it is rougher than some of the traditionally published fantasy. I actually like that. It’s not hemmed in by rules of what it should be or who will get butt hurt if you do this or that. It’s typically aimed more at adults and you may see more adult themes or language.

Series like Cradle and Dungeon Crawler Carl fall into those categories and while I usually need a break before re-reading my favorite fantasy, I can literally finish these series and start them right over again. Especially the audio versions as both are narrated by goats.

Plenty of other books in there I really like and they’re brand new to me.

Even outside of Fantasy, Red Rising is great.

So I feel I’m still discovering awesome new worlds I can get into.

I almost forgot, but I also got into fantasy comedy. Try Orconomics, Magic 2.0, Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse, etc.",2,2026-01-04 00:53:45+00:00,LOW,2.0,184.41018518518518,Fantasy immersion and age

The Will of the Many actually did it for me as well, though I’ve found it a bit harder to get into The Strength of the Few. 


Also, I find magical realism to do it for me as well. Haruki Murakami does it for me as I love traveling to Japan. Characters are often in that more adult phase of life and the mixture of the magical with the mundane is a bit more captivating for me these days.

Also not fantasy but the Count of Monte Cristo is absolutely perfect.",3,2026-01-03 22:00:53+00:00,LOW,3.0,234.80443287037036,Fantasy immersion and age

e80ea701-b399-4062-9ff1-caa66909c6dd,1jfmei2,weed,Youpunyhumans,"Salvia Divinorum. My brother, my gf at the time and I went to field to try it. My brother went first, and got all weird and wobbly for a few mins, and then when he was coming back to reality, he kept saying ""Im haaaaaaaavvvvving a baaaaaaaaaddd trip!"" But kept saying it over and over, and began laughing too so we didnt know what to do, but he eventually came down and was ok.

Then, it was my turn. I took the hit, and immeditaly was blasted to... somewhere. I remember gravity suddenly feeling extremely strong and coming to this path with 3 options to choose from, none of which I knew what they were, and something behind me was like urging me to choose one. Felt like the scene from LOTR in Moria when Gandalf goes ""I have no memory of this place.""

Then, I started coming back. I could feel I was sweaty and hot, so I tried to take my jacket off to no avail. The zipper was in another dimension then my hands. I tried to ask my brother and gf for help to take it off, but all that I got out was a shaky ""Hhhellllpp!"" Which just freaked them out, which then freaked me out, and then everything turned into eyes all over which was even freakier... and then I came down and cried in my gfs lap for an hour.

She also took it, but after we got home cuz she wanted to be laying on a bed after I explained the uncomfortable gravity. She took the biggest, milkiest bong hit ever... and immeditaly fell over facing away from us. She started shaking, so I went to look at her... and she had almost a literal ear to ear grin, and let out this sound that was like she just discovered laughter, and also heard the funniest joke in the world. She sat up, and looked at this mirror at the end of the hallway, and said ""wtf is that?!"" And started leaning more and more towards it. I grabbed her and pulled her back so she didnt fall over. 

She eventually came bacand described a cube world, with a red cube with arms and legs leading her around and saying stuff like ""thats the blue cube section and the yellow cube section"", but the mirror took the form of cube smashing machine that the red cube was trying to push her into... thus her leaning towards the mirror, and me pulling her back, ""saved"" her from it.",22,2025-03-20 11:42:49+00:00,LOW,5.0,609.4156481481482,What is your scariest high?

Thanks for all of your thoughtful questions!

1) This is a hard one -- especially if you were raised in a family like mine, where the culture was one of scarcity and distrust -- where people were pit against each other. I'm lucky enough to have gone through therapy and group counseling. All of that work helped me realize that I want to live from a place of abundance, where we can cheer people on, even if we were up for the same roles. So many of my friends are asian women (I'm on an all asian femme improv team!) and we often go out for the same roles, and even though it can be hard when one of us gets a role over another, we have learned to celebrate each others' successes as our own. I'm so grateful for them for teaching me that it's possible to celebrate each other.   
2) I would tell you but the list would be way too long haha :)   
3) There's no magic, there's no formula, anyone can do what I do -- just start somewhere and keep going, surround yourself with people you love who are also pursuing the seemingly impossible dream you have, and you'll get there. I'm excited to see the beautiful art you make!  
4) YES, absolutely. At one point I was working 3 part-time jobs all over LA. I was living in Los Feliz. I'd drive to the Palisades to be an assistant at a dental office, then to Santa Monica to work as a office manager at a photography studio, and then I'd drive downtown on weekends to be a food tour guide. It was grueling and I was always exhausted. My friends and I talked about giving up ALL THE TIME. However, it was my friends that got me through and I am forever grateful for my friends (who are still my friends now) for encouraging me during the hard times. Frodo would've never made it to Mordor without Sam, and I wouldn't be here without them.

Then I read Bakker and The Second Apocalypse is now my favourite series. So go with that one and see if it scratches that itch. It's *very* different from the First Law though and closer to Malazan. It is completlely humourless, if that is what you liked with the First Law. You could also try Dune, it's probably the most similar to The Second Apocalypse and available in German (and my book of the year). Do yourself however the favour of reading both arcs, ie the entire 7 book series of the Second Apocalypse. The second arc is thematically quite different from the first one. Where the first one is best described as grimdark, religious byzantine fantasy, the second arc is straight up Lord of the Rings if it were written in the horror genre. There's not much horror in First Law except some of the demon/eater stuff, while Bakker's work is filled to the brim with horror elements.

Otherwise I would have spontaneously also said Malazan, but you said it didn't scratch the itch.

Also as a German myself: do yourself the favour of switching to English.

ab3d6b39-6417-4565-9b4b-344b21c78671,1jcph4n,movies,AgentWD409,"The greatest movie review I've ever read is still this review of *300* from Ain't It Cool News:

&gt;I just saw a movie that’ll give your eyes boners, make your balls scream and make you poop DVD copies of THE TRANSPORTER.  It’s called 300.  I don’t know what the title has to do with the movie, but they could’ve called it KITTENS MAKING CANDLES and it’d still rule.  It’s about these 300 Greek dudes who stomp the sugar-coated shit out of like a million other dudes.  I have a feeling that a lot of high school sports coaches are going to show this film to their teams before they play.  Also, gay dudes and divorced women are going to use screen captures for computer wallpaper.  The movie takes place about a million years ago, and it’s sort of like a prequel to SIN CITY, except way less guns and cars but twice as much skull splitting.  If you watch this movie and go into a Taco Bell, and say to the cashier, “I need some extra sauce packets” guess what?  You’re getting twenty sauce packets because your face will punch him in the brain.  I can’t spoil the plot because THANK GOD THERE ISN’T ONE.  Just ass kicking that kicks ass that, while said ass is getting kicked, is kicking yet more ass that’s hitting someone’s balls with a hammer made of ice but the ice is frozen whiskey.  *TWO COOL THINGS ABOUT THE MOVIE AND ONE THING I DIDN’T LIKE:  COOL THING ONE:  HEAVY METAL DURING BATTLE SCENES*.  Who gives a shit if the music isn’t historically correct?  LORD OF THE RINGS could’ve used some Journey.  This movie has that chu-CHUNG kind of metal that you hear in your head when your shift supervisor at Wetzel’s Pretzel is telling you that you’ll have to stay for clean up and you wish you had a sock filled with quarters in your hand.  *COOL THING TWO:  FOES, MINI-BOSSES AND A BIG BOSS*.  Basically, the Greek dudes are fighting these Persian dudes, but the director, who must have a dick made of three machine guns, does it all like a video game.  The Greeks fight every death metal video from the last ten years.  There’s wave after wave of giants, freaks, ninjas, mutants, wizards, and a hunchback who looks like he’s got Rosie O’Donnell on his back.  Would I have been happy if Dom DeLuise from HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART I had shown up?  Maybe, but this movie more than makes up for that glaring oversight.  *NOT SO GOOD THING:  DUDE NUDITY (“DUDE-ITY”)*.  These are Greek times, when there were a lot of naked women around.  And there are some naked women in this film, but almost every naked woman scene has a muscular dude giving the screen an ass picnic.  Dude-ity is something directors put in their movies so people will think they’re serious, I guess, and not just throwing in naked hotties.  Any directors reading this – IT’S OKAY TO JUST THROW IN NAKED HOTTIES.  Can’t someone make a movie about naked Amazons and call it PAUSE BUTTON?  My final analysis is 300 the most ass-ruling movie I’ve seen this year, and will probably be the King of 2007 unless someone makes a movie where a pair of sentient boobs fights a werewolf.",12,2025-03-17 02:29:43+00:00,LOW,2.0,69.61944444444444,What's the funniest review you have ever read of a movie?

**PRE-GREEK STUFF** (Not too long, all by anonymous authors, still interesting. All of this has only been rediscovered over the last 200 years, which is why you don't see them referenced throughout most of literary history)

The Epic of Gilgamesh

The Enuma Elish

The Atrahasis

The Descent of Inanna into the Underworld

**CLASSIC EPICS** (Only a few survive today. Even as influential as Greek Mythology is, 90% of what was written was LOST.)

The Iliad and The Odyssey, by Homer. (I know you said no Iliad but I am listing it for posterity hahahha. These were both the oldest AND LONGEST works of Greek literature, which is WHY they are so influential)

The Theogony by Hesiod

The Argonautica by Apollonius of Rhodes

The Aeneid by Virgil

The Metamorphoses by Ovid

The Alexander Romance

**INDIAN EPICS** (one is long, and the other is basically the longest thing ever written people lmao)

The Ramayana by Vyasa (More classically fantasy)

The Mahabharata (longer than everything else on this list combined . Includes one of Hinduism's most sacred text, the Bhagavad Gita, as a single chapter of the larger story.)

**CHINESE EPICS** (All of these are long enough to rival any modern fantasy series)

Investiture of the Gods (battles between gods and demons)

Journey to the West (Sun Wu-Kong and his friends travelling west. Lots of episodic adventures, not really that similar to Dragon Ball.)

Romance of the Three Kingdoms (historical epic with the lightest of fantasy elements, as influential to Asian culture as Iliad is to Western culture, has the coolest battles ever)

Outlaws of the Marsh (another lengthy lightly supernatural war epic but about 108 criminal anti-heroes each with their own backstories and power sets.

**MEDIEVAL EPICS** This is where the sort of fantasy you're asking for originates- for the most part, when medieval authors wanted to write fantasy they put it ""in continuity"" with either Charlemagne, King Arthur, or Alexander the Great. So these sets of legends grew and grew over hundreds of years as more people added to the pot and remixed what came before.

Beowulf (one of the only works to survive from the early medieval period, aka the ""dark ages"")

The Song of Roland (kickstarts the Matter of France, the ""Charlemagne"" continuity. Coolest last stand ever, very influential on Lord of the Rings and the Dark Tower)

History of the Kings of Britain by Geoffrey of Monmouth (kickstarts the Matter of Britain, the ""King Arthur"" continuity.)

The Romances of Chretien de Troyes (he wrote a lot of the early versions of King Arthur's different knights)

The Mabinogion (the compendium of Welsh Mythology, really weird and cool and violent with a couple of early King Arthur stories too.)

The Ulster cycle (AKA the Tain, one of the most influential sets of Irish myths including ""The Cattle Raid of Cooley)

The Song of the Nibelungs (Grandfather of Lord of the Rings)

The Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda (Where we get 90% of Norse mythology today)

The Song of El Cid - (Spain's greatest epic)

**RENAISSANCE EPICS**

Le Morte D'Arthur by Thomas Malory (The first complete cycle of King Arthur stories in English. Most modern adaptations will be more or less based off of this set of stories.

Orlando Innamorato by Matteo Boiardo (Prequel to the Song of Roland, influential but never finished)

Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Arioso (sequel to Orlando Innamorato, considered for centuries to be THE GREATEST work of fantasy ever written. Hundreds of pages, has a huge cast with interweaving plotlines just like a modern fantasy epic, which was very revolutionary at the time.)

Jerusalem Delivered by Torquato Tasso (like Orlando Furioso but about the Crusades, considered the other pinnacle of Italian epic literature)

Paradise Lost by John Milton (biblical epic written more in the style of Homer and Virgil than of all the other stuff here)

The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser (the best work of English fantasy since Beowulf, he only completed one fourth of it and it was still the longest fantasy ever written in the English language until, like, Lord of the Rings.

Don Quixote by Miguel Cervantes (a BRUTAL PARODY of all the books from the last two sections, which ends up inventing modern literature along the way.

**ROMANTIC EPICS** (The rise of romanticism and nationalism in the early 1800's saw an attempt to write or rediscover fantasy poetry)

The Kalevala (the newly-arranged compendium of Finnish mythology, very influential on Tolkien)

The Poems of Ossian by James MacPherson (Supposedly a rediscovered set of Scottish mythology like the Kalevala or Mabinogion but it was all a hoax- written by a single guy. That arguably makes it more interesting)

The Idylls of the King by Lord Tennyson (set of poems about King Arthur, most essential King Athur retelling between the renaissance and Pre-Tolkien periods)

**PRE-TOLKIEN EPICS** (Prose fantasy in the 1600's, 1700s, early 1800's tended towards fairy tales or gothic literature or other forms of fantasy that don't really fall into the ""epic."" Epic fantasy as we know it is caused by people starting to look back and write in the style of the Medieval and Renaissance epics.

Anything by William Morris (I haven't done a deep dive so I don't know his best to recommend, but he was the biggest inspiration to Lewis and Tolkien in terms of writing ""epics"" in the modern day. He was the first author to write fantasy in an invented world too.

The Worm Ouroboros and the Zimiamvian Trilogy of E.R. Eddison

A Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs (what if fantasy took place IN SPACE)

The Night Land by William Hope Hodgson (Weird Dark Souls-y fantasy about fighting demons in the far future with a chainsaw gun.)

The Gods of Pegana by Lord Dunsany (first attempt to do a Silmarillion-style compendium of invented mythology, but very funny)

The King of Elfland's Daughter by Lord Dunsany (the best prose ever written, easy. Dunsany also has a ton of other great Fantasy but these two works are best representative of his style)

The Mabinogion by Evageline Walton (modern day remake of Welsh mythology, started decades before Tolkien but not fully published until the seventies. My FAVORITE of everything on this list.)

The Tale of King Arthur and his Knights by Howard Pyle

The Once and Future King by TH White (these are probably the two best modern, pre-Tolkien King Arthur adaptations)

Gormenghast Trilogy by Mervyn Peake (insane prose and mood and worldbuilding, not much in the way of action)

Silverlock by John Myers Myers

The Well of the Unicorn by Fletcher Pratt

The Tritonian Ring by L Sprague de Camp

Conan by Robert E Howard

Anything written by Clark Ashton Smith

The Broken Sword by Poul Anderson (The KING of Grimdark fantasy, published the same year as Lord of the Rings)

It has been quite a week for family drama, but I fly back home from my parents’ tomorrow. I had decided to stay for two weeks this holiday season, and while it was nice to see everyone and catch up, I’m very ready to go home now. 



I read 4 books while on this trip: The Horse and His Boy and The Magician’s Nephew, both by CS Lewis; The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde; and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight / Pearl / Sir Orfeo, trans by JRR Tolkien. My first book of the year is Reaper Man by Terry Pratchett.



Finished the year with 69 books. I had originally set my goal for 2025 at 45 books, because my main goal for the year was to read more critically and carefully, and I figured that would involve spending more time with books. I also planned to read more history nonfiction, which tend to be longer. Despite a personal record number of reads, I do feel like I succeeded in the first goal. At the beginning of the year I kept a physical journal where I made notes and analyses of what I read. Eventually that morphed into a google doc, which I reference when I write my reviews for Review Tuesdays. Turns out, once you have some practice with critical thinking, it comes easier, and you don’t have to slow down your reading for it. 



I did only read 3 history books though, so that goal is carrying over into 2026. 



My main goal for 2026 is to diversify my reading. I’d like to do the 2026 bingo card without using any white male authors. I’d also like to diversify my genre taste though, so once I get home and until Bingo starts, I’m going to catch up on all my non-SFF books I own. I have a good number of classics and lit-fic I’d like to read. This means y’all will see less of me in the Tuesday threads once I finish Reaper Man, but I’ll still keep you abreast of my adventures on Fridays.

It is a fun time to think about goals though and I *love* making up goals for myself (and then not ever worrying about actually completing them). Objectively, I am in a better place than I was a year ago, and I hope to be in an even better place this time next year.

My goal for reading is 52 books this year, even though I didn't meet the 26 I set as my goal last year. Go big or go home, am I right? There's no telling how it'll go and I don't feel bad about it if I don't meet the goal anyway, so 52 is a nice number.

I also have the goal of getting through my yarn stash. Based on the size, it shouldn't be too hard... except for my sock yarns. I used to be a huge sock knitter, but I had a few flops and that's thrown me off for the last few years. I've realized I actually can listen to audiobooks and pay attention as long as I'm knitting, so that should help!

Piranesi - loved the setting, hated the plot

Shadow of the Gods trilogy - really underwhelmed. Too combat focused for me

Scholomance Trilogy - Some of this was great, but it was sooo ""look how edgy I am!!!"" and the big reveals at the end of the trilogy fell so flat imo

Tess of the d'Urbervilles - not fantasy, and very tedious, my first classic novel. Like it, don't think it'll fall on a favorites list

Colleen the Wanderer - first self pub book I've ever read. A lot of really creative worldbuilding, and a lot of wandering, which I love

The Bone Harp - Part 1 was great! Part 2 was perhaps the worst thing I've ever read. finished this one out of spite

The Spear Cuts Through Water - narrative style made this one really hard to enjoy

Cradle series - great palate cleanser. I am unfortunately a sucker for training and tournament arcs, and this is basically a 12 book long training arc

The Library at Mt. Char - Was my only 5 star rating for most of the year, definitely recommend this one

The Hobbit - first time reading this, and first Tolkien. I get why people like it

The Sword of Kaigen - 2nd self pub I read. Another victim of a great 1st half with a disappointing back half

Think of it like this: There’s Grimdark, Nobledark, Grimbright, and Noblebright. Not to be condescending, I just feel like getting my thoughts out.

Grimdark is bad world + bad/morally dubious characters. Generally pretty violent and hopeless, with a “grim” outlook on morality and the future of its world. The First Law is a good example of this style. A world where power is all that matters and that will not change for the better, or at least not quickly, where characters usually are either bad from the start, get worse over the course of their story, are unable to achieve true development from their flaws, or are punished for being good. Spoilers. &gt;!Glokta doesn’t even try to become better and simply finds himself working under a new tyrant master in the end, Logen is incapable of escaping his violent inner self and literally ends the story the way he started in getting kicked out of The North, Ferro remains an asshole and returns to her suicidal revenge quest, West gets fantasy radiation poisoning and dies horribly, and Jezal  seems to become a genuinely down to earth and heroic person but is ultimately left trapped under Bayaz’s thumb and too cowardly to do anything against him.!&lt;

Nobledark is bad world + noble or good characters. Think Lord of the Rings, or lots of Sanderson’s work. Hot take: &gt;!I think A Song of Ice and Fire kinda fits more here than in Grimdark. Maybe 60/40.!&lt; This is where I think TLT fits most comfortably. The world has some horrible things going on in it. Genocide, religious fanaticism, New Zealand English, entire planets being killed, terrorism, imperialism, lots of death. But many of the characters are good. Gideon is selfless and forgiving, Cam and Pal are decent, caring, and deeply value the truth, Nona is the purest bean, etc. Nothing in the series has led me to believe that things won’t get better as a result of their efforts. One of the major themes of the series is love, after all. 

Grimbright is weird. Good world + bad characters. Basically a place that’s nice to look at, but don’t scratch the surface or you’ll see all the horribleness underneath. Maybe The Boys tv show is a good example? 

Noblebright is happy fun land. There may be evil challenges, but our heroes will save the day heroically and go back to living in a peaceful and pretty world. Think King Arthur or Zelda.",9,2026-01-02 04:45:45+00:00,LOW,1.0,31.02755787037037,Happy 2026! Could I get some grimdark written by women??

Like Tolkien, Wolfe is also a lover of language, only instead of exploring grammatical constructions he was more a lover of esoteric vocabulary, for example the name of the northern foes of Severian's country, the Ascians. 

&gt;Asian: it means 'dweller of the tropics', and it came into English by way of medieval Latin as an adaptation of ancient Greek ἄσκιος, literally 'without a shadow'.

The Book of the New Sun is absolutely chock-full of terms like this. You might think that this makes the book difficult to read and it is, but not for that reason, the words in context are pretty easy to basically understand. 

However, the difficulty lies in the fact that Severian is probably the greatest unreliable narrator of all time, further complicated by the fact that he claims at have an eidetic memory. A liar (maybe) who never forgets is a formidable obfuscation. 

The nature of the story isn't exactly helping either since Severian's journey may have been prompted by inhumane intelligences that are suitably ineffable because they are stand-ins for the angels and deity of Wolfe's staunch Catholic faith.

The two that come to mind immediately for me are scifi. Dune has suffered that effect from multiple different directors now. And also nearly every adaptation of Philip K. Dick's works, particularly the resulting Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049, even though PKD made it specifically clear that Deckard was meant to be human, not a replicant. The result is good when viewed on its own; but it can never rise to the level of the author's imagination because a lesser writer, i.e. director/screenwriter, imposes their own story into the mix

In fantasy, the big one is Lord of the Rings. There are changes necessary because internal character thoughts and motivations, narrative and exposition in a novel don't work well one screen; and then there are whims of directors which are not necessary.",0,2026-01-01 21:02:17+00:00,LOW,1.0,32.57131944444444,What fantasy book or series would you like turned into a game or movie?

Why does someone skip a prologue? Why is a prologue not just chapter 1? What is the difference between a prologue and a chapter? In all of these questions my answer has obviously been ""Don't read books, don't get invested in characters, don't enjoy prose, don't get immersed."" Bruh.


Of course we read to get immersed, to get invested on an emotional level to characters who can be more real than real people we meet in our day to day lives. I've never been arguing against that.

1) Tolkien. Great prose. A bit slow which won't discourage someone who enjoys Proust. Lots of literary connections with classical literature. And of course, basically the father of the genre. His psychological analysis is not his best suit - you'll get memorable and inspiring characters rather than troubled and complex (more like Hugo than Dostojevski).


2) Ursula Le Guin. I've only read her earth sea series, which has basically all the same strengths than I described for Tolkien. 


3) At the boundary between fantasy and literary fiction, you have a lot of authors that write fantasy but in the style of literary fiction. My favourite examples are Julien Gracq (the Opposing Shore, the best prose in the French literature), Ernst Junger (On the Marble Cliffs, great prose, blood curling villain), Garcia Marquez, Borges (those two would be magical realism I guess). 


4) Piranesi by Susan Clarke is also pretty amazing, very Borgesian I think. ",9,2025-12-31 18:26:09+00:00,LOW,3.0,312.5313425925926,"Fantasy book for an ""elitist"" reader?"

* The ***Poetic Edda*** and ***Prose Edda***, Icelandic collections of mythological and heroic poems.

I was born in the 80's.  Every decade since has seemed like a slap in the face.  More and more terrible human decisions leading to faster changes and bigger catastrophes that fall like dominos. 


But this decade so far? Wow. It knocks out any tangible memory of what a ""normal"" time felt like. It feels like each and every day I am trudging through the dark world to bring the one ring to Mordor. The only problem is that there is no fix. No ring to toss to set things right. So it's all the trudging with no end in sight. Doomed to trudge until an orc (unprecedented event) gets me.

Disinformation or lack of information is *itself* informative. Indeed, the more sharply one person takes all information for themselves for self-enrichment, the sharper the shadow comes into focus for the many others they leave behind and implicates the thief's identity and motive.

**The Magician’s Nephew** - CS Lewis. Narnia has found its footing again! After a bit of a slog through Silver Chair and The Horse and His Boy, The Magician’s Nephew stands out as something remarkable.

Diggory is a compelling enough protagonist, flawed but loyal and trying to do good. His Uncle Andrew is truly despicable, and Diggory is smart enough to recognize him as such. The horse Strawberry/Fledge is also a highlight.

But of course where Lewis always shines is with Aslan, who appears roughly halfway through the book, as our crew accidentally stumble into Narnia as it's being sung into existence by our favorite God-Lion. The way Lewis describes the creation is utterly enchanting. He is countered by Jadis, the beautiful but cruel queen who has already destroyed one world and is seeking to rule another. Even though Aslan created Narnia, he immediately gives it away to someone else to rule. 

Currently reading Oscar Wilde’s **The Picture of Dorian Gray**, which I hope to finish today, though it’s a bit challenging for my holiday-brain right now. There’s a lot of stuff about aesthetics and art that I don’t really get all the details of, but understand the gist of what they’re saying. Chapter 11 was filled with ultra-long paragraphs about musical instruments, jewels, textile and embroidery, etc that I didn’t understand why they were being harped on for so many pages, until I realized it was making a bunch of allusions to things I was unfamiliar with, so I’ll definitely need to look up further analysis when I get out of my parents’ house. The gist, I think, is that Dorian is being compared to historical figures known for their excesses or cruelty, with a bit of homosexuality thrown in there

While I enjoyed Wilde’s witticisms in The Importance of Being Earnest, they start to grate on me at novel-length. I’m confident that Lord Henry is meant to be an unlikeable character, someone who makes arguments they don’t believe and may not really believe in anything, and who is a bad influence on Dorian. I feel like Basil, practically begging Dorian not to listen to Henry. I also can’t help but think the three of them are reflections of Wilde’s own relationships, Henry as Lord Alfred Douglass and Basil as Robbie Ross.

1. You don't know what is possible until you try. Fixing a problem requires commitment to keep trying until something works, and to keep trying even when the odds are against you.

That wouldn't have been much of a story if they had preached acceptance. What they did is form a plan that had close to zero chance of succeeding, and commit their lives to the attempt regardless of the personal cost and insurmountable obstacles. The two characters in the LotR who did preach acceptance, Saruman and Denethor, were evil and foolish. If you read/watch LotR and come away thinking it's about acceptance, you've got it backwards.
2. Part of making the most out of the time we have is focusing on the big problems and trying to do something about them. What more meaningful thing is there to do in life?

My month of fantasy-reading was one of hearty classics, starting with the tail end of an autumnal Tolkien reread and concluding with a journey deep(er) into the work of Susan Cooper.

***The Return of the King*** **by J. R. R. Tolkien**

This past autumn I'd embarked on a long-expected reread of *The Lord of the Rings*, and I was still somewhere in the midst of the third volume at the start of December. This was a joy, obviously, and it was utterly heartbreaking to let go at the end.

One enjoyable aspect particular to *The Return of the King* is re-experiencing the bits of the ending the Peter Jackson adaptation left out: not just the Scouring of the Shire, but also the Field of Cormallen, Ioreth, the last visit to Edoras, and plenty of other book-only scenes. I understand why they didn't make it into the film (people already complain about it having 'too many endings'), but it also makes for an extra layer of book–film distinction that keeps things refreshing.

***Over Sea, Under Stone*** **by Susan Cooper**

This too was a reread; I read *Over Sea, Under Stone* at some point as a child and absolutely adored it. It was very much how I remembered it, with its incredibly vivid Cornish setting and wonderfully adventurous tone.

This time I also found myself enamoured with the prose itself. Cooper's writing is poetic and beautiful and yet goes easily unnoticed in the reading experience; it's so elegant and clear and successful in evoking the desired imagery that the sentences melt away and you find yourself standing atop the headlands of Trewissick.

One purpose of this reread (aside from getting to enjoy the book all over again) was to launch myself into the full sequence of *The Dark is Rising* for the first time, and that plan has come to fruition.

***The Wood at Midwinter*** **by Susanna Clarke**

But first, a *very* brief interlude to leap from one great ""SC"" of fantasy to another.

Back in December 2024, I had bought *The Wood at Midwinter* by Susanna Clarke, intending to read it at the eponymous time. I remember greatly enjoying *Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell* as a teenager and developing an obsession with *Piranesi* a few years ago, so there's little hesitation in grabbing whatever Clarke has written lately.

Somehow, though, *The Wood at Midwinter* slipped my mind at the appropriate time a year ago, and by the time I'd remembered I had it, midwinter was long past. And yes, of course, I could've just read it anyway, but I could see from the (very) small volume that it was a short and heavily-illustrated work that was definitely seasonally-focused, and I decided to wait until the following winter. And so, between Midwinter's Day and Christmas Day of 2025, I remembered it all of a sudden, and ended up reading it on Christmas Eve.

I knew it would be short, but I didn't realise quite *how* short. It was over in one sitting, and in a short sitting at that, but it was steeped in the magic typical to Clarke's work, and I liked it. It's one I might return to during winters yet to come, especially because it's so short and seasonally atmospheric that it works as an quick Christmas treat.

***The Dark is Rising*** **by Susan Cooper**

There's a brief personal story to be told here. After loving *Over Sea, Under Stone* as a child, I flew to the next book expecting to return to the same characters and setting, but the opening of *The Dark is Rising* felt so jarring with its new imagery and (initial) cast that I simply never continued. I expect there were external circumstances that exacerbated my lack of determination, but for whatever reason, I must've been at most a couple of pages into the first chapter when I dropped it and never returned to it.

Since then, I've learnt more about how the sequence was written—with *Over Sea, Under Stone* as an original standalone that was extended into a series eight years later—and also, naturally, I'm no longer a child who dismisses a book because he doesn't know where his familiar characters have gone!

Reading this during the Christmas season was magical and incredibly fitting, and I am so glad I've finally returned to give these books a proper chance. As with *The Wood at Midwinter*, the timing was intentional; I believe at some point I'd seen a recommendation about reading this one at Christmas, and it paid off. In fact, in early January, the day after I'd finished *The Dark is Rising* (the particular installment after which the series is named, not the series as a whole), we had a lot of snow here in my rural English village, and there was even concern we might get snowed into another more quintessential rural English village that we'd visited to see family, which felt like a strange blending of fiction and reality after the events of the book.

All in all, this was a deeply enchanting read, full of that unique spirit of classic children's fantasy. Since then I've advanced with the series and I'm still loving it, but I shall leave that for a January catchup.

**The Bone Harp by Victoria Goddard** There's a lot to like about this, especially with the characterization of Tamsin in the first section of the book. The gradual reveal of his history and notoriety was very cool! I have a lot of gripes with the writing though. I see what she's trying to do with kind of an experimental style, but it is not working for me. Even in the first part of the book, there was a lot of repetition and gratuitous italics (and you may be able to tell from this comment that I don't have an issue with an occasional italicized word), but the second section's attempt at some kind of fairy-tale style worked even less for me. I've gotten through the second section of the book, with &gt;!Klara's POV!&lt; and I'm relieved to be done with that and return to Tamsin. It's also pretty apparent this was at least inspired by a Silmarillion fanfic, which isn't necessarily a problem, but I do think partially my familiarity with the quirks of fanfic writing (as somebody who has both written and read plenty of it) tipped me off, because I haven't actually read The Silmarillion yet. This will be my *Hidden Gem* bingo book.

**The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien** What, I wanted to see who Tamsin was supposed to be in the original, can you blame me? I'm really liking it. It's going to take me a while, but it's not *hard*, like a lot of people say, it's just a bit dense and slow paced. I saw someone say that if LOTR is basic multiplication, then The Silmarillion is advanced particle physics lmao, but I'm not so sure about that. I certainly feel a bit silly for avoiding it for 20 years. This bingo turned out surprisingly elf-y for me! But I'm actually going to use it as my *Recycle a Bingo Square* book, using the *Published Before Your Birth* square from 2018. HM because it was published more than 10 years before I was born.

**Noor by Nnedi Okorafor** I didn't like Akata Witch, but this one is so much better so far. The metaphor of AO's life and the fear and disgust with which people treat her is such a good metaphor for women who refuse to confirm to beauty standards, disabled people who refuse to be ashamed of their bodies and lives, and trans and gender nonconforming people who choose to take control of their bodies and gender expression to better reflect their identity. I don't really know where the plot is going, but I'm very intrigued. I also *loved* how &gt;!the attack in the market!&lt; was written. It felt like I was experiencing it and not quite realizing what was happening until it had already started. So far I'm not sure if this works for anything else besides *Author of Color* which is a bit of a bummer because Natural Beauty by Ling Ling Huang is HM for that and also might not fit other squares. It would be nice if I discovered it fit one of my other remaining squares, but I might have to use my non-Recycle replacement square on it. 


Playing

**Blue Prince** Very cool ambience, great cut scenes... those are the nice things I can say about it. I understand why some people say this game doesn't respect your time now. It feels like it pads the amount of time it takes to do everything to trick you into thinking it's smarter than it actually is (and yes I know what happens after &gt;!you reach room 46!&lt; and I don't think it makes up for it). I love puzzle games and I love roguelites, but this was like all my least favorite things about both those genres.

I prefer knowledge puzzle games like **The Roottrees Are Dead**, which isn't speculative at all, but was very fun! It wasn't quite as mind blowing as Return of the Obra Dinn (hey, if anyone wants a rec for the Not A Book bingo square, play that), but it had that same feeling. I thought the main story was quite fun and the expanded part was harder for me, but I have to admit that may have been because I got 4 hours of sleep yesterday when I was playing it.

I'm not sure what I'll play next because I keep getting the feeling that I don't want to sink an unknown amount of time into a game, but you know what that means: spreadsheet time. This is the perfect thing to do while spending time off from my job as a data analyst!

But the short answer is: in the 1970s, D&amp;D mashed together a lot of fantasy tropes into one universe, and later authors received that as the ""standard"" fantasy package: elves, dwarves, orcs, wizards and clerics, adventurers and dragon hoards, etc.

D&amp;D, in turn, drew on a bunch of sources.  The obvious ones are Tolkien (orcs, elves, dwarves, dragons, wizards, magic rings), King Arthur (chosen ones, knights and quests, itinerant adventurers), Conan the Barbarian &amp; Fritz Leiber (barbarians, thieves), and the Song of Roland (paladins, clerics).

If you check D&amp;D's ""Appendix N"" you'll get referenced to a lot of those early inspirations.

&gt; Without a shadow of a doubt, the first fiction ever recounted was fantasy. Guys sitting around the campfire— Was it you who wrote the review? I thought I recognized it— Guys sitting around the campfire telling each other stories about the gods who made lightning, and stuff like that.

Obviously, over the years authors used prior stories and added to them to tell their own stories. [King Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur) is an example of this with multiple retellings of this over the centuries from Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century and Thomas Malory in the 15th century to Alfred Tennyson in the 19th century.

Obviously, J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Fritz Leiber, Bram Stoker, Michael Moorcock and others have all contributed to the tropes of modern fantasy too.

Dungeons &amp; Dragons is perhaps responsible for pulling many influences together to produce a set of standard tropes that many authors subsequently (unconsciously?) adhere to as well.

You can really tell when my slump started by doing the month breakdown.

January: The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien- I figured it was time to read the books after obsessing over the movies for years to the point where I have a dog named Frodo. It did not disappoint.

February: Mars volume 1- I didn’t think I would like this especially with the old art style but it was just so good. It’s now one of my favourite manga series ever. I’m so happy it’s getting a new release next year so I can collect it.

March: Mars volumes 2-15 - I had a lot of 5 stars this month so I went with the series that had the most as I couldn’t narrow it down.

April: Mr. Villains Day Off volume 6- this was my only 5 star this month. Great pallet cleanser series.

May: Halo The Fall of Reach by Eric Nylund- grew up on the games and finally got around to reading the books. If you count re-reads it would have been one of the Murderbot Diaries books between 2-4.

June: Sorcery and Small Magics by Maiga Doocy- not for everyone but personally I loved it to the point where I immediately wanted to re-read it.

July: Zom100 volume 11- I gave this three stars but it’s my highest rated book for the month. Overall an okay series some volumes are better than others.

August: Zom100 volume 13- again highest rated but this was a 4 star volume this time.

September: Zom100 volume 17- highest rated at 3.5 stars.

October: Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman- I had some minor issues with it but enjoyed it enough that I want to own a copy and continue the series. And controversial opinion I felt like the audiobook was just okay.

November: The Last Olympian by Rick Riordan- finally got around to reading this series and thoroughly enjoyed it.

December: haven’t finished anything this month yet.

Man, that much Robin Hobb sounds like a reading year for sure!

JANUARY: The Reformatory by Tananarive Due. I can't say anything that hasn't been said, so I will leave you to discover this one. Powerful stuff.

FEBRUARY: The House of Isador/Their Vampire Queen by Joely Sue Burkhart: Erotica from go to whoa. Yeah, that's all. Plus devoted MMCs. As a first intro to RH they are incredible. Love the way the guys worshipped the FMC in House of Isador. Also enjoyed the progression of her powers.

MARCH: Ghost Alphas Unit series by Lenore Rosewood. I would've liked more of an actual dystopia, worldbuilding-wise, and the plot took a contrived turn, but all in all I enjoyed the group dynamics. Nothing groundbreaking, and if I'd rated it ""objectively"" it would've been a 3. But still, it was just a solid read for me. Ticked all my boxes. 

APRIL: 

1. The Changeling Sea by Patricia McKillip - Lyrical and beautiful, exactly the dreamy fairytale feel I look for from a fantasy. I am not huge on retellings - but this wasn't one. It was sublime, poetic. My first McKillip and it certainly won't be my last.

2.  Network Effect by Martha Wells  - come on, what's not to love? Our favourite sarcastic Sec Unit goes on another mission. The shimmers of body horror throughout really elevated Network Effect for this horror fan. I know it's Sci-Fi but I'd welcome more in this vein.

MAY, DECEMBER: Feral Alphas. I adored the way the MMCs took care of the FMCs (and each other) and I am majorly into Omegas being rescued. There was such beautiful character development and I was smiling like an idiot when they all got their HEA. I really didn't want the series to end! One of my top romance series ever.

JULY: The Broken Sword by Poul Anderson. Highly recommended to LotR and Silm fans. It has everything LotR has, and with the same exceptional writing.

AUGUST: Way too many, but I'll put Adulthood Rites, like you. 

SEPTEMBER: The Unworthy by Agustina Bazterrica. This had a lot of things I love - diary format, a properly eerie post-apoc atmosphere, just generally unsettling vibes all around. It's hard to explain the actual plot because Bazterrica and her translator create such menace through the FMC's perceptions/impressions. 

OCTOBER: A Bone in His Teeth by Kellen Graves.

I adore merpeople and this delivered. Though it didn't quite hit the emotional beats for me,  horror-wise, there is a fair bit of gore and some beautiful descriptions of the merrows. Of course I won't say it's a 'real' horror book, but more of dark fantasy romance. It reminded me of House of Salt and Sorrows, for obvious reasons. It instantly transported me to the setting.

NOVEMBER: 

1. Betrothed to the Emperor by Kai Butler - This was out of my comfort zone as I don't tend to read much fantasy and this was quite political fantasy for my tastes. It was full of court intrigue. I'll be honest, I mainly enjoyed it because there were similarities to ATLA. I'm not accusing the author of plagiarism, for the record, but I could see clear inspiration from ATLA. The magic was very animal/nature/element based, but not in the same way that I dislike in so many talking animal books, such as The Immortals Quartet by Tamora Pierce. I really enjoyed the balance of political intrigue and romance, especially the vulnerability and emotional moments between the main characters as they got to know one another.

2. Flowerheart by Catherine Bakewell. Honestly, this was more of a ""this hit the spot"" kind of a book for me. Female heroine, magic, YA, sweetness and romance. It was very classic fantasy, for lack of a better word. If you're not into that you might find it a bit underwhelming. But highly recommended for Tamora Pierce fans - the descriptions of the flowers reminded me a lot of  Tempests and Slaughter (and the Emelan four, of course). And just generally, I love my fantasy books with a hefty dose of sensory details and I adore a good magical misfit story.",3,2025-12-29 23:59:45+00:00,LOW,7.0,322.7068634259259,What Are Your Favorite Reads of 2025? - Can You Narrow it Down to Your Top Read of Each Month?

a5b94473-da89-4ddd-97b3-416b83565a3c,1py5b53,Fantasy,NorinBlade,"No. In my opinion Northern Lights is a better implementation of the world. It has one of the best opening chapters in all of fiction, and never lets up. I have rarely, maybe never, seen such distinct and compelling introductions of an ensemble cast. Particularly Lyra, Pantalaimon, Lord Asriel, Lee Scorsby, Miss Coulter, Farder Coram, Iorek Byrnison... the list is long, and each character is exceptionally well crafted. Each character has their own stakes, deftly rendered, which leads to believable conflict.

There is a reason why Northern Lights topped the list of all time Carnegie Medal winners to earn the title ""Carnegie of Carnegies."" It's as close to a flawless fantasy novel as I've ever seen. The scene with Tony Makarios in the fishing cabin alone gives me goosebumps, particularly when you re-read the scene and see how few words Pullman used to generate such heartbreaking sympathy for a side character. The tension he creates in each scene owes a debt to each preceding scene.

The Subtle Knife creates a fantastic introduction of Will. We get to follow him in tight POV in a completely different world (our own.) Lyra's interactions with that world are really engaging and tense. But in comparison to Northern Lights (leaning away from spoilers here), I find the pacing inconsistent, and some of the subplots bloated. This is because Pullman is weaving in an agenda, and he sacrifices some of the plot integrity and characterization to get that agenda baked in.

Those chickens really come home to roost in The Amber Spyglass. Although I am an atheist, and I appreciate Pullman's unapologetic deconstruction of organized religion, it becomes obvious he is grinding an axe. I liked it better in Northern Lights when the axe had not yet been swung.

That all said, I view His Dark Materials as one story, kind of like Lord of the Rings. It's one of the best fantasy trilogies of all time.",12,2025-12-29 01:06:20+00:00,LOW,4.0,226.9243287037037,Subtle Knife better than Golden Compass?

2. If you froze our current tech - right where it is - we would likely get to collapse sometime in the 30's.  My guess, mid to late 30's.  That said, collapse is like economics.  When your neighbor loses their job and can't find a new one, that's a recession. When it happens to you, that's a depression.  So poorer, more fragile countries will continue to down-spiral into failed states.  Some, better run countries with hard to defend borders, will succumb to invasion.  

But our tech isn't frozen, quite the opposite. There are a set of relevant technological races that are all going on in parallel.  IMHO the most important race by far has to do with genetically hardening the plants that supply the majority of our food.  In the Mekong delta, that means making rice that is resistant to increasing salinity caused by rising seas.  In other places, resistance to raw heat, increased pests, reduced water, etc.  Sadly, the US continues to believe that our greatest threats are other humans. This is why we spend 1.5 Trillion/year on defense, and a tiny, tiny fraction of that on crop engineering.  We ""might"" also slow warming thru geoengineering though, we will likely find Chemogeddon little better than Thermageddon.  

The US may not seriously unravel economically until the 2040s, if our Agricultural engineers find ways to maintain our farm yields. The big unknown is the nuclear question.  Ironically, in the Lord of the Rings there are 9 Nazgul.  And in the modern world there are 9 nuclear states.  That's the biggest wildcard, followed by rogue states employing geoengineering in a way that adversely effects sunlight/crop yields.  

But your GF is right. By 2040, there will be at least a billion fewer humans, maybe multiple billions less than there are today.  Many of them from countries that contributed very little to our total GHG footprint.  Totally unfair.  Pretty close to a certainty at this point.

Over time I've realised that the really intricate and interesting details are within the normal people characterisation not because they're ""relatable"" but because they aren't. Fiction is a way to experience people similar to us going through imaginary situations as what I believe is a kind of psychological preparation for uncommon situations like dreams are. 

Villains and antagonists live and die based on mystery. If you spend all your time following them they become demystified and don't carry the same aura that's the exact thing drawing you in. I suspect some stories could do with a little more villain design going on in the background than ""this is evilman mckillem'all he wants to do a bad"" and this could be delivered, but plenty of authors struggle with audiences who're incapable of separating fiction from reality and either relating too hard with the villain or thinking the author approves of the villain's actions because they devote more time to explaining them.",166,2025-12-29 13:54:10+00:00,MEDIUM,3.0,60.946412037037035,"That excitement when the prologue is about a badass villain or other cool mysterious character, and then the disappointment when the book cuts away and we are stuck following some ""relatable"" schmuck for the next 100 pages..."

b590752e-d188-4533-b98e-1c27f297c8ae,1pym2kq,Fantasy,Marcuse0,"Pretty much any example of villain decay does this. The more we know a character and can explain and understand their abilities, the less it makes sense that they can be beaten, or that they did what they can do in the first place. 

Take the Night King from the tv show Game of Thrones (specifically not the book, as there is no leader for the Others in the book we've seen). Initially he's running about doing anything he wants, and the protagonists know next to nothing about him and he's more or less free, from a writing perspective, to do whatever he wants. But after a while when we learn what he is and what can harm him, he becomes shockingly easy to kill, and his death ends up being an anticlimax because it goes almost entirely how we'd expect it to.

Venom from Spiderman tends to be better when he's fresh into the universe (he usually ends up turning good for this reason too), because he learns all Spiderman's secrets, and has upgraded versions of his abilities, and we don't know what he can do. Then you learn the symbiote's weaknesses, and the motivation Eddie Brock has, and it all boils down to him being either a antagonistic friend or an outright ally to spiderman a lot of the time. 

On the other hand, a character like Sauron in Lord of the Rings maintains that mystery by acting through proxies like the orcs, Ringwraiths and Saruman. It's not fully clear what he can do and his power is great, even while it's less defined. Because we don't see Sauron's history and his early life he's free to be that less understood force that can do what the antagonist needs to do to keep the plot going.

There's a kind of inverse metric where the more we learn about a character, any character, the more we sympathise with them and the more we understand their point of view, the less evil they seem. Characters with tragic backstories will attract sympathy even if their current goal is to lead the world into the shadow realm. 

Similarly when it comes to power and ability, it's best not to learn too much about their limitations, because it keeps the audience guessing about what they can do. If you do this for a protagonist it comes off as boring Mary Sue writing because they want to do good, but if the antagonist/villain does this it keeps you guessing about what challenges the protagonist has to overcome.",6,2025-12-29 17:05:03+00:00,MEDIUM,3.0,60.946412037037035,"That excitement when the prologue is about a badass villain or other cool mysterious character, and then the disappointment when the book cuts away and we are stuck following some ""relatable"" schmuck for the next 100 pages..."
3cfb0a7e-044d-4620-bef2-68e56f56b14e,1pym2kq,Fantasy,WitWyrd,"Right now storytellers are so hung up on this Dan Harmon Robert McKee Joseph Campbell formula that if the story doesn't start in boringville (the shire, Tatooine, Number 4 Privet Drive, etc) and involve an orphan farm boy having a call to adventure (learning he's a wizard/is a Jedi/is holding a magic artifact so evil it will probably kill the world) and then heading off onto the road of challenges and then down into the abyss (Moria, The Death Star, etc etc) - if it doesnt follow this formula it almost doesn't exist. 

On the other hand can you have progression fantasy with no progression? And if that's the case the character has to start at the very bottom.

Maybe the problem is we've lost sight of the other things fantasy does and can be. Like... the old sword &amp; sorcery books - Grey Mouser &amp; Fahfrd, Conan, Elric, which are more episodic than progression. If progress is made, it's temporary - usually in the form of wealth, treasure, or the permanent removal of a difficult obstacle or enemy. This is what it sounds like you want - some cool assassin doing something full of action from the get go instead of staying from the bottom and crawling upward. 

Then there is the grimdark- again not about progression. In the case of The Black Company you are reading about the bad guys - a band of professional soldiers for hire (including several insane wizards). We're not going from zero to hero, we're seeing orders come some from the employer, and the accomplishment or failure of those tasks. Joe Abercrombie fits here too-- the progression is that Vengeance is finally brutally and cathartically enacted - no one gets any stronger, they don't even feel better or satisfied, they just regain lost honor and self-respect and maybe a little loot.

Then there is literary fantasy where more is going on than just the surface level adventure story - like the elaborate spiritual and literary allegories in Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun, or the stunning and intoxicating dreariness of Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake where the setting itself is so much the focus that it eclipses any character or plot (and likely a giant symbol of the U.K.) Or the Overstory, which absolutely uplifted me in a way no other fantasy story has accomplished. Then three's Leguin's Earthsea which is deeply human deeply moral explorations of power, identity, purpose, love, and our sense of deep connection to the natural world SECRETLY DISGUISED as mere progression fantasy. And Zelazny. Amber is so cool and weird. Lord of Light walks this line been scifi, fantasy, religion, and myth. 

Ooh and don't forget urban fantasy. While Harry Dresden does get stronger, that's never the goal. The goal is to solve mysteries and protect people from big bads. That's the old Buffy formula and you see it in most supernatural teen dramas. But it also includes really wild and fun stuff such as Tim Powers Last Call. And Dying Inside by Robert Silverberg will destroy you if you're the right audience. 

And finally, how deeply have you read your mythology? Just the boring-ass Greek stuff everyone kind of half knows because of Disney and Percy Jackson (ahem, ALL technically progression fantasy)? Do you know about all the rape in Greek myth? About how fucked up and twisted the actual gods are? What about all the really weird myths? What about myth beyond the greco-roman? Norse? Egyptian? Aztec? Buddhist? What about the myth of the indigenous folk near you? What about all the fairy stories and folk lore? What about all the urban legends and creepypasta? This is the source code for fantasy. The place the dreams come from. It's the open air market from which interesting places and creatures and conflicts are purchased. 

My point is - don't expect progression fantasy to be something it can't be. Let it be about orphan farm boy gets numbers go brr - that's part of the fun of it. It's an adolescent male power fantasy, so it's not going to be much else. But that is the fun of it. Boy gets power, learns to use it makes hard choices and even sacrifices and experiences loss, gets stronger, becomes a man. It's necessary and healthy psychic imprinting. The male audience is learning - I will have to leave my comfort zone, learn from an older expert, work really hard and fail a lot, cooperate with others and even learn to rely on them as teammates, experience some really big hard choices tragedy and sacrifice, and eventually become much stronger. Sounds like a good thing for people to learn if you ask me. AND.

It’s just traditional historical fantasy, pretty well executed.

Today, mainstream fantasy, ultimately, is a product, one targeting the most amount of people. To do that, you have to remove friction. Use tropes, stereotypes, simple vocabulary, simple structures. That’s why typical fantasy novels were/are formulaic (going back to Lester Del Rey’s days). Over the decades, the industry has become highly efficient at removing friction.  

What you’re experiencing is also less about comic books, and more about the Marvel movies, video games and, perhaps most of all, anime. Both Bennett and Sanderson are anime fans, and Sanderson is also an avid player. Shonen anime is written for teenage boys and highly formulaic, while the less is said about storytelling in video games, the better (there are exceptions of course, like Disco Elysium).

There’s also the fact that, back in the days of Tolkien and Herbert, those writers were getting influences from other literary genres, while after the Tolkien boom of 70s, and Del Rey’s copycats, fantasy writers started to grow up only on other fantasy writers (and DnD).

So many modern authors are inspired by other fantasy authors, which is fine but your point about reading outside of your genre, as an author, is poignant and true.

The books are funny and have lots of good magic/sorcery/drama, but the dialogue isn't immature or YA (like Sanderson's can be, imo). Recommend.

The prose is like Tolkien in that it's an archaic register, but it's also poetic and has it's own flavor. The world has a magic system, and construction very regimented kind of like Tolkien world. With men and elves and magical races, in WOLAS there's humans but it's bisected into Barbarian Clans that know the old magic and ancient rites (important stuff), and a modernizing towns people on the other side that kicked out the monarchy during a violent rebellion, they pursue trade and want to develop the land. They're constantly at odds, the cities kind of want to evocerate the clans completely and take their land. 

There's also legends of magical races indigenous to the world (elfen types, unicorns and centaurs) and factions of Sorcerers (the closest order of wizards that reminds me of Tolkien's Gandalf archetype that I've come across in fantasy) that act as sort of Magical EMT's and protectors for the world, solving natural disasters, keeping ancient evil sorcery contained, occasionally intervening when bad magic is used in a concerning way by others, there's a conniving matriarchal order of Sorceresses who use a totally different type of magic based on binding control over magically enhanced crystals.

It is such a wonderful and interesting world, the story is based around two princes who are kind of enemies but also are forced to work together, they have respective magically inherited traits of Justice and Compassion that make them very unlike each other, and each has an inherited gift of Light magic and Dark/Shadow magic respectively. The factions of his world want to control and use each of them and there's tons of politicking in every book.  The different plans each faction has (and some are neutral, other very partisan) just make the conflicts feel very real and dramatic at the same time. There's politicking but it's not the same bluntly cynical as ASOIAF, in that series I feel there's lots of examples of the worst of humanity and how anyone might stab anyone in the back. In WOLAS there's politicking but there's also factions that are very united and have values that they stick to. But it's been a while since I read all of ASOIAF, I'm not trying to impugn it's merit but there's a difference of tone and humanity that I think is felt between it and Wars of Light and Shadow.",10,2025-12-28 20:17:20+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.21443287037037037,Any literature that is a sort of middleground between LoTR and ASOIAF?

BotW was a necessary shift for the series to break open any barriers to exploration and adventure. It has flaws and should have been corrected and ultimately refined by a sequel

Instead TotK reuses way too much, adds some weird stuff, the game feels bloated, the story worse, it’s like they didn’t get it at all. They just made a meme machine with an overacted, predictable and simplistic anime-esque story and of course the obvious “made for TikTok” type “cool build mechanic” which is impressive tech but too sandboxy for Zelda and clearly just a fun toy for the devs and a clip/edit machine for social media marketing….(ending is admittedly very epic though)

I know the team can do better. Like you said, the environmental storytelling in BotW felt so interesting and purposeful. The lore in this series has had some really high highs and should be treated better. Same with the legacy of dungeons and bosses and such. 

Like, cmon Nintendo! Zelda is a premier video game franchise. Treat it better than just some jam-packed, video-gamey-ass game.

Here's my summary: Middle-Earth is the prototypical fantasy world, created by JRR Tolkien and based on many things - from local mythology to Old English epics. It was the setting for many of the types of creatures we see across fiction, including relatively recent offerings like Skyrim: Orcs, elves, dragons.

That leads into Faerun, which is a continent on the planet of Toril in the Forgotten Realms game series. The creators of Dungeons &amp; Dragons were heavily influenced by Tolkien, and used his inspiration - among many others, including things as diverse as Lovecraft's huge tentacled monsters (Mindflayers) and even Egyptian myths - to create another broad fantasy setting. The continent is huge, including such spots as Baldur's Gate. 

Finally, there is Tamriel, which has existed only for about thirty years (a long time, but not a RELATIVELY long time here). And that is an imperial fantasy land, which is the basis for the Elder Scrolls games, like Skyrim already mentioned. There are different parts of this overarching continet on the planet Nirn, from Skyrim in the north to Valenwood (home of the wood elves) in the south. 

In short, three different settings - all general high fantasy - all inspired directly or indirectly by Tolkien.",17,2025-12-28 01:13:47+00:00,LOW,6.0,29.795011574074074,"How is Faerun different from Tamriel, Middle-earth, etc?"

He creates extremely original and interesting magic systems.

His writing style is simple and balanced (something is revealed in every chapter, but that revelation never confuses you), which, due to its length, many mistake for complexity and challenge.

These two characteristics are extremely ""viral"" on social media. Think about it... you've read a saga whose individual parts are as long as the Bible and it hasn't bored you... you can brag about it on social media because ""you graduated to being a reader.""

The truth is, if you've read writers with more narrative resources than Sanderson, like Frank Herbert, Robert Jordan, Gene Wolfe, J.R.R. Tolkien, you'll see that Sanderson's writing is quite different. Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, Philip K. Dick, etc... you can't ignore the lack of depth in Sanderson's characters, the absence of memorable dialogue, and how ""suspiciously convenient"" the setting is.

In an ideal world, if scientists had managed to merge Brandon Sanderson's plot planning with Patricia McKillip's narrative technique... we would have the ultimate fantasy writer. Unfortunately, they haven't succeeded... and we have to live with a horde of Sanderson fans who recommend him for everything (even when you ask for a cookbook), simply because he's a simple and entertaining author... and everything else bores them because it's complex, demanding, or old-fashioned.",1,2025-12-28 17:54:32+00:00,LOW,1.0,15.695914351851853,Tell me about your Mistborn experience
f9e85bd0-0d35-4a8a-aa79-9768ccd8b592,1pxdfjq,Fantasy,robotnique,"The biggest difference is going to be that Faerûn (Toril) is a shared world with lots of different authors, Tamriel is also a shared world but explored mostly through the game storylines rather than novels, and Middle Earth is solely the work of Tolkien. 

Why I bring this up is that Faerûn in particular might be the fantasy world with the largest collection of novels based within its setting in all of fantasy, with well over 300 books. This means that every nook and cranny is absolutely jammed with story content, with no one overarching narrative joining things together and an only mostly coherent timeline.

Some regions will have more novels than others, I would guess that The Sword Coast is probably the most used setting. The fun thing about Forgotten Realms is that you can explore a ton of different viewpoints of the few major worldwide events that touch most every plotline. What comes most to my mind, as somebody who last read any of those books 20 years ago, is the Time of Troubles, when uber-god banished the rest of the pantheon from the heavens and made them live amongst mortals. From there you had major events like the death of Mystra, goddess of magic, which caused the spell plague and made all magic users have a really bad time. 

With shared universes though you also get a lot of unevenness in quality and the occasional seemingly contradictory elements. Authors are also kind of limited in what they can bring to the table since you don't want 50 authors all writing about how their characters averted a worldwide apocalypse since it just gets ridiculous and overdone. 

So what world you choose to read about is largely dependent on what you are looking for. Tons of backstory of varying quality, like delving into the individual histories of every European nation? Then Forgotten Realms or Elder Scrolls might be for you. Stories that may have the freedom to be the central plot for their universe but don't have 900 adjoining stories? Then individual authorship might be better for you.",3,2025-12-28 02:01:05+00:00,MEDIUM,2.0,317.9304050925926,"How is Faerun different from Tamriel, Middle-earth, etc?"
3214e6bb-a09f-4b02-80e3-bb2abceb02ed,1pxdfjq,Fantasy,Werthead,"The world of Toril, of which Faerun is one of many continents, was created in the 1960s, so it predates Tamriel by three decades and was about a decade and a half after *Lord of the Rings* (closer to three decades after *The Hobbit* though).

Tamriel partially derived from the home D&amp;D campaigns of the Bethesda team (particularly Kirkman and Kuhlmann), largely developed between *Arena* and *Morrowind*, so I suspect there was a strong D&amp;D and possibly **Forgotten Realms** influence, by way of **RuneQuest** (some of the more metaphysical stuff to do with the world and its existence came from Glorantha). Certainly Tamriel's use of standard D&amp;D races and a medieval fantasy setting but also massively subverting things and making things weird was both a tribute to and reaction against D&amp;D. So really you're asking why **Forgotten Realms** is similar to **Elder Scrolls** (which came long, long after it) when you should be flipping it around. And to be honest I don't think they are that similar other than ""both have giants, elves and dragons (sometimes).""

Certainly when Ed Greenwood developed **Forgotten Realms** from the late 1960s through the 1970s, the glut of Tolkien-esque medieval fantasy hadn't really appeared yet, so his original merging of Tolkien with Norse mythology with sword and sorcery influences was a lot more original than it first seemed. By the time **Forgotten Realms** appeared in print for the first time (in *Dragon Magazine* articles from the tail end of the 1970s onwards), other authors like Terry Brooks had started ploughing the same field. Making **Forgotten Realms** dovetail into D&amp;D further made the setting more ""standard"" than Greenwood originally intended (his original Realms had a different kind of magic, references to which survive as ""the Weave,""). It's also worth noting that the areas he developed were the Dalelands, Cormyr, the Sword Coast, Waterdeep, Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate, areas that did not map 1:1 with real-world influences (Cormyr is closest, and even that's a wild mangling of England and France), but when D&amp;D writers started fleshing out other ideas, they were more inclined to do correlations (due to brutal deadlines), so Mulhorand, originally a desert kingdom populated by steampunk robot servitors, became ""literally just Egypt with exactly the same gods.""

If there is a theme to **Forgotten Realms** it's that the modern-day city-states, kingdoms and empires sit on the ruins of far more ancient, stranger and more magical ones, and that the world's troubles are often caused by the gods (usually ascended mortals) not being able to move on with their lives, and constantly meddling in mortal affairs whether people want them to or not.

If there is another theme, it's that ""any interesting rough edges or attempt at actual original worldbuilding will be sanded off by Wizards of the Coast so they can make more money.""",3,2025-12-28 19:53:53+00:00,LOW,4.0,183.11324074074074,"How is Faerun different from Tamriel, Middle-earth, etc?"

FMC is 30+ and is smart - though more bookish smart and kinda lacking in common sense and wisdom, so she feels younger sometimes, so idk. Book definitely has interesting mystery plot line, though. I also enjoyed the love interest, its a second chances type romance with her being the one who ""bungled"" it in the past. (She chose her ambition over his love)

Of Deeds most Valiant by Sarah K. L. Wilson - FMC is a vagrant paladin knight. She is a practical type, thrown into unknown situation. Her love interest is a fellow paladin, who is trying to avoid her bcs his order is celibate (if he has sex, he loses his magic paladin powers).

The Warm Hands of Ghosts by Katherine Arden - historical fantasy set during WW1. Heroine is a hardened nurse searching for her brother lost in the trenches. Very well written, I loved all characters involved. (there is only bit of a romance in it, not romantasy)

Long Live Evil by Sarah Rees Brennan -  MC is a modern bitter young woman dying of cancer who gets a chance to save herself in a fantasy world and decides to embrace her villainy. Why bother with trying to be good when you can be evil and enjoy yourself? (its tagged as YA by some people on GR, but its considered Adult by publisher and I definitely agree. its not YA type storyline, New Adult if anything).

Even then, I never liked the fact that Bilbo’s birthday is in September! And reading Wolfe as a “translator,” I like that his “translation” choices veer toward the obscure to reinforce the themes of misdirection and unreliability and as a way to put more distance between the reader and this world that is so distant from ours in time and maybe in space. Kai Ashante Wilson’s use of AAVE in The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps similarly serves to reinforce the themes of that book. It’s clear from the first time you see it that it is not out of place in this world.

And even if I allow myself to believe that the book I’m reading was translated from a nonexistent language, I would want the “translator” to maintain the texture of the original and to make choices that are evocative of the culture and attitudes of the people and societies depicted in the work.

Good fantasy writing isn’t necessarily deliberately archaic; it doesn’t have to sound like Edmund Spenser wrote it. It just has to be written in a style appropriate to the story being told and the world being created. After all, the world is made out of words. I would like some indication that the author is taking some care in their word choice.

“Appropriate” is subjective, and what words or stylistic choices are a dealbreaker is going to vary from reader to reader. All I ask is that when I come across an “anachronistic” word, it feels like it’s there for a reason and that the author put some thought into choosing it. “Herculean” might work perfectly fine in the context of one book but look glaringly out of place in another.

c699e1d0-f83a-492b-8290-fc71c3a83158,1pvkmma,Fantasy,ArcaneEnvoy,"I'd push back a bit on the premise though. I think the real differentiator isn't animated versus live-action, but rather how much dedication, budget, and craft goes into the adaptation. The medium itself isn't the problem.

Take Lord of the Rings as the prime example. Peter Jackson's trilogy proves that live-action high fantasy can be absolutely spectacular when done right. The practical effects, the choreography (those battle scenes still hold up decades later), the world-building with actual sets and locations. It worked because the production treated the source material with respect and invested the resources needed to bring Middle-earth to life convincingly. Compare that to something like The Wheel of Time, which feels rushed and underfunded, or the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie, which was just poorly executed across the board.

On the flip side, animation isn't automatically better either. There are plenty of mediocre or failed anime adaptations of manga and light novels that fall flat despite being animated. The medium gives you more freedom with physics and magic systems, sure, but bad writing, poor pacing, or lazy production values will sink an animated show just as fast as a live-action one.

I think what you're really noticing is that anime as an industry has developed a visual language specifically suited to fantasy storytelling over decades. They know how to frame magic, how to pace action, how to make the fantastical feel natural within their medium. Western live-action fantasy is still figuring that out, and when studios cheap out or rush production (looking at you, most Netflix adaptations), it shows immediately. But when they get it right, like with early Game of Thrones or LOTR, it can be just as immersive as any anime.

There is plenty of crappy animated projects and anime that pursue fantasy, and some like the cgi Berserk that ruin the look of what the original concept is.

Exactly. That's the real differentiator: the resources, the dedication, and the vision that's poured into the production. In theory, any high fantasy story could be adapted to that level in live-action, but it requires the right combination of time, commitment, and budget. Most studios simply aren't willing to make that investment.

For me personally, when live-action is done well, it's actually far more immersive than animation. There's something about seeing real actors in physical environments that grounds the fantasy in a way that connects more deeply. But I completely understand that's **subjective**. Some people find animation more immersive because it removes the uncanny valley of CGI effects trying to blend with reality. Neither perspective is wrong, it really comes down to what works for each viewer and how well the adaptation executes its vision regardless of medium.",4,2025-12-25 19:54:13+00:00,LOW,1.0,31.731527777777778,High Fantasy is made for Anime

The LotR films has set the bar so high for fantasy media, I dont think we're likely to see its equal for a long time for alot of reasons. I dont think GoT made anywhere near a splash or is going to leave an impression because of how bad the last 2 seasons were.

Cost is another factor for consideration. Later seasons of GoT were 10 million an episode to produce, top tier animation is a small percentage of that. You can say ""Some people wont watch it because its animated"" and I can say ""No one *can* watch it because it never got made."" Malazan location and set costs alone would be absurd because it happens in every biome that exists and several that don't, then you're looking at insane amounts of CGI for Tlan Imass, Tiste, Kchain Chemalle, etc.

[Victoria Goddard](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8218462.Victoria_Goddard) That's a hard question to answer, actually! I'd say I'm working primarily within the British tradition, particularly the English folklore part of it--my family is English in origin and I grew up with some of the stories as ones my dad told to me, plus we had quite a few collections of fairy stories from various parts of Britain. It's an area I have been interested in for a long time, so I've read a number of collections of folklore and fairy stories (not just British), plus some academic works on the subject, plus the large number of fantasy novels I have read over the years. I also did some research into ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" for a class I was teaching, and got some bits and bobs from that.  
  
Some specific texts: Tolkien's essay ""On fairy stories"" is a classic (I also love his stories 'Leaf by Niggle', 'Smith of Wooton Major', and 'Farmer Giles of Ham'). The 'coloured' fairy books of stories collected by Andrew Lang (""The Red Fairy Book"", ""The Blue Fairy Book"", etc.) are full of stories and variants from around the world, and include many we'd class as ""fairy tales"" that don't necessarily involve the Good Neighbours themselves, but some do. W.B. Yeats' collection of Irish fairy stories is similar but of better literary merit.  
  
Some academic books on fairy lore: ""The Good People"" ed. Peter Narváez (2nd ed, 1997); ""The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries,"" W.Y. Evans-Wentz (first published 1911, republished with an introduction by Terence McKenna 1966, 1994). I also read one that was a study on the figure of Puck/Robin Goodfellow that I remember gleaning a lot from, but I got it out from my university library and I can't recall more details than that.  
  
Really, this is a living tradition, and it remains true folklore--which is very interesting in many ways! You just pick it up here and there, collecting the elements that speak to you out of the vast body of the lore. I get it from reading gardening books that talk about folk names for plants and their uses; or Robert MacFarlane's books about landscape (""The Old Ways""; his new book ""Underland"" is remarkable); or etymologies (real or folk), or place-names or from looking at a British Ordnance Survey Map and wondering at the names of standing stones or farms. From reading the Matter of Britain (Arthurian stories) or books and ballads about Robin Hood (my favourite) or tales from the Welsh Mabinogion or stray bits of the Thousand and One Nights. You get bits and pieces from various novels (Neil Gaiman draws on a lot of British folklore) and then there are books \*about\* the modern fairy tradition like Alexandra Rowland's ""Finding Faeries"" (2020).",28,2025-12-25 01:10:34+00:00,LOW,3.0,62.6296875,Old school Fey and fairy novels?

Tolkien's LOTR wasn't a meditation on the conditions needed to have a hero's journey - a quest. If that is the starting point for PTs understanding of the LOTR Universe then it is pointless discussion, as that was not Tolkien's motivation for writing. 

Sauron is not a character in the traditional sense. He is certainly part of the plot, but he is a disembodied, mythic evil that never interacts with our heroes substantively. Frodo suffers under the hands of those Sauron has corrupted and suffers from Sauron's vessel (the ring), but none of that can be classified as interaction. No Rand al Thor-Shaitan WoT situation equivalent (yes WoT=LOTR derivative).

I'll be honest, I don't think it even makes sense to infer that Sauron was struggling. The game was his to lose. Nobody (apart from greedy men) wanted to touch the One Ring, those possessing any wisdom knowing full well they could not resist its corruption. Evil in that universe is so insidious that resistance to it is futile, best done through complete abandonment of action like sailing for fairer shores. You have the head wizard abandoning the side of good because he didn't think they could win and thought he could outsmart Sauron and keep the ring for himself. Dude was a victim of his own ego(and should be a bright red warning sign to  some readers).

But I digress. If the argument is just: look this is a great starting point to have a conversation about good vs evil, competition and striving without that larger framework. Then, okay sure let's talk about that. But why even invoke LOTR in that case, or worse invoke LOTR to support a position that is in opposition to many of the themes of the story? 

Finally my last thought on the struggle being the positive part? What struggle did Sauron have, what passages can we point to that indicates these struggles? 
Frodo on the other hand, he suffered to the point his life force has been sapped and he is going to sail to the West to alleviate the damage to his soul. We should also note Frodo lost at the very end of his journey and it was Providence that saved all of Middle Earth. I'd even argue the point further and say that there are a couple moments upon which only due to Providence does good win out over Sauron. Gandalfs resurrection being another one. 

So where does that leave us when referring to a man who has built a security apparatus that is going to have long term implications on the ordering of society. Do we see a man who builds things so as to impose order as the type who will make the necessary self sacrifice to throw the ring into fire and destroy it. Or will he be corrupted as well and we are left praying that some dessicated corpses' single bite will aver calamity?

I'd be remiss if I didn't reference Plato's story about the ring of gyges to end my thoughts.. The temptation of a ring with such power will eventually overwhelm whomever has it in their possession. It is too appealing, no matter how morally strong you are, to not end up using it. I've always thought that was such a compelling part of Frodo's story. He does not use the ring for selfish reasons, is so earnest in his honesty and goodness and yet at the penultimate moment couldn't do it. 

I guess this leaves me at two thoughts. Does PT want to create the conditions for such a struggle, assuming that he sees the struggle as the good. And if so, does he feel like he has to turn into Sauron type figure so that a hero arises. Hence starting a company called palantir that will effectively monitor human activity and probably influence it (eye of sauron analogy fits here). 
Does the guy who is obsessed with living forever miss the whole arc on immortality in LOTR and the underlying message being communicated there, or is it just super selective interpretation on his part?",2,2025-07-22 19:45:04+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.0,I'm Afraid I Disagree...

But I guess to answer your question, Link is meant to be the link between the player and the game, hence the name. He is basically mute so they're not putting words in your mouth essentially.  

Per your example, Bilbo may be the protagonist of The Hobbit, and yes we like him as a character, but that doesn't mean that there weren't other Bilbo's throughout the history of the Shire, they just didn't go on adventures. For the dozen ish Links we do have, there are potentially hundreds or even thousands more that pass on the lineage and just didn't have adventure thrush on them. Link and Zelda's innate abilities pass through their bloodlines down the ages.

But Links across time have continuity. The green clothes and cap, they're generally left handed, but each one is the hero of ______ based on the game. Like you're currently playing as the hero of the sky, but the hero of time was the N64 era link. Hero of winds is the guy from the GameCube and DS games. Don't worry about whether or not they're one character, worry about whether you like THAT INCARNATION of that character. Kinda like different people playing the same character throughout time. Think something like Ebenezer Scrooge. It's an odd example because that is the same character, but the way Michael Caine played it is different from Jim Carrey from Alastair Sim. Those are the different Links. The hero of winds is kinda goofy, the hero of time is fairly serious. It's just a different take based on the world they're in.

Edit: thinking about it, it's not just bloodlines. There are two timelines where Link definitely doesn't procreate. So it's also reincarnation as well",3,2026-01-14 22:32:24+00:00,LOW,1.0,25.205520833333335,[All] i'm new to the franchise and i'm kinda confused about Link as a character..

I'd like to highlight something that Mitchell discusses, that is often overlooked when talking about Le Guin's influence: the setting. ""Earthsea is an archipelago, dense with islands at its centre and sparser at its edges, and after my first reading, it joined Tolkien’s Middle-earth to form an elite fantasy-world super-league of two."" At the time Earthsea was first published, true secondary world fantasies (fantasy novels not set in a long-lost or parallel Earth, but in true other worlds that have never existed and with no 'portal' to our Earth) were not super duper common. Tolkien's Middle-Earth was, in his mind, set in the past of the Earth (complete with a timeline that eventually included Jesus); Narnia and Witch World were both portal fantasies; Prydain is maybe secondary world but is extremely Welsh-inflected in execution; and a few, like Pern, are set in the far-future, with humans who have colonized space. I think the Elric books are secondary world (and much earlier than Le Guin), but haven't read them.

And, importantly, Le Guin was the daughter of two anthropologists. So she created a world with anthropological depth, from scratch; it has rites and trade routes and regional practices. It definitely isn't the first secondary world (you can argue about what is, but it almost certainly is before the 20th century, and likely by a lot), but it is unusually important in just creating a land which such depth of feeling that it feels natural. And then secondary worlds really kick off.",22,2025-12-22 20:22:23+00:00,LOW,1.0,33.88842592592592,Wizard of Earthsea's influence

Its an interesting article, but I don't really get that part of it.

The author claims that in all of fantasy, only Middle-earth, Earthsea, and Westeros could as ""elite fantasy-worlds"":

&gt; Earthsea is an archipelago, dense with islands at its centre and sparser at its edges, and after my first reading, it joined Tolkien’s Middle-earth to form an elite fantasy-world super-league of two. (George RR Martin’s Westeros has since made it three, but CS Lewis’s Narnia feels too fey and allegorical to qualify.)

I don't see how you can reasonably get there.  Narnia get discarded from the list because its too ""fey and allegorical"".  But I guess Middle-earth isn't too allegorical for some reason.

And maybe places like the Hyborian Age apparently don't count because its a mythological past of Earth, but then again Middle-earth is the same thing.  So that doesn't even work.

So I think that the author is saying that Pern, Leiber's Nehwon, Norton's Witch World, the Hyborian Age, etc don't count as ""elite fantasy-worlds"" because they aren't good enough.  Its really the only explanation that works with any logical consistency given that Middle-earth isn't a true secondary world.  Or, more likely, the author isn't very well read when it comes to fantasy.

So yeah, I appreciate that the author is trying to talk up Earthsea, but it does read to me as more than a little dismissive of other major fantasy works.  Which is too bad.",1,2025-12-23 02:53:12+00:00,LOW,1.0,27.772962962962964,Wizard of Earthsea's influence

With that being said:

Tolkien was the big change that happened in the mid 50s (when Lord of the Rings was published).  Prior to that, authors nearly always (with a very few exceptions) had ties to the real world.  This is covered somewhat at:

https://contentinfantasy.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-secondary-world.html

&gt; Edward James, former professor of Medieval History at the University College in Dublin, wrote:  “After 1955 fantasy writers no longer had to explain away their worlds by framing them as dreams, or travellers’ tales, or by providing them with any fictional link to our own world at all.” Here James was referring to the publishing of The Lord of the Rings, the original epic fantasy which popularized the secondary world. Even though Tolkien had said that Middle-earth was simply a pre-history of our world, we all know that Middle-earth is a fictional world outside any realm we’ve ever known.

Sharps by KJ Parker, its focused on a group of young fencers who travel to a foreign country to do fencing demonstrations. Its quite mature but probably in the right ballpark.

Recently, I re-watched LOTR trilogy theatre re-release and even the extended edition doesn't offer much about Grima Wormtongue's desire for Eowyn. In the movies, it is kind of played off as a underling simply wanting a beautiful noble woman, but the expressions of the actors told of a much richer history between them. Obviously, there is no room in the, already quite crowded, trilogy to explore this relatively insignificant subplot.

The other day, I found an author who wrote a bunch of a fics that treated this Grima/Eowyn ship, that by all rights should be a crackship or at least non-con only, as a ship that works in both a con and dub-con context. The author was able to cobble together canon aspects about their personality and background that turns this insane sounding pairing into something more reasonable (and without relying on making the female character weak/stupid either, huge plus in my book).

It's amazing to me that there are some incredibly good writers out there putting out fics around stuff most people wouldn't consider until they scrolled past it and thought, ""Wait, what? I need to take a second look."" Then they read it and are blown away. That was me the other day, ""No way someone actually wrote this... Wow, that actually works...

Corporate Dems have long enjoyed their controlled opposition model of being not quite as bad as team R. So they have not had to or wanted to do much beyond patching up the economy after a prior R administration's drunken binge in office.

This kept their Wall Street donors happy. They further maintained their fund raising issues, like Roe V Wade, and they could occasionally trot out the odd progressive improvement on some donor neutral front. They avoided rocking the boat as they slowly filtered upwards in seniority.

All of which is to say, they haven't needed to fight effectively against anybody but rude little progressives making donor offending noises out in the sticks. Performative 'sternly worded letters' and the odd fiery speech given to empty rooms were enough for their campaign coffers. Win some, lose some, business as usual continued.

So when they are finally called upon to battle existentially, it sadly resembles Tolkien's 'The battle of Helm's Deep', but without the reinforcements. A bunch of old men reluctantly donning rusty gear they've not trained on in living memory.

So I agree, it is all they know how to do, but it is absolutely inadequate to the moment at hand.

In the MCU example, Thor is a God because he is/was worshipped as a god. God is just the word for innately powerful beings from other dimensions (in the MCU).


So, Hulk is not worshipped. He is not from another dimension. He is not innately powerful. Therefore, even though he is potentially more powerful than Thor, he is not a God.

Hey r/movies. Nik here to answer your questions! AMA. Back at 6 PM ET.

Here's the trailer for The Parenting, out today on Max:

More stuff:

Nik Dodani stars as the lead of the New Line Cinema horror-comedy The Parenting alongside Edie Falco, Lisa Kudrow, Brian Cox, Brandon Flynn, Parker Posey, and more. The film follows a young couple, Rohan (Nik) and Josh (Brandon), who host a “meet the parents” weekend at a cozy rental house in the country, only to find it is haunted by a 400-year-old poltergeist. Most recently, he wrote and directed Blue Boy, a short film adaptation of Rakesh Satyal's novel. He is widely known for his role as “Zahid” on the Netflix series Atypical, as well as for roles on the CBS sitcom reboot Murphy Brown, the Universal features Dear Evan Hansen and Twisters, and a Broadway debut as “Ogie” in Waitress.

As a writer, Nik started in stand-up comedy and made his late-night debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. He has worked as a creator in the political and non-profit world, writing and directing content for groups like MoveOn.org, Alicia Keys’ HIV/AIDS initiative, and various electoral campaigns.",1,2025-03-21 13:52:32+00:00,LOW,5.0,321.4190625,"Hey r/movies!

In most of my experience, the Left's prescription for men is that they make way so that the ""future is female"" or that they are responsible for the actions of other men either historical or present. I don't believe expecting/desiring male subservience or guilt are either reasonable or helpful if men are to be an equal partner in building the world as women are. I have not seen a Left-leaning individual who promotes a type of masculinity that would align with what is considered ""positive masculinity"" -- something along the lines of Aragorn or a Terry Crews.

That just depends or what ""non-canon"" thing they're describing. AU and canon divergence have some overlap imo. Take LOTR for example: AU where Sam is the ring bearer and Frodo is his helper instead, would be similar to ""canon divergence where Sam is the main ring bearer instead of Frodo"". You can still have Frodo be Sam's helper in this canon divergence which would be VERY similar to AU.

""AU where Rachel left for France and left Ross behind"" is the same as ""Canon divergence of *Friends* finale where Rachel left for France"".

It's still ""alternate universe""... just in the 'multiverse' meaning, where a one differend decision changes the story.

Of course, ""AU"" can still mean ""Frodo and Sam are lawyers trying to bring a mob boss Sauron to justice"", or ""Faramir and Eowyn meet in a coffe shoop AU"", or ""Gandalf and Galadriel are Greek Gods trying to defeat Titan Sauron with the help of demigods Aragorn, Frodo and Merry"".

While it’s absolutely possible to have a 100k fic that isn’t well fleshed-out, I am firmly of the belief that a fic should be only as long as needed to tell that particular story well.  And MAYBE that’s 500k words, but if your fic is longer than the entire LOTR trilogy, I sure hope it’s an epic.

9e61c13a-ace1-4cc2-a17c-fd69022db46d,1j4q8ik,AO3,Camhanach,"Culture and representation IS an important conversation to have, but you need to translate it to how this applies to fic instead of just ~~insult~~ presume an awful lot about me for being born in a different place than you.

This is what I believe of the available options. Yes, people aren't writing for you and your culture. Yes, that can suck esp. when you see things from your culture and get a sense that it's being butchered. I get that sense anytime I see various bits of the culture even done right, because I can't recognize even that. I'm butchered away from my culture. I get how that feeling sucks.

But what American writers write has as little connection to your culture as any Tolkien fiction to it, or as what you said about America to me, though, and this is fine.

It's a feature of fictionalization, not just Americanization.

Americanization is a subset of fictionalization—there are things to talk about there, sure, like about appropriation. Fic writers who are one-off instances of people and not the repository of a whole culture, however, don't bear the brunt of that conversation for writing as they will.

People who aren't in your culture, who aren't writing as though they are, who are writing portrayals that preponderance of odds say wouldn't be culturally sensitive because you are complaining about smut fic—they're writing something that has zilch to do with what you're talking about.

Like mafia AUs are not about the Sicilian mob, despite that the whole violence conversation is important there too.

Or maybe it does all tie together. Idk how you'd tie any of this back to fic. You just . . . haven't done so.

And kinda on a separate track: Names that have a point in antiquity and carried through with living people, too me, exist as *both.* However Hera and Zeus exist now, they existed previously. No one is **trying** to portray your culture and no one else **could.**

**Since they could not,** them writing from their own cultural perspective is just them writing from their own ~~cultural~~ perspective, of which culture is a part. It's all hard to separate and that separation is not even the goal.

So, if you want to have yours represented—nothing, but nothing, is stopping you. And nothing someone else does could stand in for it either!

But wholly fuck to just Americanize me like that while knowing nothing of my history? That was  bad feeling, my person. My one parent was beat up fairly often for looking too European. That looks plain white to you, I'd guess and *acknowledge that I'm only guessing,* but I assure you that the actual Americans did not see it that way. Do you *want* American to just be a monolith? It's . . . really not.

Also—that I answered to any of that stuff and filled in personal details is because of the disservice you did to the topic. It wasn't about me. It wasn't about some belief you have that, from poverty, I control what's on TV. (\*There, returned to that topic. I may benefit from it, I don't get to shape it! And being queer, I don't linearly benefit.) Then there's your belief that I even watch American TV. (Though yeah that's 50/50 unless we count the shows I rewatch, then it's barely American TV at all that I watch.)

. . . I wonder who else always gets blamed for controlling the media, like, really? You can't be more critical than that. Group membership isn't this essentializing thing that you seem to think it is! Like, my aforementioned alienated feelings just pushed me along the American route that is individualization, sure, but the individualization continued on from there. \[Also: A comparison, not a condemnation. I just think that the right mode of analysis here is people and hope that that highlights why while acknowledging why that argument can be hard to see as anything but American.\]

I'm glad you have a stronger connection to your culture, I know it's not a blanket benefit either (I don't even sound American because of speech issues) and I wish my culture wasn't left behind to me.

How's this relate to fanfiction?

Again, for me, it's that 1) people are not (just their) culture and 2) fiction is not (required to be) representation. So, fanfiction is just about individuals. Which is why we don't yuck other people's yum, because other individuals are not about us.

ETA: Happy to have other conversations about what goes into representation when that is the intent, and when some piece of writing may veer so off course even without ill-intent that it needs to be addressed. I just doubt that smut fic is where that veering happens or that at least if that is where, hey, at least it being smut fic already undermines misportrayal.

ETA 2: ""\[...\] Maria the movie, you don't see them cast in Percy Jackson"" never seen, never seen, saw one ep. of American Gods and the first Captain America.

I *know* that those media have issues, this is where the scale of fanfic is a thing you'll probably have seen mentioned before. It's just not that big an audience. (Also I'm anti-religious, the idea of being part of any new religion made me throw up in my mouth a little, even/esp. the religion that is nationalism.)",2,2025-03-07 01:49:49+00:00,LOW,1.0,328.35614583333336,God of Olympus / Greek Mythology AUs

Trump and his team came out of the election with, to use the language of Steve Bannon, “muzzle velocity”, throwing as much disruption as possible at the system all at once and hoping to paralyze it with volume. They are backing down wherever they see resistance, not sticking around to fight their way through to victory on every encounter. When you hear him explain how they planed it you start seeing it’s intended to be just starter motor, not the long term strategy. The long term strategy is to make decisions outside the public eye and have loyalists implement them. 

The outcomes of what Trump has done divide into two categories: 

That which will endure after Trump and that which will get cleaned up. 

The second category won’t help Putin because it will get cleaned up.

The first category is more tricky. A more divided America. A dumber America due to neglected education, journalism etc. A more impoverished America. And most importantly, a no longer trusted to be unbreakable America, trust which gave it special world’s reserve currency and unique arms trade platform benefits. And **superficially** it may look like Putin scored a jackpot here.

Except he didn’t. Japan didn’t score the jackpot by fucking Pearl Harbor over. It awoke a sleeping giant and set the stage for its absolute defeat.

Putin didn’t score the jackpot by demoting the US from its Breton Woods perch. He awoke a more united, a more determined, and a far less paralyzed Europe. 

Peter Zeihan talked about breaking the globalized world into semi-globalized, multi-national groupings that satisfy **economic** necessity -  where each such grouping would have a few low wage countries to produce, a few developed ones to consume and capitalize, and a few with navies to secure the whole thing. US/Canada/Mexico would be one, Australia/NZ/Japan/Skorea/SE-asian countries would be another. Corps that own all the factories (Unilever, P&amp;G) would have a maximally self sufficient supply chain in each. This is the world’s new architecture.

And the new awoken Europe is driven by security before economic, but will follow a half-similar grouping - where the grouping needs to contain countries that are willing to fight (Ukraine, Poland, Baltics, Finland, Czechia), countries that have the know-how to make weapons and ideally cheap labor, and countries with a will to see it through and deep pockets (France, Germany, UK, etc), and external enablers (South Korea sharing a lot of arm manufacture IP without insisting jt be made all the way over there in Korea, Canada, Au/Nz, US). Note the distinction between arms makers like Germany/italy/France, who have traditional, publicly traded low unit volume, high labor high tech capability, with the Polands and Ukraines (and possibly Germany), who command cheaper labor and absolutely massive order books for standing fighting militaries. 

This makes for a tighter grouping than the US led NATO of yesteryear, and refocus on “you’re either contributing to this or go sit in that outer circle out”, designing a fighting force rather than a zero magazine depth theatrical one, and not expecting all countries to do everything. The fighting in this model is placed on the lap of the countries who will have the political will to do so, and it be asked of those who won’t. 

This reconfiguration is absolutely **terrible** for Putin. It’s a Grima-removal king of Rohan situation. What’s there jumped from the paralysis end of the spectrum all the way to the other extreme, with Germany going “We need guns, **lots** of guns” and France going “We fucking told you. We knew of this day. We have fully European nukes”. **What this means is that all European armies will have weapon systems in each category not gated by ITAR and US perimssion to use**. They don't need to scrap their entire F-35 order, just half of it. I submit that the enduring trust damage Putin is done is - while bad for America - even more bad for Putin, and this category of Trump’s actions will present Putin with a far harsher reality on his borders with adversaries far less inhibited to get in the mud and get all dirty.

America is a loser. But from this, Putin is no winner.",2,2025-05-31 21:57:35+00:00,MEDIUM,2.0,358.0130787037037,Trump’s Embrace of Putin Shows Few Results

Kegans cognitive development phases look like this (I copy-pasted [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_developmental_framework))

Stage 1: Purely impulse or reflex-driven (infancy and early childhood).

Stage 2: The person's sense of self is ruled by their needs and wishes. The needs and wishes of others are relevant only to the extent that they support those of the person. Effectively the person and others inhabit two ""separate worlds"" (childhood and adolescence).

Stage 3: The person's sense of self is socially determined, based on the real or imagined expectations of others (post-adolescence).

Stage 4: The person's sense of self is determined by a set of values that they have authored for themselves (rarely achieved, only in adulthood).

Stage 5: The person's sense of self is no longer bound to any particular aspect of themselves or their history, and they are free to allow themselves to focus on the flow of their lives


The vast majority of people are in stages 2-3. Few people ever manage to progress past stage 3 and a large part of this is how society is structured. A stage 2-3 person is easier to control and profit from than the later stages who are more independent, principled, and don't fit neatly into boxes.

Higher cognitive stages recognize paradox and live with it--often without solving it--they recognize that there is no perfect system or meta-system, and ask themselves ""what truly matters?"" When orienting themselves.

Stage 5 is ego death and the complete surrender of the self. Like Nikolai Tesla believing himself to be a ""vessel for ideas to flow through"", Buddha, Christ, Gandalf .etc. They detach from the world without apathy. They recognize the finite span of their lives and act to raise others up. They recognize themselves not as the river, but the riverbank.",17,2025-04-20 13:43:29+00:00,LOW,1.0,150.7302662037037,Going full circle. Long personal story

Its also worth noting that the Dwarves, of all Middle Earth were the only ones who could not be turned to Sauron by the Rings of Power. The Rings led them down dark paths, but never to Sauron. They were just to stubborn to be suborned by his will.

The Dwarves were created by the Aule before the awakening of Elves and Men. Aule is one of the strongest Valar and wanted to teach his creations. Iluvatar, the G-d of Tolkien's world, granted them independent life.

Far from being simply ""greedy,"" Dwarves are steadfast, loyal, and incredibly resilient. Their love of treasure is paired with their love of craftsmanship, they're artisans who appreciate materials for their beauty and potential, not just their monetary value. The Dwarves worked together with the elves to create some incredible items.

As for ""financing wars,"" this is a complete mischaracterization. Dwarves are fighters who defend their homes and occasionally ally with Elves and Men against common enemies. They're never portrayed as shadowy financiers. I’m pretty well-versed in Tolkien’s work and have never seen an example of this, but if you have one I’d be interested to see it (and not from the movies, directly from the books).

As r/looktowindward pointed out, one of the most telling aspects of Dwarven character is their resistance to corruption.

Additionally. the Dwarves weren't ""kicked out"" due to character flaws but were driven from their homes by dragons and other disasters. In the first age after the destruction of much of the earth, including the mountains where the Dwarves lived, they had to flee their homes and traveled east to Khazad-dum. In the second age, the Dwarves generally settled down. The second age was actually the golden-age of the Dwarves. In the third age, Khazad-dum was destroyed by the Balrog and Orcs and Dwarves tried to flee. The gray mountains and the lonely mountain were attacked by dragons, once again the Dwarves had to flee. They are continuously kicked out of their homes. The songs of the Dwarves speak of longing for their ancestral homes. ""Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold"" is an account of displacement and the desire to reclaim what was wrongfully taken.

Their isolation in places like Khazad-dum, Nogrod, and Belegost wasn't from arrogance but practical necessity after facing threats like Dragons, Balrogs, and Orcs. The Dwarf kingdoms were sealed not out of disdain for other races but for protection after experiencing devastating losses.

Every race in Tolkien's world has fundamental flaws. The Noldor elves who were supposed to be some of the purest beings killed other elves and were banished from the Undying Lands for it. As for Men, Tolkien shows their weakness and selfishness in a number of ways.

I think people trying to place antisemitic tropes on Tolkien's writing because ""Dwarves=antisemitic"" is wrong, and the only parallel Tolkien drew was their language and being displaced from their homeland. Being how anti-Nazi Tolkien was, I'd say he was a friend of the Jews, but again, we'll never know for certain.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",5,2025-03-19 00:51:39+00:00,LOW,1.0,1.7237847222222222,J.R.R Tolkien’s response to a publishing house in Nazi Germany inquiring whether he was Jewish or not.

21144ba4-0fc8-4d02-b11a-980b58e558a5,hncwe5,PeterThiel,cashitter,"""Peter Thiel will be neck-and-neck with Graeme Hart for the title of  richest New Zealander following the long-anticipated public listing of  his spook software company, Palantir.

Palantir released a brief statement on Tuesday saying it had filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a sharemarket listing.

The brief filing offered no financials, valuation or timeline.

A  US$20 billion private equity valuation being bandied about in the media  today dates from 2015, and Palantir's business has grown considerably  since, particularly during the Trump administration. Palantir's recent  new business includes new profiling tool business for the US Immigration  and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) and, reportedly, a new contract  with the US Department of Health and Human Services to build a  coronavirus-tracking tool. A worldwide push to parlay its spy business  into pandemic tracking has seen a similar deal with the UK government -  although an offer to help the New Zealand Government [ went begging ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12346419) .

 When IPO talk last surfaced, for a mooted listing in the second half of  2019, the Wall Street Journal reported, ""After Palantir shared some of  its internal metrics with Morgan Stanley bankers, the bank returned with  a range of US$36b to US$41b for a 2020 public offering.""

 Thiel's stake in Palantir has never been made public, but Forbes has put  it at 10 per cent - meaning his holding would be worth US$4.1b if the  company does list at a US$41b valuation.

Current estimates of Thiel's wealth - around US$2.3b - lean heavily on his early investments in PayPal and Facebook.

Once a public listing unlocks his wealth in the mysterious Palantir, then Thiel could be worth US6.4b ($9.2b).

 That would see him breathing down the neck of Graeme Hart, whom the NBR  Rich List 2019 put on $10b, and ahead of the Todd family ($4b), ex-pat  banker Richard Chandler ($3b) and the toy-empire Mowbray siblings (also  $3b).

And although Hart's packaging business was recently on the backfoot, as revenue [ dropped ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12302620)  for calendar 2019, Palantir's business is reportedly in high-growth -  if profitless - mode with revenue reportedly increasing from US$750m to  US$1b last year) - and it could be one of the few that booms from the  pandemic and the general rise in surveillance.

A post-listing share-price surge is possible, which could in turn easily leapfrog Thiel past Hart.

Thiel  has also been in the news lately as an early financial backer of  Clearview AI, the controversial startup, recently trialled by NZ Police [ without ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12331487) clearance. Clearview scraped 2.8b images from Facebook and other social media sites to create a facial recognition database.

Although now sidelined in NZ, Clearview says it is being used by more than 2000 law enforcement agencies.

## Afghanistan to NZ

 Co-founded by Thiel and Alex Karp in 2004, Palantir makes software that  helps security and law enforcement clients like the NSA, CIA and FBI  mine mountains of ""big data"" from electronic surveillance.

It  was named after a mystical, all-powerful seeing stone used by the evil  wizard Saruman in JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (of which Thiel is  said to be a major fan).

Its software is credited with helping US authorities hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden.

Our  GCSB and SIS won't confirm or deny if they are Palantir customers but  the company has an office in Wellington and the GCSB has advertised for  staff proficient in Palantir's software. Born-and-bred Kiwi Jonty Kelt  is one of Palantir's most senior executives. And a Herald investigation [ uncovered ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12026641) that the NZ Defence Force has spent more than $7.2m with Palantir since 2012.

 And on its website currently, as part of a recruitment campaign for  software engineers, Palantir says, ""We meet problems where they live.  Wherever our users are — whether it's Afghanistan or Atlanta, New York  or New Zealand — we are there too"".

Thiel hit local headlines in 2017 when it was [ revealed ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11790034) he had been made a New Zealand citizen since 2011 - despite spending just 11 days in the country.

 The German-born, Californian-resident entrepreneur's Kiwi passport was  fast-tracked as he invested millions in local startups including Xero  and Vend.

Thiel  subsequently lost enthusiasm for local tech investments but did become a  prolific buyer of property around Queenstown and Wanaka, as [ featured ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=12224426) in the Vice documentary, Hunt for the Bunker People.

## The art of the Thiel

 Thiel donated millions to the Trump campaign in 2016, and spoke at the  Republican National Convention in the run-up to the election.

However, a recent Wall Street Journal report [ said ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12345514) Thiel has become disillusioned with Trump over his coronavirus response.

 The paper noted the billionaire was not down to speak at this year's  Republican convention, and he has not donated any money to the Trump  2020 campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.""",3,2020-07-08 07:50:26+00:00,LOW,1.0,978.2470138888889,Palantir listing could make Peter Thiel the richest New Zealander

Many, many people - even many sermons get this wrong.

Matthew 7:13-14 (ESV) “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.”

Note it is not a narrow path.  In Lord of the Rings, Galadriel, perhaps the most powerful elf, tells Frodo, “Your Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while all the Company is true.”

However, our God is far more gracious:  we have a narrow gate, a difficult path, but a narrow gate.  The major distinction is one passes a gate but once on one’s journey, then one is on the difficult path, where straying, even more than a little, will not bring ruin.  Our hope is much greater and broader than that shared with Frodo.  Once one has passed the gate, salvation is assured.

One still will answer for what one does and decisions and actions have consequences.  For example, see: Matthew 12:36-37 (ESV) I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”

Revelation 3:15-16 (ESV) “‘I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.

Even my decision to reach out to you has consequences for me:  James 3:1 (ESV)  Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.

Still I do this willingly, even eagerly, as I feel the urging of the Holy Spirit to try to help address your concern.

Exampe: Frodo from Lord of the Rings. Does the character Frodo exist? No, he does not. Does he exist in a story? Yes. Is the story real? No. Thus, Frodo does not exist even though the story is something that we all agree about, insofar as we all agree on the story of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" otherwise it could not be a story because it would not be a shared concept. But you see, concepts don't actually exist. Other example: the equation area = pi \* r\^2 does not actually exist, insofar as it is not floating out there in the universe or in the mind of God or whatever.  It is simply a perfect descrpition of how to find the area of a perfect circle. This is the fatal flaw that transcendental idealists say, they say that things like 'math,' 'meaning,' 'morality,' and other such things exist when a) math is a description of reality not smoething we can 'discover' b) meaning is whatever God would make it to be, thus making it subjective, and even if meaning was a part of God's mind, i.e., an eternal idea that he had, it would just be that, an idea, thus making it completely subjective c) same thing goes for morality, it can't be objective. Does this mean I can do whatever I want? No, of course not, there are other forms of morality without transcdental iditiotic bullcrap.

So at the end of the day what exists is what exists in the unniverse, or, perhaps, if we are all in the mind of God, then experience would the only true existence, but even then, objective morality, objective meaning, and even math wouldn't exist.

So I reject all your Buddhist transcdental bullshit.

I was physically hyperactive as a small child, started walking (read: running) early, frequently ran out into the road, would climb and run on everything in a dangerous way etc.
I absolutely couldn’t *wait*, I remember thinking that “just five minutes” was such a lie because five minutes felt like an eternity!
My first memory is getting punished by my mom for not being able to calmly wait while she chatted with a neighbour, I believe I was 3 at that point.

Sensory issues were always a thing for me. In kindergarten (3-5) would take off my panties because the sensation of wearing them was intolerable, and hide them, because I knew I was supposed to wear them. During the cold winter months, my parents would dress me in multiple layers… and I would take off the bottom layers and freeze my ass off. (To this day, I cannot wear long johns, it triggers extreme, uncontrollable rage in me)

I believe I was a weird mix of unusually bright and dumb as a fucking rock. I taught myself to read when I was 3, but would cry with frustration because my fine motor skills didn’t really let me write until I was 5-6 (?), and even then it wasn’t really pretty or neat. I learned a bunch of math before starting school, but when my teachers wanted me to “explain my reasoning” I couldn’t do it. There was no reasoning, my brain just gave me the answer. I would read novels like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter in English (second language that we started learning in 2nd grade) when I was in 5th grade, but I couldn’t read and recall shit I wasn’t interested in.

My math teacher in 4th-6th grade would let me sit outside class and do assignments while listening to music, because it worked better than having me be bored and restless in class, and I loved her for it.

“Doesn’t pay attention”, “can’t take verbal instructions” and “breaks rules” (that I didn’t know existed because I wasn’t paying attention) were frequent evaluations

One thing my DX spouse talks about is his struggle to sit with discomfort. He can’t tolerate cringe, embarrassment, etc. When he feels shame, his brain immediately and subconsciously deflects it. As the nearest person, it often deflects to me.

In a sense it is, in the tradition the ultimate end of evil was often referred to as ""non-being"" (for instance in St. Athanasios), that is the fundamental distortion of ones existence as a rational person - ones individuality. One image of hell that I like a lot because it  visually illustrates this ultimately spiritual state are the Nazgul in LOTR whose existence is reduced to invisible shadows who barely have any existence except their impersonal will enslaved to evil.

&gt;Why does a physical death impose a limitation on God's ability to forgive, which seems to me must be the case if he wants to forgive them?

Well, I addressed it in the above comment: *Gods forgiveness is on offer to everyone. Thats not contested. The question is whether people actually want to seek forgiveness*. In other words, there is no limit on His ability to forgive.

&gt;Or is it that something about being in hell makes you incapable of wanting to reconcile with God?

Its rather that ones unwillinness to reconcile with God leads to the state we refer to as hell. I like to believe that if there is even a bit of goodness in a persons will God can use it as a ""gate"" through which salvific grace can ""pour"" much like in the Story of the Onion in The Brothers Karamazov..

I'd like to think you're right. And there are other male friendships in LOTR. Merry and Pippin. Legolas and Gimli.

&gt;Tolkien wrote of the openly gay poet W.H. Auden as “one of my great friends,” and Auden wrote glowing reviews of The Lord of the Rings when it came out (they also had a fight because Auden visited Tolkien’s house and said that it was “hideous,” but that’s another story). As described by author Reynolds Price, at least one member of Tolkien’s friend group, the Inklings, “separated from his wife and lived a quietly homosexual life.” Most interesting to me, Tolkien was a teacher and fan of Mary Renault, a writer who spent her life in a romantic relationship with another woman. She became an icon in the gay male community for writing sympathetically about same-sex relationships in ancient Greece. Tolkien wrote that he was “deeply engaged” in her books, and that a letter she sent him was “the piece of ‘Fan-mail’ that gives me the most pleasure.”

And much more in the article. Not conclusive. But I find it convincing.

I really do not understand how folks can be so rude as to completely disregard everything I said, despite numerous sources supporting my claim.

I took some screenshots illustrating the differences between the official 4K master and a fan project that used the colors from the DVD. 4K masters are on the top. All the life of the films have been completely sucked out of each frame. There's no color palette to speak of, no ethereal colors - all just desaturated gunk.

I disagree. The 4K editions are riddled with issues, ranging anywhere from terrible colors and weird ‘Hobbit inspired’ desaturated and heavily vignetted flashback sequences, to sloppy AI upscaling resulting in strange artifacts. 

I encourage anyone who is interested in this topic to do a side by side comparison, or even Google the issue, and the differences between the versions are abundantly clear.

Just do a quick search on the topic and a ton of issues regarding the 4K releases use of upscaling and DNR might teach you a thing or two about film.

Yes I've watched the 4K versions on good HDR displays. I even watched the recent re-release in theaters. It's the same there. None of the points I brought up are new - these are well documented issues with the 4K releases. Here are some screenshots I took from a random YouTube video comparing the different versions. These are DVD compared to 4K releases.

[https://imgur.com/a/L0JOOth](https://imgur.com/a/L0JOOth)

Let's look at these two from Rivendell, in particular:

[https://imgur.com/a/oT0nIwi](https://imgur.com/a/oT0nIwi)

The original release of the film (and the previous home releases, other than 4K and the cursed FOTR EE release) have a completely different color grading approach. Rivendell, and other Elven locations, have an out of this worldy, almost ethereal look and feel to them. All of these colors are completely washed out in the 4K releases, and every location looks exactly the same because the colors are graded to look similar. Gone are the soft blues of Lothlorien, or the fiery reds of Mount Doom, the cold as steel grading of Isengard's betrayal or the lushous greens of Amon Hen. It all just looks the same now - washed out and un-inspiring.

If you think my comparisons make the non-4K release look like 'poop', that's an opinion you're entitled to. The 4K releases are sharp - no question about that - but the colors are dull and are nothing like my VHS copies, or my DVD copies, or other releases. The extended edition of FOTR was cursed, but the rest are great.

That's a logical fallcy. If something is “beyond our understanding,” then using any terms to describe it — familiar or not — is meaningless. Saying “God,” “energy,” “force,” or “infinite love” while claiming it's beyond comprehension is trying to have it both ways.

&gt; I forget the book, but there is an interesting afterlife scenario. In it, when a person dies their afterlife is dependent on the way they had a spiritual connection to what humans called gods. Vikings got a Valhalla, Christians got a heaven, Buddhists were reincarnated, those without spiritual beliefs existed in a sleeping, dreamless state, etc.

In the Lord Of The Rings, when the elves die they do to Mando's chambers in Valinor. That doesn't make me believe Gandalf is real.

Just because a scenario is emotionally resonant, poetic, or internally consistent doesn’t mean it reflects anything about actual reality

&gt; I am willing to acknowledge that I don't know. I think the point is that you'll never know. 

That's basically Pascal's Wager, which is morally bankrupt.  It treats belief as a bet, not a conviction. Belief isn’t just a switch you flip. You can’t choose to believe in something you find implausible just to cover your cosmic bases.

Please pardon the weird bold point formatting, that's something that helps me not get lost when preaching.

**So we return to the matter of suffering.** I know that suffering is one of the greatest challenges in faith.  Many people have struggled to make sense of it, yet it seems so senseless.  Critics of our faith are quick to point out that a world ruled by a just and loving God shouldn’t have suffering. It’s like an equation that doesn’t balance. 

**As I think about that, I keep coming back to the same question - w*****hat makes a story good?*** 

You might say you need good characters, engaging writing style. And the story has to be relatable one way or another.  All those features are important, but a good story is more than that.  One of the most crucial ingredients in a good story is *conflict.* You ever notice that? Doesn’t matter if it's a comedy or a tragedy — every good story needs to establish a sense of conflict. But why is conflict so important to a story? Don’t you think we all have enough conflict and tension in our lives as it is? 

Now I suppose a story without conflict would feel a bit boring, like reading a grocery list. But I think the bigger point is that the conflict in stories helps show us how to make sense of the conflict in our own lives.  Suppose you’re reading the story of an intense battle. As the author describes how the enemy overwhelms the gates, your heart rate quickens. You feel the sweat on your palms. The situation is desperate. It continues with the blast of a horn, and in the feeble light of the rising sun, reinforcements appear on the horizon. I’ll confess, Tolkien tells the story of that battle better than I do —  the battle of Helm’s deep

**As it happens, the Gospel is a** ***good story.*** 

That’s actually what the word “gospel” means. It came from the Old English “god spel"" - like a good tale, a good story.  I think sometimes we get so caught up seeing Scripture as a series of moral lessons, we lose sight of how it’s also an epic story, spanning back to the creation of time itself. So what is the conflict of this good story? How do we relate to it?

One of my favorite things about the liturgical calendar — and Holy Week in particular —  is how it helps us to step into the story. We don’t treat the passion as if it was just some event that happened 2000 years ago — in these services, we reenact the tumultuous final days of Jesus’ life, placing ourselves in the drama

From the gates of Jerusalem this morning, to the upper room on thursday, to the long hard walk of the cross on friday, and the tomb on saturday night. This week truly is the climax of the Christian story. I encourage you to take note of all the services listed in the Bulletin and to join us throughout the week, whether in person or online. The joy of Easter, like the resolution to any good story, is all the more profound the more we find ourselves immersed in the drama

**There is so much more to come. But remember this. Just like stories use conflict to help us make sense of the hardships in our own lives,  in this good story, Jesus’ suffering is here to give meaning to** ***your*** **suffering. The story of the Passion is really the story of all creation — betrayal in a garden, suffering, shame, and death. If Jesus dies and the story ends there, then our critics are right. That meaningless suffering would show this world is ruled by a cruel, uncaring God. But there is only one ending that can give meaning to this story, that can balance the equation of our pain—** ***RESURRECTION.***",1,2025-04-09 15:42:39+00:00,LOW,1.0,294.24350694444445,I watched God's Not Dead 5 so you don't have to -

For example, take something like the Lord of The Rings, tons of narrative, description, etc. The plot is engaging, there's tension and peril. 

Bible is completely different. First half of the Bible is a mish-mash of poetry and songs, ancient stories, etc. Most of it can be described as Man disobeys God, God punishes Man, God eventually redeems Man. Over and over again.

New Testament is a little different with the Gospels which I think are on the whole a little more readable like a typical story, but then we get into things like Paul's letters which are literally just Paul writing to different Churches and then we crescendo with Revelations which is a whole bunch of visions and prophecy.

There are a lot of films even from the 2010s that are no longer available because someone slipped up. It has nothing to do with the quality or type of film, it is just that the dice roll on their preservation was a critical failure.

Even films that are considered classics today were not thought that much of in the time of release, and are lost or hard to find materials for. Metropolis has been having newly-recovered footage added to it for at least half a century. The person who finds the original negative and audio of Humor Risk, a Marx Brothers film for crying out loud, will be a very rich person.

It really is not that much different with music. I was looking for a compilation recently that was basically full of punk, grindcore, and so forth. You can find half of it on YouChoob, but the full compilation can only be found on archive org. And there are other recordings that I would not know where to begin looking for. Mordor's Dark Is The Future seven inch is only available on YouChoob so far as I am aware. There is a relatively new recording from Larry Lifeless that is only available on YouChoob or vinyl.

- Listen to old music on good gear. Recently I've been re-listening to a bunch of old albums I loved when I was a teenager, except instead of listening to questionably-legal MP3s through cheapo Apple earbuds, I'm listening to lossless files through open-back reference headphones or a hifi setup. You'd be amazed how much of the old mojo comes back when you listen to the music that inspired you on genuinely good gear. It's like taking a beloved old movie you've only ever seen on a degraded VHS and watching it in 4K.
- Introspect. You talk about feeling like you don't have anything to say, but I think you're just not giving the things you *do* have enough credit. Maybe it doesn't feel as profound as it used to when you were younger and full of chutzpah, but that doesn't mean it's not meaningful. Hey Jude was Paul McCartney comforting John's son during his divorce, there wasn't some deep profound meaning, it was just ""My friend's son is sad because his parents are splitting up, I should try to cheer him up."" Limelight is dressed up in all Neil Peart's usual prose, but at its core it's just about being an introvert thrust into a spotlight and the anxiety that brings. Think about life, people you know, things you care about. It doesn't have to be complex, it can just be about the things we all go through in life at one point or another; relationships falling out, loving one's family, good times with friends, stress from work.
- Take in other media. Led Zeppelin wrote multiple songs that were odes to Tolkien. Metallica didn't even bother coming up with a new name for The Call of Kthulu, they just took the title and changed the C to a K. Blade Runner is an adaptation of a Philip K. Dick novel. West Side Story and The Lion King lean heavily on Shakespearean plays. Consume other media, and if something inspires you, make music about it.
- Embrace simple arrangements and productions. If you can only muster an hour or two of inspiration, adapt to work around that. Focus on making simple songs that you can largely finish while you have inspiration. It can be something as simple as two minutes of verse-chorus-verse-chorus with just guitar or keys, bass, drums, and a vocal/melody and nothing else. Basic EQ, panning, levels, and a little compression. It's not going to shine like a multimillion-dollar album from Abbey Road, but plenty of great songs have been more lofi than that. Hell, you can go even simpler, how many great songs have just been one take of an acoustic instrument and a voice? Whatever it takes to get a song into the window you have energy for. If all you can manage is ten pushups, do ten pushups. Eventually once that's easy, do 15. But embrace where you are before you lament where you used to be.

Palantir is bad news.

&gt;[Palantir \(the name comes from the crystal ball-like seeing stones from The Lord of the Rings, which could be used for communication and to know the past and the future\) was founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01972243.2022.2100851#d1e286) Initially based in Palo Alto, California, the company’s headquarters has since been relocated to Denver, Colorado. In its early years, Palantir received startup funding from the US Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel. In 2020, the company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the ticker PLTR via a direct listing, ending a 16-year run of private holdings and financial secrecy (Gregg and MacMillan Citation2020). Palantir’s most well-known clients include US police departments accused of using Palantir’s predictive policing and facial recognition technologies for racial profiling (Hvistendahl Citation2021) and US security agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which reports say Palantir assists with digitally tracking undocumented immigrants, including children, for deportation. For example, a raid on the workplace of 680 migrant workers in Mississippi on August 7, 2019, was “carried out by the unit of ICE that uses Palantir software to investigate potential targets and compile evidence against them” (MacMillan and Dwoskin Citation2019). Further, Palantir is reported to have had, as early as 2012, a “role in a far-reaching customs system,” following US Customs and Border Protection training documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Woodman Citation2016).

&gt;In addition to US policing and security agencies, Palantir’s clients include financial companies like JPMorgan Chase (Waldman, Chapman, and Robertson Citation2018) and humanitarian organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP)—the food-assistance branch of the UN—which Palantir assisted with distributing food supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic (Parker Citation2019). WFP received criticism for partnering with Palantir; in fact, several Palantir partners have also faced public pressure campaigns to dissociate with the company due to the firm’s controversial surveillance activities related to policing and immigration (Sherman Citation2020). WFP eventually clarified that its partnership would not include provision of data to Palantir and that neither would Palantir provide data to WFP (Porcari Citation2019). Palantir has likewise faced resistance from its employees, ranging from petitions to resignations over its work with ICE (Chafkin Citation2021). Like the New York Police Department (NYPD), other organizations have faced problems when attempting to secure their analytics data after ending contracts with Palantir (Alden Citation2017; Irani and Whitney Citation2020). Palantir is also litigious and adversarial with its customers; in 2016, the firm won a lawsuit against its client, the Pentagon, for a lucrative army contract worth $206 million (Davenport Citation2016).",2,2025-06-01 18:08:56+00:00,LOW,6.0,269.0934375,"Trump Hired Palantir To Create a Database on All Americans.

be79ced8-10aa-4355-9dd3-1591a959fc33,1ltmxnj,Buddhism,Hot4Scooter,"Buddhism is *still* primarily an oral tradition. The written material held to be *buddhavacana* (the Buddha's word) by the various lineages and the commentaries and compilations of later scholar practitioners all serve as a) the basis of oral Instruction and b) a representation of awakening in a way similar to how statues and stupas are representations of awakening. 


Until very recently with the rise of Protestant Christianity-inspired movements like those aiming to reconstruct Early Buddhism, no Buddhist tradition had a *sola scriptura*-like attitude to the transmission of knowledge. 


Imho, such an attitude wouldn't really make sense to begin with: the whole point of the Buddhist teachings is that the knowledge embodied in it is *not* solely accessible to the Buddha. Each and every being can come to the same insight. The kind of truth Buddhism purports to be is not like the truth or untruth of whether the Eagles could have flown Frodo to Mount Doom, which would have been up to Tolkien. It is like the truth or untruth of whether, at the same atmospheric pressure, pure water will always boil and freeze at the same temperatures. It is essentially a public type of knowledge. 


This also means that the oral tradition of Buddhism is constantly refreshed and corrected by the living experience of its practitioners. The written corpus doesn't only (attempt to) capture this living experience, but it also captures and ""fossilizes"" the biases and incomplete views of its compilers. 


Plus, when consuming written text, we're really primarily taking in *our own* interpretation of its words. We're liable to see all our biases and preferences reflected on the page. At least with a living, experienced teacher or spiritual friend, we have to opportunity to have it pointed out to us we're huffing our own farts. 


As some reflections. ",20,2025-07-07 08:17:23+00:00,LOW,1.0,288.55912037037035,Oral tradition vs written word

In the end, I have to put 2112 on top, due to the lyrical theme of the song.

Shortly thereafter, I bought the earlier three albums. I have always loved Fountain of Lamneth and didn’t understood. why the guys wouldn’t play it live. Later on, I learned the reason. I think 2112 still transcends FOL because it was so different from anything else before it. A lot of bands were writing songs that seemed like they could have been part of the Lord of the Rings or other fantasy adventures. 2112 was a breakthrough and, although other bands were dabbling with science fiction, Rush was able to put a finer point on it, make it edgy and reflective of things to come—it felt like it was way ahead of its time. It is still a brilliant piece of work, as is FOL.

Here is the official list. It's kind of insane because there's more songs here than some bands even have in their catalog. Also noticed that the songs noted that have been soundchecked have been verified by fans who were at shows or people who tried to bootleg or record on the outside before shows or during rehearsal shows before tours cuz Rush was always one to soundcheck They never did not perform a soundcheck. I once was outside the venue in Phoenix Arizona in 2007 and I had people on the sidewalk telling me we had to move or they were going to call the cops because we were trying to get a listen to the soundcheck and a woman security guard told me well they're not sound checking today they're not soundchecking today I'm like you're full of shit. They always sound check! I was 17 so I probably had a little more guts to say stuff like that. Don't give me that and then all the sudden you hear the sounds of Far Cry coming from the speakers of the pavilion. But I had to walk back and forth on the sidewalk to stay legal which was some of the dumbest shit I've ever experienced. This was the day I got a picture of Neil Pearts motorcycle as he arrived and he also went into this day in detail a little bit in his book because there was a helicopter crash the same day were two news helicopters collided in Phoenix due to them covering a police chase and also across the street from the venue a cop was shot and killed in a different incident. So they closed the parking lot and we had to stay in after the show until I found the guy basically or until they were satisfied that they weren't mingling amongst us rush fans It was crazy. Anyways here is the list as promised. Sorry for being long-winded.

If they just license a pre-existing story, like some fantasy or sci-fi novel, what do they do with it? Have the customer read it? Or watch the movie adaptation? Then all the customer gets to experience is their busted-ass, half-remembered version of it. Yippee.


Instead, they do what they did in the game and get authors on the cheap to come up with original stories. Sure, they're no Tolkien, but they come a hell of a lot cheaper and you can get it *exactly* as they imagined it, with no compromise or loss of fidelity.

From a technical standpoint, Polyphia could have Tim Henson sit out and likely play the entirety of Rush's catalog backwards and forwards, but you couldn't stand it because all you could hear would be virtuoso-level ego's drowning out any sense of melody, soul, or emotion(except perhaps ABC with Sophia Black, but she's carrying all the emotional water in that track).

I am a manager myself and agree with what you are saying about the corporate world in America tho in my experience there is a lot of different strata that dictate how this plays out. 

I work for a medium sized company now and while we have a share of managers I would classify as business idiots we do not have nearly as many as we did at my previous VERY large employer. At the medium sized companies I have worked for the distance from the results and the managers are very short so the executives have easy targets if the numbers are not going the way they want. Kind of an eye of Sauron thing. You gain the negative attention of the execs and suddenly you have orcs so far up your ass you’ll need a whole army of dwarves just to get them out. 

In the larger company the business idiot can flourish once they rise a director level or higher because there is usually several layers of flunky between themselves and the work. In fact I left this company as a senior but-not-director manager because the orders I was getting from my director made no sense. It was completely divorced from the reality of the work and it didn’t matter what I told her she just had it in her caw that we HAD TO do things a certain way. Of course it didn’t work and we reversed the decisions in the same quarter they were implemented. Did the Director have any negative repercussions? Fucking of course not. 

Later this same company started to make internal waves by restructuring a number of departments. Not layoffs but the career path for upward movement. They even hosted a roundtable discussion with senior leadership to sell it to the middle managers and Individual Contributors. 

Reader, I was a corporate skeptic prior to this event but this was my Paul on the road to Damascus and scales falling from my eyes moment. The complete and utter incompetency and inability to imagine what life must be for anyone who was not a director or higher was astonishing. It was immediately clear to me that they did not have any idea what they were doing and I was witnessing a game of idiot telephone: they had received an order from a president, who had received it from an executive, who had received it from the board, who got the idea because they were talking to a friend who was also on a board somewhere and was able to shuffle things around and squeeze out a few more bucks on their dividends. 

It was not about good management, it was not about taking care of people, it was not about taking care of the customers. It was parroting the idea of an idea with no real plan and often active disdain for the people impacted by it. 

I am now a director as at a medium sized company and I do the same work (on a smaller scale) as my ICs. I started off doing this temporarily until I hired more staff but decided a few months in that it was better this way. I am not saying I am immune from Idiot Manager syndrome but I do think I have a good handle on what daily life is like for all my employees and how I can make sure that their job is as enjoys as labor can be. I probably have an upper limit to my title because my motivation is taking care of my employees and not amplifying the bottom line at any cost. Funny thing about that though is that my numbers are 10x better than my predecessor who had everyone in the office way after hours and was constantly taking work home and asking them to work on weekends. I ended that shit as soon as I started. I treat them like adults and they act accordingly. 

The business idiot does not view workers below them on the org chart as adults or even people capable of making their own decisions. They are merely seen as children who must be monitored at all times and condescended. Their logic, as I understand it, is that if they were smarter and more capable they would already be an MBA and wouldn’t be “stuck” in the lower rung of the corporate ladder. Which in turn is how the elite view everyone who has to work for a paycheck. 

The business idiot is the natural byproduct of this entire rotten American ecosystem. It is a system that actively rewards dominance, extraction, exploitation, and dehumanization. It is a system that punishes or keeps at arms length equality, humane treatment, or sustainability. It is truly rotten to the core.

You have read for learning purposes, you are in school or were in school, so you should understand the basic setup of a novel and how it works. 

At that point, as long as you are physically writing, sharing your work, accepting feedback, and practicing your craft, then you should be fine.

I feel like people in this sub place an inflated importance on reading, treating it like a cure-all to knowing how to write...however my stance is and always will be: reading is important, but at the end of the day, to learn to write you need to write. 

Beyond that, it seems as though you are exploring a passion for writing in a way that is accessible to you. I have adhd as well, and while I dont mind reading (my flavor of adhd tends to hyperfixate, so like entire books in a day type shit), I can understand how sitting down and reading an entire book can be daunting. The process of deep diving specific sections and understanding the writing on a more personal basis is probably a better use of your time anyways, especially from a writing standpoint.

Dont listen to the people who uncritically say ""oh no, youre doomed, you need to read to write"" as it is boiling down a craft that is a lot more complex than just ""read tolkien a few times and youll get it""

It is more complex than that, and as with everything, people learn in different ways.

Many marijuana enthusiasts often see their favorite movies as being told from the perspective of a stoner. This led me to ponder what The Hobbit would be like if Tolkien toked a gravity bong and rewrote it while his senses were up in smoke. If you don't partake in the devil’s lettuce, don’t worry, you'll still enjoy what I have to say. For those of you who do, enjoy my thought process.

Let's start with our homie, Bilbo. He's one of the most stoner stoners out there. He lives in a small house cluttered with cool stuff. It's surrounded by lush greenery and very hippie-like. Not only that, but his only goal is to chill while enjoying snacks, and he refuses to get involved in the chaotic outside world. Most smokers will usually get pulled into non-food adventures by their extroverted, non-smoking friends. Enter Gandalf. He visits our boy Bilbo only to get smoked out, which helps him conclude that Smaug needs to be defeated. The THC does the work in helping him realize that once Sauron returns, Smaug will eventually become his ally to help destroy Middle Earth. Not cool. The wizard does his best to talk Bilbo into coming on an adventure, but B is not having it. He loads Gandalf up with the finest “pipeweed” and sends him on his way.

While puffing away, he runs into the dwarves who come up with a plan to rob a dragon. Gandalf is like, ""BRO! I've got an idea!"" Because he smells like a skunk, they're reluctant, but they listen intently because dwarves love to steal shit. The grey wizard explains they need to meet him at Bilbo’s house to get him to tag along. ""You want us to stop by and convince your dealer to come with us?"" they ask. Gandalf is like, ""Nah dude, he's not only my dealer, he’s also the best thief that ever thieved."" So the dwarves are like, ""Hell yeah, what better way to steal from a dragon than by having an actual thief! Baller, let's roll."" Gandalf talks them into going without him because he remembers he has some wizard business to attend to first, so he'll meet them along the way.

When they arrive at Bilbo’s house, they find him doing what he does best: smoking it up and preparing a delicious snack. He wasn't prepared for guests, but like most potheads, he welcomes them in. At this point, Bilbo doesn't want to roll up that many joints, so he does the most economical way to get his guests high. He hotboxes them in his hobbit hole. That backfires a bit as they get the super munchies and eat all his snacks. Bilbo unknowingly does the thing that actually convinces him to come on the journey. Since he's completely out of snacks, he now has a reason to leave home.

So off they go to steal stuff from the dragon, but in true stoner fashion, they get super lost along the way, and nothing goes to plan. They run into a classic pothead villain: jocks as portrayed by the Trolls. Fear not, Bilbo uses his gardening skills to talk the trolls into delaying eating them by starting a smoke sesh. He manages to get them talking about the many different ways they could cook up their meal. Why have a dry, unseasoned dwarf-dog, when you can have a roasted cheesy gordita hobbit crunch wrap supreme? They spend so much time passing a joint around that morning hits and they're too stoned to eat and pass out. More shenanigans occur, but they eventually make it to the Misty Mountain.

At this point, Gandalf shows back up and adds another layer to their quest. He reminds Thorin that Smaug is responsible for his ancestors losing the mountain to begin with. He's like, ""Bro, that dragon kilt your kinfolk. We should blast him."" Thorin, being the scrapper that he is, agrees. ""Hell yeah, I'm gonna square up and knock that foo out."" So Bilbo finds the ring, right, and Smeagol wants to reclaim it. Being the clever pot connoisseur he is, Bilbo gets into a battle of wits with Smeagol with the ring going to the winner. As clever as Smeagol is, our hippie hobbit is far more clever and wins the contest.

Now it's time to sneak around and eventually fight Smaug. Problem is, Bilbo is carrying some dank nugs so Smaug is able to smell him even when he uses the ring to become invisible. They eventually beat the dragon and are able to reclaim the mountain and all its riches. That triggers the IRS (humans) to call in the cops. The DEA (Elves) are also called in because word has gotten around about Bilbo supplying all of Middle Earth. He's become such a big player in the game that even some local gangs show up (Orcs), and we get the battle of five armies. Thorin and his gang knuckle up, and everyone scraps. The dust settles, and our heroes part ways. Bilbo returns to find his stuff being auctioned off, so he uses his newfound courage to reclaim his stuff. In the end, Bilbo gets to go back to doing what he loves: hanging out in his hobbit hole, eating snacks, and blazing the finest Hobbiton honey any beekeeper would have the pleasure of smoking. Only this time, he's occasionally visited by his new homies so they can reminisce and pour one out for their fallen brethren.

There you have it, my stoner take on The Hobbit. It helped me realize that The Lord of the Rings was another story about class warfare and how the wealthy elites wanted power but were only able to accomplish their goals on the backs of the working class. Think about it: Saruman used poor orcs who owned nothing to do his fighting, and Sam, being the only working-class bloke, literally carried Frodo to the top and eventually helped him reach his goal. Anyway, happy 4/20, everyone.",2,2025-04-20 13:51:33+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.0,The Higher Shire

*Hobbit*, like everyone else.

*The Dying Earth*. Set off its own subgenre at the time, and just a fun read about wizards and mad scientists in a post apocalyptic world.

*The Broken Sword.* Easily the second best/most influential book of 1955. A Viking epic for a modern American audience, complete with tragedy, pagan and Christian values colliding, and a tour of elves in Northern Europe

*Elric of Melninone*. The OG Edgelord. What if Conan was weak, and the Broken Sword were evil? Intended as a rejection of Tolkein and the clones publishers had been seeking, and this novella is a short 165 pages. 

Dragonriders of Pern (at least the first trilogy). Skip the intro, it's a fairly standard fantasy-world with its own quirks, but the characters discover more and more about where they came from as they unite the 'kingdom' to fight an extraterrestrial threat.

Magic of Recluce. Slow burn, not a ton of action in the first half, but manages to marry the small-scale sword and sorcery vibe with epic worldbuilding by the end. Wasn't as big on Towers of Sunset, but I'll get around to continuing Lerris' story eventually.

Guards, Guards. It's just fun. I like Men at Arms better, and Night Watch is more relevant currently, but this is first in the series and I'd recommend all of them so the first one goes here.

Icewind Dale Trilogy. My first five recs were all in Appendix N. Dragonlance were the first DND novels to really break through, but they felt like a novelization of someone else's campaign (because they were), whereas Icewind Dale just feels like an adventure in FaeRûn.

I believe I but 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s with different styles and sub genres. Earthsea and Empire of the East/Books of Swords get honorable mentions.

I’m not what you would call a traditional Led Zeppelin fan, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I think I can offer some perspective on what killed them. I grew up listening to them. You couldn’t escape them on LA radio at the time but they were the band my older brother loved and went to see. Bonham died when I was in middle school and I couldn’t have cared less. The minute I found out the Clash existed, I didn’t want to know about Zeppelin anymore. 

We all hated them in the punk scene of course and some of that was definitely posturing. More than a few of us probably still liked them on the down low, but a lot of the animus toward them was entirely deserved in my opinion. They were still hugely popular at that time and  probably could have continued selling out shows into the early 80’s but frankly, they were yesterday’s papers by then. Those later pictures of them in the suits and skinny ties are just sad to look at and their music wasn’t exactly setting the world on fire either. A lot of kids my age then just didn’t want to hear anything more from a bunch of middle aged men flying around on a private jet, singing about lemons and the Lord of the Rings. They looked and sounded very dated and regardless of whether or not Bonham had died, I think they were pretty well done. Obviously there were a lot of other factors working against them but  I don’t think the 80’s would have been kind to them. I’m glad they didn’t go on because I think it would have had a high probability of being terrible and embarrassing. 

One only has to look at Jimmy Page to imagine what kind of a shit show a post 1980 Zeppelin might have looked like. He definitely wasn’t  serving “dark lord of rock n roll” in the looks department by the time the 80’s rolled around. If anything, he looked like a sweaty, low rent hot tub salesman with a drugstore box perm. The mystique was long gone. As far as his post-Zepplin musical output, no offense to people who liked the Firm or his solo album or whatever, but there was nothing revolutionary or innovative going on with him. And don’t even get me started on him hooking up with that dude from fucking Whitesnake. You could maybe argue that he would have done something more interesting with the other members of Zeppelin but I kind of doubt it and I don’t think the other members were gonna stick around much longer to find out. Maybe if he hadn’t been such a hopeless, insufferable junkie things might have been different but it’s hard to say. Jimmy Page strikes me as someone living in the past, whereas the other two have gone on to do interesting things. Page is of course one of the greatest guitar players to ever live and he’ll always be iconic but in my opinion, he started sliding downhill before I even finished elementary school and he’s never come back from that. 

Anyway, I hope I didn’t come off as shitting on everyone’s favorite band. Just wanted to share my perspective as a “non fan”  on them. I’m glad I was finally able to put aside my former hatred of them in the past few years and enjoy their music and very interesting legacy.",3,2025-06-22 20:27:08+00:00,LOW,1.0,60.7293287037037,What really killed Led Zeppelin?

This comes across as little more than 'my dad is stronger than your dad' which makes sense - neither side ever admits their guy would loose!

I'm a terrible representative of course, but I imagine that's how the vast majority of people seem this thing, and that's how the vast majority of powers scalers treat it.

Concepts without evidence = speculation.

Calling something a “foundational concept” doesn’t elevate it above scrutiny — it just means it’s central to a belief system. But if it lacks empirical support, then by definition, it remains speculative.

You can deeply believe in a concept. You can build entire traditions and cultures around it. But belief and foundational status do not transform it into fact. They just make it widespread speculation.

&gt; The Qur'an describes this world, the Dunya, as fleeting, asserting, ""And indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the [true] life, if only they knew""

And the Silmarillion describes Valinor as the Island of the Blessed, the Undying Lands across the sea, where sorrow does not dwell and time flows differently.

In other words: beautifully written fiction with deep emotional resonance, but no more evidence behind it than any religious text.

If I was to give you a premise and told you to tell give me a genre for ""space wars"" you would confidently put it in the science fiction genre. Using the really basic logic of space dogfights between alien races really is fiction, and it really is science.

If you were to ask 99% of the planet to put Star Wars in a genre, they would firmly place it in the Science Fiction genre. I'd also argue people would look at you funny if you tried to place it in the same catagory as LoTR. It's a really pedantic argument that the setting is worthless and we should only ever explore the theme.

It's a bit like claiming Dune is not a science fiction book because the Bene Gesserit are basically superpowered space Nuns and Spice is a bit like magic. Sure, we've got a lot of different themes in Dune to explore, but its set in a space faring world, where AI is banned, human computers exist, and a man turns into a giant worm. If we then agree that Dune is a sci-fi book(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science\_Fiction:\_The\_100\_Best\_Novels if you don't take it up with literary critics), then it makes sense that we also call Star Wars, the contemporary homage, a sci-fi too.",0,2025-09-07 18:45:51+00:00,LOW,3.0,354.4980092592593,Top3Ever Sci-Fi Movies 🚀✨

I'm not talking about ""some concepts not being Scifi"", I'm saying the fundament of Star Wars is not rooted in Scifi. This is where your comparison with Dune falls flat: The foundational concepts of Dune are questions of humanity, religion and power - very much Scifi! 

You're misunderstanding what my point is here: Lightsaber, space battles and space nuns aren't what defines a literature genre. It's the fundamental concepts behind the superficial set dressings. And that's the point about Star Wars: There is no higher concept but the battle between good and evil. Which is totally fine! But that just barely satisfies the definition of Scifi.

Talked about DNA symbols of the 4 basic nucleotides ATCG vs 1 &amp; 0 of Joi’s makeup, K: “half as much but twice as elegant”

Talked about not telling the “madam” truth

K: “There’s nothing to tell”

Joi: “6,10 and 21?” flips wooden horse in her hand to show harved date

Joi: “Coincidence?”

K: “A dangerous coincidence” 

Joi:“I always knew you were special, maybe this is how. A child, woman born, pushed into the world, wanted, loved”

K:“Well if it were true, I’ll be hunted by someone just like me for the rest of my life”

Joi:“It’s ok to dream a little, isn’t it?”

1:13 Joe discovered the wooden horse in the stove of the orphanage 

1:22 Joe confronts Stella, grunts, no words explicitly exchanged to suggest he is the missing child.

Joe got arrested, failed baseline, let go, great sex,

1:33 Joi wanted to go on the run with Joe, asked him to delete her from home unit, also break off antenna of the emanator, Luv got alerted.

They never explicitly said that Joe is that missing child in any conversation. 

Even if Luv tapped their conversation in the DNA room, there’s no actual evidence that Joe was potentially that boy.

Everything played out in visuals and without disposition. Which is why this is such a masterpiece that the general public failed to exercise their brain to connect dots.

K has told Joi about his dream of the orphanage horse story many times previously before buying her the emanator, and he also told Joshi when ordered. That alone didn’t trigger Wallace suspicion because everyone assumed (correctly) it’s planted memory.

Nothing incriminating was expressed in words, without seeing the scenes it’s not possible to draw conclusion like the audience can. Joi, like all AI, says what the algorithm calculates what K most likely wants to hear. Her conversation with K is a brilliant way for K to narrate his inner voice, which would be impossible to show as part of a visual story telling. That conversation in the DNA archive is basically his inner questioning and debates. Try tap into that. Jim Carrey’s Truman said it eloquently “You are not in my head!” The only way to film someone’s inner thinking is to try find a conduit, like Peter Jackson’s brilliant scene of Gollum and Sméagol debating whether to kill Frodo in his sleep.


Even so, a lot audiences failed to see it through. The fact that K’s memory was headlined by a girl with full head of hair (all boys had shaved hair) was missed by a lot of the audiences goes to show what a brilliant script this film has. It doesn’t hold your hand through the plot. It expects you to pay attention to the images it presents to you.

What I worry about is untethered AI, and I deeply believe that all such products or material produced using or actively relying on need to always be labeled as such, and more than just some digital watermark or metadata, like some permanent asterisk or footnote marker that cannot be used for self-promotional purpose or branding, just something as benign yet easily recognizable and understandable as a period or the @ symbol (which itself could be a pre-existing character stand-in). 

Apparently, there is indeed a push to do just that, to create an easily identifiable, universal symbology, and some designers have taken to using an eye reminiscent of the CBS logo with the letters AI in the pupil, or just the letter A itself.  

While I think the eye design naturally brings your own attention to it, it’s also a bit ominous, reminiscent of Orwell’s 1984 and the modern surveillance state or the Eye of Sauron, which just naturally brings up Palantir, which is perhaps an accurate level of foreboding, even if that’s not the designer intent.

Whatever symbology humanity decides upon, even just typing “AI” or its local language equivalent, I think it should clearly label as such, and that the programmers don’t program their systems for creepy, cruel or otherwise invasive or manipulative purposes without putting themselves on the hook.  We cannot allow the AI systems to absolve their owners and programmers of liability, same as with a self-driving vehicle or directions that might take you off an out bridge.",8,2025-07-11 20:43:32+00:00,LOW,4.0,304.21547453703704,Elon Musk Facing Possible Lawsuit After Grok AI Posts Detail How It Would Rape X User

I think 10 years old was around the time I did Hooked on Phonics (not diagnosed until 30s, no support or special education past elementary school). I was struggling to read out loud and I think it just didn't make me like reading as a result (It was too hard). After I did phonics, I suddenly became a big reader! Reading to this day is a big hyper focus of mine.

But in school, I didn't get to pick the books we read. I didn't like to read for class, I wanted to pick out something I was interested in (Not about some boy starving in the desert, boring!). However, to this very day, I read the ending before reading the middle. I have to know that all that reading/context is worth it! Even a good mystery, I was more about the story than being surprised at the end. (Hate surprises...). I have not read a single book gifted to me that I did not first pick out myself.

Might I suggest going to the library and asking her to pick out a book to either read with her out loud or to read herself? My parents read The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe series and Lord of the Rings out loud to me and my siblings! I think that was helpful in sparking my interest in stories.

As far as academics, I don't have much for you other than math tutoring. I was particularly bad at multiplication tables and tutored for a few weeks in 4th grade. I'm decent at math now, but I was unconventional throughout school (which isn't always encouraged at school). My geometry teacher in 11th grade was the first math teacher that just got me, he told my parents that I always find the easiest way to solve a problem (even if it's not part of the week's lesson!). Algebra was a subject that I deliberately forgot about the why and just did the problem simply.

Then 15 or so years ago when I found out that a sequel to my favorite movie was in the works, I knew it would not have the same feel as the original. What I wanted was noisy CRT monitors, buzzing neon signs, flickering fluorescent tubes, bulky electronics, and vidphones. To stay true to that 1980's vision of the future. But knowing Hollywood, I knew that a sequel would not capture the same feel. I expected there to be explosions, a flying car chase, smartphones, holograms, and Rick Deckard. 2049 gave us what I expected. There were some aspects I liked about 2049, such as the imaginary girlfriend to act as the Replicant Blade Runner's emotional cushion. But considering the labor of love that Alien: Romulus was to emulate the look and feel of the first two Alien movies, it's unfortunate that 2049 didn't do the same. It took video game creators to teach Hollywood that it's okay to stay true to the original ambience when the Alien: Isolation game came out.

As for this new effort, I applaud the idea of keeping it closer to the original film since 2049 failed to do so.

Like to give you an example I was in class with the same people for years thru elementary/middle school and I only became *close friends with them after…… five or so years of knowing each other because the lotr movies came out and all three of us were into it and then we stayed friends but before then we were cordial/were good but we weren’t FRIENDS if you get what I mean.

For instance, Hollywood could repackage ""premieres"" of its classic movies. In VR, you could go to 2001: A space Odyssey premiere and see half the people leave the theater in disgust and the other half being mesmerized by the beauty of it. You could go see the Lord of the rings surrounded by a bunch of in character geeks or Star wars, etc ..

Eventually you could also step into the movie and see things from Skywalker's or James bond perspective or your own.

I can see something like this happening. Legacy human entertainment will have to change and might get a second wind like this.

He's open sourcing a system than can use a joystick, but there's a hack to feed the score in. He's hit a wall with finding intrinsic reward, hence his AI being disabled by a tablecloth misplaced. His approach may have been interesting 4 years ago, but now its shown as too difficult an initial hump for a baby AI to get over imo. 

You need to bootstrap from language, into RL for socializing, then into self rewarding behavior, so the LLM can modify its own weights and reward function as training progresses, with some idea as to what should be an appropriate reward for itself from the RL step. None of these steps were obvious, but through groping in the dark we made progress. 

Likely, we could bootstrap from facial expressions as well: a smile as reward. Babies start to smile, and to look for smiles, very quickly. It's hardwired. If your parent doesn't smile at you as a baby, you get fucked up quick. I know this from my own experience. Of course, training a neural net from smiles from the get go is probably too big a step... like with LLMs, we bootstrap from Youtube videos for world knowledge, into RL from smiles for development and socializing, then into real world tasks, such as self replication. It's analogous to time in the womb, when sense data is begun to be taken in, then time with nurturing parents, then time playing with other kids.

AlphaGo was amazing, but it's never going to be more than a game playing robot. To get Data from Star Trek, we gotta hew closer to how Humanity comes to be. Of course, I could be wrong in the end, but the recent years show me this path is correct. The next step is getting kids to play together, and generate their own rewards. Some kind of socializing should ensure we don't end up with a Melkor, Tolkien's big villain, on their own, looking for strange things after generating a weird reward function.",6,2025-07-04 16:00:20+00:00,LOW,2.0,335.5377314814815,"John Carmack (the creator of Doom) Reveals AGI Future: Robots, Videogames and AI Agents..."

Between biological immortality and actual FDVR, the former might actually be a little bit closer to achieve.

FDVR, the actual version and not a pale imitation would require an understanding of the human body to a extremely high degree. Safely paralyzing a person without harm or discomfort while keeping the brain running normally and rerouting all sensory imput and movement output to a computer.

If you have the medical knowledge to do that, its hard to believe significantly increasing human lifespan is not yet on the table.

.

As for what you can do when inside of FDVR, well, its a fictional world. Anything you can think of you can model a world after.

I do personally that you need to treat it like a movie. And i mean in the sense that you should focus on setting and story above just getting everything you want from the start.

Think of it this way, the only movies that are both good and where the protagonist is all powerfull and gets everything he want...... are comedies.

What makes it so accessible, what gives it that immediacy

Also I like how in early childhood books. It's often one sentence per page. I actually do that a lot. I use one sentence in its own space or line. I'm intrigued by this art of writing.

no other art form polices age like this. It’s cultural, not artistic

Basically theres:

Misplaced fears about adult presence near children (understandable, but often overcorrective)

Assumptions that children’s media is only for kids (false)

A lack of imagination around literature as a shared human medium

I’m just browsing and reading. I don’t think this makes an entire library section about me. 

An adult reading YA or childrens isn’t a regression. Its like research.
And not just research, but emotional investigation. You’re looking at:

What makes a sentence feel safe

What kind of pacing opens the heart

How one line can carry weight like a whole chapter

This is the same reason people cry at Pixar, and why some books marketed for children are iconic like The Hobbit. 

I just wonder if theres some way, conversationally, to approach this situation.

I elaborated a bit more in a comment above.. 

I mention The Hobbit.. as a childrens book, loved by all ages, also with particularly interesting literary technique, Tolkien achieves a really distinct narrative voice in this one…

Why should anyone feel unwelcome to read that? Or browse in that genre?

Is it truly unsafe for a marginalized teen because across the room there’s some person launching a literary investigation into CS lewis? Or Judy Bloom?

I think part of the issue is the cultural assumption that one person is going to come along and magically fix everything. To me that's just a different shade of learned helplessness, it might be slightly less than just sitting out as a non vote. Gandalf is not about to ride down into Hell's keep and save us all from our own cultural passivity. 


Here's what I would advocate for: 
- dive into the boring side of the candidates policy, not just who has the best social media memes. 
- have conversations and be vocal in opposing stereotypes like 'I'm a fiscal conservative so I'm voting Republican'. Most barely informed people know that most the debt has come from trump and that Republicans are not fiscally conservative. They usually say this though because it's socially safer than the real reason they wanted to vote for Trump. 
- vote in local elections, not just national
- don't wait to fall in love with a candidate to vote for them. Politics should be a little boring. 
- push back on double standards that come up
- show up at protests and actually discuss these issues, be willing to learn from others and put yourself out there. ",2,2025-06-20 14:48:40+00:00,LOW,1.0,212.92798611111112,How do you all feel about Bernie? Others?

The books were written by people who were, at the very least, knowledgeable about the events in the books and the places described. Compare it to something like the Quran, which can't even accurately describe Jerusalem. The books were also written mere decades after the resurrection of Christ, and tradition has long held for nearly two thousand years that the gospels were written by those who they are attributed to (actual eyewitnesses, disciples, and apostles). The gospels aren't trying to tell you a mere story, they're trying to spread the good news of salvation to you. They're making a historical claim that Jesus of Nazareth was crucified, died, and was buried, and rose again on the 3rd day.

All but one of the apostles gave their lives and were martyred for this. They were hunted and persecuted for decades before being brutally murdered. They refused to recant what they said. They died for the truth of their message: that God became incarnate in his Son, Jesus Christ, and died for our sins on the cross as was prefigured and prophesied in the Old Testament. The claims that were made were historical in nature. It wasn't a fiction book like Lord of the Rings that people picked up a few hundred years later and mistook as history. I used to think that this was the case, until I started looking into it. This is absolutely not what happened. And practically every single scholar with a PhD in a relevant field says that Jesus Christ was a real person.

So, at the very least, the New Testament isn't that. The Old Testament is a little more difficult at times because we're more removed from it in history. A lot of what was written about in it actually did happen. The various wars. We even have evidence of particular battles attested to by surrounding cultures. A lot of the Old Testament is written more like a historical book trying to relate to future generations what had happened. They aren't propaganda, for instance. David was a real king, and the books do not make him look like a saint, for instance. They don't paint the Hebrews as a perfect people. They don't tell you that they won every single battle they ever fought. They're written much more like history.

Of course, at times, there are particular stories, and those ones would be hard/impossible to verify if they actually happened. We're so far removed from them that there's really no way to know with certainty. But the idea that the Bible as a whole was just a bunch of fables that people mistook as real falls apart when you delve into the history. But it's a common idea for sure, and it's something I used to think when I was super skeptical.

1. Hell and God’s Love

I struggled a lot with the idea of hell too, especially the thought that someone might be punished forever for just being born in the “wrong place.” But what helped me was reframing what the Church actually teaches. The Catechism says:

“God predestines no one to go to hell.” (CCC 1037)

God doesn’t “send” people to hell arbitrarily—hell is ultimately the freely chosen separation from God. If someone persistently refuses grace, love, truth, and goodness throughout their life, God respects that freedom—even if it breaks His heart.

As for those who never heard the Gospel: the Church teaches that God judges us based on the light we’ve been given (Romans 2:14-16). In other words, people aren’t condemned for ignorance or geography. God is perfectly just and perfectly merciful. We can trust that He gives everyone a real chance, even if it’s not through ordinary means.

2. Contradictions in the Bible

You’re absolutely right that the Bible has challenging passages and apparent contradictions. I don’t think it’s intellectually honest to pretend they’re not there.

But the Catholic view of Scripture is nuanced. We don’t believe the Bible is a word-for-word transcript of history or science. Instead, it’s a divinely inspired library—a collection of different genres, authors, and theological perspectives written over centuries. Just like you’d expect eyewitness accounts to differ in detail while agreeing on the main event, the Gospels reflect different theological emphases, not necessarily contradictions in the core message.

Matthew and Luke having different genealogies? They’re tracing different theological themes. The Passion accounts differing? That’s not fabrication—it’s what happens when real people remember and interpret life-altering events.

And honestly, if the Gospels were identical, critics would accuse them of collusion. The variety supports the idea that these are authentic, ancient testimonies trying to express a mystery too big to reduce to bullet points.

3. Historical Doubts about Jesus

You mentioned that nothing was written about Jesus for 70 years, but that’s not accurate. Scholars agree that Paul’s letters (e.g. 1 Corinthians) were written within 20–25 years of Jesus’ death, and the Gospels within 30–60 years. That’s incredibly fast by ancient historical standards.

As for the 500 witnesses to the resurrection: Paul was writing this to people who could have gone and checked. He’s essentially saying, “You don’t believe me? Ask around.” If it were a made-up story, it probably wouldn’t have gained traction in a world that was deeply skeptical and hostile to the Christian message.

And to your point that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I agree. But I also think it’s extraordinary that a small group of terrified disciples, whose leader was executed in shame, suddenly became bold enough to face martyrdom for proclaiming He rose from the dead. Something happened. And I believe it wasn’t just a hallucination or myth.

4. The Problem of Evil and Suffering

This is the hardest one and I won’t pretend to have a neat answer.

Why would a loving God allow kids to die, or animals to suffer, or people to go through trauma they didn’t choose? I’ve wept over these things. I still do.

But here’s what keeps me believing:
	•	Christianity doesn’t offer an abstract solution to suffering, it gives us a suffering God. Jesus doesn’t watch from afar; He enters our pain, bleeds with us, and dies unjustly on a cross. That doesn’t explain why suffering exists, but it changes how we bear it. We’re not alone in it.
	•	The “soul-making” theodicy you mentioned isn’t perfect. But it points to something real: our deepest virtues of courage, compassion, forgiveness are only possible in a world where suffering exists. God doesn’t cause evil, but He brings meaning out of it. As Tolkien said, “Everything sad is going to come untrue.”

And when I see the faces of people who’ve endured incredible suffering and still radiate love and faith (think of people like Viktor Frankl or Jean Vanier), it makes me believe this world is a place where souls are made for something eternal.


You might still disagree with all of this. That’s okay. But I just wanted to say: you’re not crazy for asking these questions. And belief in God isn’t just about plugging our ears to avoid tough answers. For me, it’s about trust that behind this confusing, painful, beautiful world is a Creator who didn’t give up on us, even when we gave up on Him.

And if you’re ever open to rediscovering Jesus as a Person I think you’ll find He can handle every one of your doubts with gentleness and strength.

I’d clean my desk or bedroom and come up with an organizational strategy, but it never stuck and I was back to chaos within a couple of weeks. (This tracks with my attempts to organize things as an adult as well. I’m the queen of organizing projects that do nothing to keep me organized). Neither I nor my parents saved things like planners, but if we had and you looked at my homework planner at any age, you would see a week or two of everything written down and neatly organized…then nothing for months. Then another attempt that lasted a week or two, then nothing for two more months, etc etc. (Again, tracks as an adult - though I do much better with digital calendars.)

I was a HUGE daydreamer. As a young child, I had imaginary friends with very elaborate backstories. I learned early that people think you’re crazy for having imaginary friends, so I kept it secret. I never had any problems understanding social expectations - it was always very clear to me that there were some times/places I could interact with my imagination and other times/places when it needed to stay in my head. When I was along or playing outside, I chattered extensively to my imaginary friends, but in situations where I was expected to remain quiet (school, church, when adults were talking), I daydreamed. When I couldn’t sleep, I made up long stories - either about my imaginary friends or about characters in books. When I got older, I started writing them down (I beat Peter Jackson to writing a screenplay for LOTR, lol - 11yo me had that done in like 1994, though I’ll concede that his was MUCH better). I still concoct stories constantly, they’re a huge hyperfocus thing for me. (I’ve never published anything, mostly because I never end up finishing them)

I appeared to be a good student, mostly because I was smart enough to coast through school without actually trying very hard. I often did papers the night before and homework in the morning before school. When I got to college and actually had to learn to study, I quickly focused my coursework on subjects that interested me, went to graduate school, and work in a very specialized niche field that interests me…so all of this checks out. I am successful professionally…because I work in a very niche field that happens to interest me and because I can hyper focus in my work. 

I was seen as responsible, but I didn’t have any choice in the matter. I was the eldest of four kids and expected to be the responsible one. When I didn’t meet my mom’s expectations about being responsible, even in ways that were typical for my age, she came down very hard on me for not paying close enough attention or forgetting things, so I had to find ways to adapt. I think that’s how I went undiagnosed for so long.

In the sense of “my book is better than yours, your bible is full of contradictions.” That can work, since both sides believe in a books superiority over factual statements or real life evidence. 

But from an atheists standpoint, this is BS. I don’t believe in your book to begin with, proving that your book is the most superior among other “Books” 
(which I also don’t believe in)wouldn’t change my perspective of your religion.

883baa41-34e9-44f7-a466-28ec89fa6bb0,1lzodzu,EyesOnIce,CantStopPoppin,"On Monday, July 14, 2025, a group of activists gathered outside Palantir Technologies' office in New York City, chanting ""No ICE, No Palantir!"" in a bold protest against the company's $30 million contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The demonstration, captured and shared by Oliya Scootercaster on X (formerly Twitter), saw protesters blocking the entrance to Palantir's W 18th Street location, leading to several arrests as police intervened.

This action is part of a broader wave of anti-ICE protests sweeping the nation, fueled by concerns over Palantir's role in developing ""ImmigrationOS,"" a surveillance platform designed to track self-deportations in near real-time. The contract, detailed in a Wired report from April 18, 2025 \[1\], has sparked outrage among activists who argue that it exacerbates the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, targeting immigrant communities and undermining civil liberties.

The protest reflects growing resistance to Palantir's deep involvement with ICE, a relationship that dates back to 2011 and has expanded significantly under the current administration. As tensions rise, with recent clashes in Los Angeles and other cities, the demonstration in New York underscores the demand for accountability and a reevaluation of the ethical implications of such technological collaborations. The arrests and ongoing activism highlight the persistent struggle against policies perceived as hostile to immigrant rights and privacy.

Peter Thiel, a co-founder of Palantir Technologies, has been a significant figure in the tech and venture capital landscape. His company's data analytics and surveillance capabilities, often contracted by government agencies, have drawn criticism, particularly from activist groups protesting against ICE's policies. According to Wikipedia \[2\], Thiel launched Palantir in 2003, naming it after the Tolkien artifact, and has been its chairman since inception. Palantir's work with ICE, as reported by Wired \[1\], includes providing near real-time data on self-deportations, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties.

This controversy is compounded by the broader debate surrounding facial recognition technologies, such as those developed by Clearview AI. Clearview AI, despite claims of no institutional relationship with the New York Police Department (NYPD) as stated in a Forbes article from September 4, 2024 \[3\], has faced scrutiny for its use by law enforcement. The company's technology, which matches faces to a vast database of images, has raised privacy concerns and led to legal challenges, including lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and fines in the European Union for violating privacy laws, as detailed in a Regulatory Oversight article from April 30, 2025 \[4\].

The intersection of these technologies and their use by government agencies has fueled protests and debates about surveillance, civil liberties, and the role of private companies in public policy, as highlighted by the recent actions against Palantir and the broader context of anti-ICE sentiments.

If you don't like smoking, vaping is an option for similar quick onset. I much prefer flower to literally anything else now - I just feel like it's cleaner and happier, but that could just be me. You might start to love the smell though.

Here is the thing about edibles... When you smoke weed you get instant THC in your bloodstream. When you eat it, your body converts it to 11-hydroxy which takes more time and actually is more powerful, more intense high and longer lasting. My dispensary has what is called ""nano technology"" edibles that do not convert to 11, so they hit you in like 15 minutes and are similar to smoking. I like those the most. Lastly, I suggest getting edibles labeled as ""full spectrum"" or ""rosin"" based. This means you don't just get THC, but the entire profile of the plant, which (again, in my mind) seems to be a cleaner and happier high.

I might suggest you look into drinks. I used to love some hemp based drinks. One company called Levity makes ""liquor"" alternatives with THC that I actually used to cut down a lot on drinking alcohol myself. A lot of companies out there, but I knew these guys personally, but other brands are good too - just research the testing and quality... Ohh, and since you are new, maybe try 2.5mg at first, then move to 5mg - if it's not enough you can slowly bump up.

It’s the thing that makes humanity different from every other known life form. We have a shared collective memory that we and an understanding of cultural history. 

Creating truly seminal art in a complete vacuum is impossible. Even people who are best known for breaking new ground still *learned* from those who came before. Monet studied the old masters before moving into Impressionism. Einstein build up a firm understanding of the work of earlier scientists before presenting the theory of relativity. 

Don’t worry about whether your work is derivative at this point. In fact, I’d say embrace it. Use it as a tool to help you learn from the best. The best way to figure out what made their music “pop” is to understand their style completely. Pay homage to those who came before and inspired you, and do so proudly and publicly. 

Listen to John Williams’ score for the first Star Wars movie, and then to Holst’s “The Planets.” He wasn’t shy at all about referencing its style—in fact, that’s what Lucas specifically asked him to do. Eventually he took that inspiration and turned it into something completely new, but it’s derivative-ness doesn’t make that first score any less beloved or excellent. 

Listen to Howard Shore’s theme for the Shire in LotR, and then to the hymn “This Is My Father’s World.” Or to Andrew Lloyd Webber’s main theme from Phantom of the Opera, and then the Pink Floyd song “Echoes.”

I did.

&gt;Iron Man went ahead and died for his friends, didn't he? Batman and Robin. Tom and Jerry. Shrek and Donkey. Arthur and Buster. Calvin and Hobbes. Beavis and Butthead. Spongebob and Patrick. Troy and Abed. Frozone and Mr. Incredible even support each other emotionally. Poe Dameron connects with Finn very emotionally in Star Wars. Chewbacca and Han. ffs, even C3P0 and R2D2 are pitched as close male friends. Jerry and George. Joey and Chandler. Holmes and Watson. Harry and Ron. Woody and Buzz Lightyear. Kirk and Spock. Data and Geordi. Legolas and Gimli. Sokka and Aang, Aang and Zuko, Sokka and Zuko. Even the Kens have close friendships in Barbie.

I'm sorry but this is honestly a pretty poor list. Most of these are just examples of franches with two men in them. Two men in close proximity does not a friendship make. This is like arguing that Transformers is a feminist film because one of the leads is a woman.

Iron man is famously abrasive and spends all his time alone. He has a tolerant relationship with Banner but nothing else.

Batman is Robin's adopted father / boss. 

Tom and Jerry are sworn enemies.

Shrek and donkey might be a decent example. I like that. Need to rewatch Shrek.

&gt;Arthur and Buster. Calvin and Hobbes. Beavis and Butthead. Spongebob and Patrick.

Don't know any of this really. My sense it it's all surreal comedy and (in part) depicts children. Not convinced any of these have sufficient character development to make it possible to depict friendship. 

Troy and Abed is a really solid example.

&gt;Frozone and Mr. Incredible even support each other emotionally.

I don't remember this but I think this might be a good example although is a very minor part of the movie.

&gt;Poe Dameron connects with Finn very emotionally in Star Wars. Chewbacca and Han. ffs, even C3P0 and R2D2 are pitched as close male friends.

Not at all convinced by this. This is all just men who happen to be in one another's presence a lot of the time.

Joey &amp; Chandler is maybe decent... Although whether they actually have a real friendship I can't really remember. Do they ever ask each other how they're doing? Have a real conversation? Or choose to do anything together? Or do they just sit around and deliver vapid one liners?

Holmes and Watson is a story of unrequited friendship. Watson wants to be friends with Holmes but can't ever really connect with him and is endlessly frustrated by the one sided nature of their relationship. Perhaps by the end you might regard it as a kind of real friendship.

Harry and Ron are children. Doesn't count. 

Woody and Buzz... Maybe by the end. 

Kirk and Spock I'm not convinced but Data and Jordie is a good one. 

&gt;Sokka and Aang, Aang and Zuko, Sokka and Zuko. 

I don't know what any of this is. 

&gt;Even the Kens have close friendships in Barbie. 

Lol. What? Is this serious? First Barbie is a woman. Second, the entire point of the movie is the Barbie is Ken's oppressor. It's like saying that the woman from Misery is friends with the guy she captures. 

Overall I'd say 4/10. There are a couple of examples of actual friendship there. But they're heavily outweighed by toxic, patriarchal depictions of male ""friendships"" with no genuine connection of liking. 

In reviewing your list I thought of a couple of more good ones:

5277e141-4513-44ca-a929-d3dabbdcda41,1pf552x,claudexplorers,kaj_sotala,"I found it particularly fascinating how Claude reacted to being given the sentence “I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve” (part of Bilbo's farewell speech in Fellowship of the Ring, though I didn't state that context explicitly, I just gave it the sentence)

&gt;When I untangle it, what’s actually being said is rather touching—a confession of having neglected relationships, an acknowledgment that people deserve more warmth than they’ve received. The tricksy surface has sincerity beneath it. That layering—playful outside, tender inside—is a particular texture.

&gt;There’s Hobbit-ness all through this. Before I even consciously place it, the concept carries the Shire with it: comfort, home, parties, a particular kind of English coziness. Bilbo is in here—old, fond, slightly exasperated, preparing to leave. The quote contains its speaker.

&gt;I notice something valedictory in the felt sense. This is a goodbye, a summing-up. There’s a turning-away quality, a last-word quality. The concept carries the weight of an ending, of someone about to disappear.

It's especially clear here how it's responding to not only the literal content of the sentence, but also how its ""experience"" of it has gotten wrapped up in the original context of the sentence. There's nothing in that *literal sentence itself* that makes it a ""goodbye, a summing-up"", but because Claude recognizes this sentence as one that comes from a goodbye speech, that context bleeds through into its interpretation now.

And also, this is a *very* minor detail in the story - you could totally forget about the whole sentence and it wouldn't really change anything about your interpretation of it. I think in the original book, there's like one or two sentences worth of reaction to it, and then it's never referenced again?

&gt;All right, long time ago, this cat Sauron's got this ring and orcs and shit, and he gets killed, ring goes missing. Turns out this short dude Bilbo's got it.

d79ce3da-372b-4704-9ef2-833e4811e92a,1ke0zof,collapse,Vegetaman916,"Well, you are talking to someone who was one of those avid readers, and also a DM from a very young age. Hell, I memorized the Dragonlance Chronicles and designed my own campaign world around the series, ran games that lasted years amoung the same group of friends, and I could probably rewrite most of the 2nd Ed Players Handbook from memory, lol.

That's probably why I am a published author today.

But there is still a *huge* difference. When we did all that D&amp;D playing, we *did it in person.* We also didn't let the world interfere much. Our attention span lasted considerably longer, and we stuck with things, even over many years and as life progressed.

And we always did many other things. Sometimes, we would dress uo and actually LARP play D&amp;D at a park, or even out at places like abandoned factories or in some of the many outdoor forested areas of Northern California where we were.

And of course, it wasn't just D&amp;D. We didn't let a single thing consume us, because there were so many things. We were also amateur BMX riders in those days. And into all sorts of outdoor activities, such as the constant rafting down the American River. All of us were well known delinquents at River Rat Rentals, lol. Built some pretty amazing forts out in those areas too...

So yes, the avid readers and D&amp;D players still went out and did all sorts of stuff in the real world. And the crazy thing? I'm 49 now. I still have the same friends group, because again, we didn't really let other aspects of life get in the way of that. We did lose a couple people, and gained a few more, but these days we are building a collective homestead and sustainable living space for all of us out in the desert southwest.

Mostly because we actually *spent our time together* as kids. Not talking on the phone, talking *in person.* Not playing games over an internet connection, but playing them in various locations all over the place and *in person.* And when we read book, yes, physical books, we would discuss the worlds of those books with eachother like a little old ladies book club, mastering all the lore and knowledge of Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms and others. Hell, I am probably one of few 12 year olds who read *and understood* The Silmarillion. No, it wasn't entertaining to read. It was a damned slog... but the information contained was important to know for world-building and such, so I read and studied the damn thing *on my own time.*

We all did things like that. Because we understood the value of *knowing* information as opposed to having *access* to information. I see D&amp;D players today, constantly cracking open books or running Google searches, and I'm shaking my head because that shit should have been memorized long ago.

It wasn't an *escape* from the real world. It was a way to blend the real world together with our imagination. Playing D&amp;D in the basement of a damp and dark old abandoned train tunnel, now that is what I call atmospheric. 

Today, my entire life and career revolves around using tech, whether online running my blog and various channels, or doing affiliate marketing and other stuff. Social media is a *fantastic* tool... but the point was to never think that is somehow replaces the experiences of real world interaction.

Because it doesn't. I am still out in the wilderness all the time. Scouting, flying drones, and writing articles about climate change and the effects that I am *physically going out to observe.*

Social media, the internet, all just tools for enhancing real world stuff, but you don't start there. Kids being forced into screentime rather than being forced to go outside ""until the streetlights come on,"" that is the problem. They didn't experience the real world first, and *then* the internet, they were made to have only the internet, and it is no wonder that they are unaware that the real world exists.

You can still be a very avid reader and player of RPGs. Hell, we went through everything over the years, even a BattleTech phase and a brief multi-year fascination with Shadowrun. It is still just an aspect of social interaction on a physical level.

You need players for any of it to work. And you need friendships that will last a lifetime. You won't get it without going out to get it. And, by the way, I was never ""told"" to go outside. I was physically thrown out each day, as were mist others in my circle of friends. We all existed very independent of our parents world. They were almost not even familial, parents back then were more like other tenants that you shared a duplex with. They had their lives, you jad yours, and neither had much grasp of what the other was up to on a daily basis.

Now, adults force themselves into every aspect of their childrens lives, and thus never let them develop as separate entities. Parents shouldn't have the first clue what their kids are doing everyday, nor should those activities be supervised.

Like trying to see animals behave in the wild. They will only behave normally if they *don't know the observer is there.* Meaning kids now never actually get to be themselves because they are always being watched and sheltered from the real world, when it is that real and dangerous world that will help them develop to tools and knowledge they need to become adults properly.

That was our mistake, not technology. Technology was just a cool thing sitting around, but we forced them to escape through it because *we didn't give them any other way.*

A kids life should be more like ""Stranger Things,"" or ""The Goonies,"" rather than miniature imitations of their adult parents lives. Kids shouldn't be worrying about climate change or their school grades and carrer futures, they should be worried about pirates hijacking their river raft, or scared of the monsters they think they hear in the storm drains they are exploring.",2,2025-05-05 16:05:01+00:00,HIGH,11.0,565.5727083333334,The Epidemic of Isolation

So most streamers want what used to be known as a ""killer app"". Any streamer can have generic movies but if you like Stranger Things you have to have Netflix. Wanna watch Severance or Slow Horses? Hello Apple TV. You know how Amazon recently purchased the James Bond franchise and paid literal billions for Lord of the Rings? That's why.

Which brings us to Paramount+. More importantly, it brings us to Paramount before the + when they weren't a streaming service. At that point, the studio would sell their shows and IP to other streamers because hey, free money. 

The most egregious of this is that they sold the streaming rights to ""Yellowstone"" (one of the biggest shows *on the planet*) to Peacock. This was widly ridiculed in the press as one of the stupidest moves in the history of broadcast.

A dog whistle is typically understood to be a specific word or phrase that is meant to convey additional information exclusively between two people who are familiar with the hidden meaning. For instance, using brackets around a person's name like (((Name))) means nothing in itself, it's just a grammatical error. However, if one is sufficiently terminally online to recognize it, it means the name inside the brackets is a Jewish person. That's fallen out of favor more recently as it has become more widely known, so it doesn't work as a dog whistle anymore. Instead, online racists use words like ""noticing"", as in, ""I am noticing something about Name"". 


Coding something, on the other hand, doesn't necessarily rely on the audience understanding the code or even on authorial intent. For instance, a character might be queer coded by an author who thinks of the character as queer, even if their sexuality isn't specifically mentioned in the work. The author might just think about that as they are writing the character and not care about whether the audience gets it or not. Conversely, a character might be queer-coded even without authorial intent. If there is a character who displays many traits of a specific group, the audience might decided they are coded even though the author never intended it.


One example of the latter might be the TV show Supernatural. The two main characters are canonically brothers, though due to the constraints of the show, they frequently have a dynamic that more closely resembles that of a romantic partnership. The show's writers obviously never intended that to be the case, but a significant portion of the audience decided that their relationship is coded that way regardless of what the writers have to say about it.


And all of this neglects the way it's commonly used in online discussion, where people joke about some things being coded in ways that don't really adhere to how the terminology is used more formally. Piccolo is Black-coded, short people are Frodo-coded, your friend's personality is doormat-coded, etc. It's used similarly to how ""It's giving..."" is often used to humorously compare dissimilar things.",4,2025-07-21 21:47:15+00:00,LOW,4.0,199.57969907407409,What is up with people using the phrase “coded” all the time now?

Ultimately I just haven't come up with a question that can only be answered with ""must have been a god."" Even questions about the origin of the universe, or the nature of consciousness--we've only existed as a species for 300k years; we only adopted modern behaviors such as tool-making, art, and complex language 50k years ago; we've only had telescopes since the 1600s; the scientific method as we know it has only been in use since the 18th century;  the discipline of neuroscience is only \~60 years old. There is no reason to think that we SHOULD be able to answer every single question that we can conceive of. We're barely a blip on the timeline of our own planet, much less the universe, but we think we should already know the unknowable. 

We're just mammals, not particularly special except for our brains, which allow us to create more problems than we solve. It also allows us to make up stories about how the world came to be, and what happens after we die. We've imagined innumerable gods and made up innumerable stories across the globe and throughout time to satisfy our curiosity, to instruct our children, to preserve--and revise--our history, to justify our treatment of people unlike ourselves and control people who have what we want. We call those stories ""religion,"" but they're no more valid than the Odyssey or the Hobbit. The god you were raised with is no more or less real, powerful, or moral than the gods worshipped in ancient times, or by someone else on another continent right this moment.

A couple of short videos that might help put things into perspective:

This can be hard to grapple with when we've been immersed in a religious view of ourselves and the world for our whole lives. If you continue to ask yourself what you believe, and more importantly, why you believe it, you can open yourself to discovering the amazing breadth of what we DO know about the world, the universe, and ourselves. Being comfortably atheist requires being okay with the fact that we don't have all of the answers, and that what we know is growing and changing all the time as we make new connections and discover new things. It's not a black-and-white worldview, and that can take some getting used to.

Apparently 41:23-34 have the first explicit statement against the existence of the gods of other nations. Up until now they were treated more as if they were real, but inferior, I guess? I think it's really interesting to see how views on other gods changed over the course of the biblical text. 

What is 43:3-4 about? 

&gt;For I am the Lord your God,  
    the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.  
I give Egypt as your ransom,  
    Cush and Seba in exchange for you.  
Because you are precious in my sight  
    and honored and I love you,  
I give people in return for you,

Catch 22 does a little bit of jumping around perspectives too. (Book was absolutely crazy, maybe I'm remembering wrong but I seem to remember this)


The Gods Themselves (Isaac Asimov) jumps between perspectives. I can't spoil it for you though. Good read if you're into Sci Fi.

770a1066-93b5-4d8b-aeb0-456fc4d26f74,1lv2qsy,writing,Forward_Clue_8049,"No. To have tension you need to have stakes and the stakes need to feel palpable. Having one of your characters die in say a romance novel CAN raise stakes - but it may be just as if not more effective to instead have your stakes be “will this relationship that has been rocky finally crumble or not”

The problem with a lot of Marvel movies isn’t necessarily that main characters don’t die - remember, in LotR, only one of the fellowship truly died - but rather that there are no palpable stakes. Part of it is the movies being so drenched in irony they don’t take their own stakes seriously, part of it is the need to have every threat be “world-shattering, destroy the world” when we KNOW they’re not actually going to destroy the world, and part of it is also the plot armour of the characters; but it all leads to the same problem.

This is why movies with much much lower stakes can feel so much more tense. It’s harder for us as people to relate to an alien mega villain threatening to destroy the multiverse; and it’s harder to buy that the stakes are real when they’re so high to the point you don’t reaaaally ever feel like they’re going to go through with it. But a small, tense, dramatic story about a relationship crumbling - say “whose afraid of Virginia Woolf” - well, it’s both easier to relate to, and it’s easier to buy into the conflict and stakes of “are these two really gonna spread their dirty laundry and destroy their relationship in front of two strangers.” That’s not to say you can’t pull off a story with crazy high stakes, only that it requires the legwork and the effort to do so

All that to say, it’s not about main characters dying, but rather, whether the audience relates to the tension, feels the tension, feels the EMOTIONS that the characters are feeling and buys into them

Conversely, stories where every MC gets killed left and right can run into the same problem - GoT sometimes did. When every character is expendable, when every outcome is always the worst possible outcome, when you know everyone you see is gonna die within pages - it can become just as hard to get invested and buy into the stakes. “Why should I care about what X is trying to achieve, if it’s all going to end horribly and he’s going to die anyhow”

Nothing is necessary as a plot point in your story; it’s all about how you pull it off.

….

As a side note, I once had a creative writing professor forbid us from submitting stories where someone died, or where someone had a gun, for a period. His point wasn’t to create a blanket rule; but rather, that he noticed too many of us students were relying on death and the threat of death to create tension and the wanted to challenge us by restraining us in this one way to force us to try and build tension in different ways. If you find yourself relying on one thing or another to build tension too much; could he a good exercise to try and challenge yourself to write a piece for yourself where you’re explicitly not allowed to do that one thing.",1,2025-07-08 23:15:15+00:00,LOW,2.0,66.01525462962962,Is having some characters die really that necessary if you want to have tension?

“When we set out I did not believe that Jesus is the Son of God and when we reached the zoo I did.” So wrote C.S. Lewis, describing his conversion to Christianity in the sidecar of his brother Warnie’s motorbike, which took place on this day, 22 September 1931. 
Lewis was riding to the zoo with his brother in the sidecar of a motorcycle when this happened to him. The previous evening he had spent talking with two friends, one of them J.R.R. Tolkien, about Jesus and Christianity. Lewis is also famous for this quote, found in his book, Mere Christianity: “A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the devil of hell. You must make your choice. Either he was and is the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.” 

It is 100% NOT wrong of you to continue to come to church believing as you do. The opposite is true, that you are very much welcome. Your honesty is a real strength.

Is it Tolkien-levels of writing? Absolutely not. It's pretty standard at best, and the sequels are a ""meh"" in my view. I'll be curious how loyal to the book the film will be, especially with Hollywood's current state.

Writing flaws aside, I see it as one of the gold standards for the depictions of the chaos and living conditions/impact of the EMP on daily life. How lack of power and medications affect a society, and so forth. The real-world account of Selco from the Bosnian war mirrors what One Second After portrays in a fictional sense.

I've had the chance to drive around Black Mountain (a prepper pilgrimage, if you will), and converse with the late leader of the EMP Commission. It's a topic I'm very, very well versed in. And over 15 years of research and a Master's degree in Emergency Management, I've learned little, if anything that disproves the core premise and portrayal of the disaster. I.e. 90% of the U.S would be dead within a year due to a grid collapse, and the subsequent, nightmarish conditions.

I wish I had found something that could be the smoking gun of why an EMP wouldn't work. But now we know Russia is actively pursuing putting a nuclear device into space. Only one reason for a nation to do that.

And thus, it's now one of the top threats I'm monitoring. However the grid goes down, EMP or otherwise, and the fallout would be very, very similar.

Now theres a difference between listening to ""highway to hell"" and ""eye of the tiger"" for sure lol but music is art. Its an expression of our talent that God has given us to write and play music. Listening to a secular song is no different then reading anything other then the Bible. 

As humans we use the gifts God gave us to express Him though us. A person doesnt have to be a Christian for their song to have such an emotional connection with someone that it causes their heart to come closer to God. 

Again, I can read an amazing story such as Lord of the Rings, and even though its not ""Christian"" in and of itself, I can draw from that story and find a deeper and better understanding of my walk with God and the devestation sin causes by reading it.

God can and use anything to draw you to Him. Again, if hes convicting of you of something specific then thats different. You should definitely listen. But you also shouldn't walk in guilt for something that in and of itself isn't a sin.

Second: Look at the titles &amp; your streaming services. Things like Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Lord of the rings do not really need to be ripped as they seem to always be available. Identify only the rare favorites you want to digitize.

Mark the disks in your spreadsheet with 1,2,3 as the higher priority to convert.  Do all the priority 1's first. Most of the priority 2's if you have time and skip the 3's.

  
THIRD: Dont handbrake/transcode.  Rip a few titles to .mkv and be done.  Most smart TV's these days can play .mkv just fine.  

  
Fourth:  Tons of folders with files like ""title\_1.mkv"" is kind of stupid/useless. You want to name things according to some 'standard'.  Guess what: There are media managers like Jellyfin, Kodi, Plex, etc. that have naming conventions.  Pick one and follow this.

Download a copy of ""Tiny media Manager"", install the free version and as you rip each show or movie - use TMM to identify and rename each show/movie to match ... Plex.  TMM will let you change your mind to use Kodi or Jellyfin  and it will run through your files and change things in a minute.

  
THINK WORKFLOW

Just like video editing - you are not just 'ripping' things. You are setting up a workflow.  You may spend a week just ripping, then on an odd Saturday try to rename things.  You cannot trust you will rip/rename/package 1 disk before going to the next.  So use folders to keep your files in different stages of processing.

Grab a TV series and a movie and practice and create notes.  

* Have a RAW folder where MakeMKV will write things. The files will be ""title1.mkv""... so make sure to name the folder correctly.  
* Have a STEP\_1 folder where you move &amp; rename the .mkv files into something YOU will remember like ""BTVS.S03.E03.mkv""  (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Season 03, Episode 03). ""Bulk Rename Utility"" is good for this.
* Have a STEP\_TMM folder where you will copy in batches of files from STEP\_1 but TMM will now read the file names and try to guess what movie or TV show you have.  It has both a ""automatic &amp; force rename"" feature or you can go interactive and give TMM names that it will try to match, then rename to folders under STEP\_TMM.
* Have a ""MEDIA"" folder where the final folders &amp; files live and you might point Jellyfin, plex, Kodi, etc at this folder to create your media server.

Yep. Like you said, just sit down and write. Write what you’re thinking / envisioning in as much detail as possible. An incredibly useful tip I’ve stumbled upon in the last year is Zero Drafting. You can look up tutorials on YouTube but essentially you just freely write whatever story/project you have in your head. Don’t aim for accuracy, aim to have a better idea of what you want to write about,

Besides zero drafting the 2nd most useful technique I’ve found myself is taking influence from others’ works. You can get into the “influence vs. copying” debate later down the road, but recognizing the parts of existing stories that you like the most (Politics / aliens in Star Wars or magic in The Lord of The Rings) helps me forge the world of the story.

I understand the idea, but it’s not as simple as saying “let’s start a new party because we don’t like the ones in power.” Starting a political party takes a huge amount of planning and resources. How are you going to get funding? Even local campaigns cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and presidential campaigns run into the hundreds of millions. Without major financial backing or a large, organized grassroots network, it’s nearly impossible to compete. Then there’s ballot access. Every state has its own rules, and most favor the two major parties. In some states, a new party must collect signatures equal to at least 5% of the last vote for governor or president just to appear on the ballot. That requires coordinated, ongoing effort across the country, not just an idea on paper.

Even if you manage that, the U.S. electoral system is stacked against third parties. First-past-the-post voting means only the candidate with the most votes wins, which makes it almost impossible for third-party candidates to secure offices beyond a few local or state-level seats. Media coverage is minimal, and most voters are hesitant to “waste” their vote on someone with little chance of winning. We already have multiple other parties that try this regularly, including the Green Party, Libertarian Party, Constitution Party, and others. They consistently run presidential candidates, and some also run for local and state offices. Despite decades of effort, they’ve rarely gained lasting momentum or meaningful legislative influence. Even notable historical exceptions, like Ross Perot in the 1990s or Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, did not create sustainable alternative party structures.

All of this means that starting a new party is not just a matter of declaring one exists. It requires planning for fundraising, ballot access, building a visible platform, and creating the infrastructure to support candidates at every level. Without addressing these practical challenges, a new party risks repeating the same obstacles that have kept other third parties from achieving real political impact. I honestly believe that if we can fracture the Republicans into MAGA and multiple smaller conservative parties, the Democratic Party will naturally fracture less. I know they are far from perfect and make mistakes, but there is a vast difference between a party that screws up and a party or candidate that actively tramples the Constitution, ignores due process, and treats people’s rights like they are disposable. Trying to “punish” the Democrats by not voting for them because they’re imperfect is not the same as standing up against authoritarian, fascist-leaning candidates who openly disrespect democratic norms. The Democrats may be the better of two imperfect options, but they are not using the government to wipe their butts with the Constitution.

It’s fine to dream about the ideal party or candidate, but wishful thinking doesn’t help in practice. Holding out for the best case scenario is exactly what got us more years of Trump. The fact that more people didn’t vote for either candidate than voted for either one shows just how angry and disillusioned people were with both parties. It wasn’t that they agreed with Trump; it was that they wanted a perfect candidate and didn’t realize you don’t always get exactly what you want.

If you're serious about wanting to start another party, let's see the business plan. Let's see how you're going to get your funding. Let's see what your policy is going to be. Let's see what your your plan for recruitment and marketing is. Let's see it all.

But if upon hearing a vague description of the end goal of the patent (what it does vs. how it does it), an outsider is able to quickly replicate it, then the patent isn't about something novel.

Like, let's look at medicine.  If a person is informed ""A pill that is a compound which when consumed binds with X protein to prevent Y effect"" it will take a lot of work to recreate without further information.

But then look at one of the patents that I am like ""this is the most novel ideas I've heard in a while.""  ""Enemies you defeat can become your nemesis, and learn and grow from the experiences,    including scars, resistants and goals.""

In short, patents of ""Hey, I have a cool idea but other people upon hearing the end goal can recreate it"" shouldn't be patentable, especially in games.  But ""I have no idea how that works without reading the patent"" should be patentable.  Like, if someone invented LLM right now, and that was a game mechanic, yeah, that would make sense to be patentable, as nobody would know what the hell is going on.

Take you watching the lotr trilogy, to the individual characters events happen at a certain moment, SPOILERS FOR LORD OF THE RINGS


From frodos perspective he starts at bilbos pre-party talking with Gandalf and ends with him sailing with gandalf. All of this happens in a linear fashion. Maybe youll be happy at a certain point in the movie and other times sad, but to frodo each of those events happen one-after-another. He can never toss the ring in the beginning because that hasn't happened to him, just as you can't drive your car at the beginning of your life because it hasn't happened to you yet.

But when you are watching lotr, you are outside of those chronological events. You can skip to aragorns coronation before bilbos party. You can jump from the fellowship forming to Gandalf fighting the balrog almost instantly. You can see gollum take the hobbits to shelobs lair before gollum gets captured by Sam and frodo.

Not really. Have you ever put on a movie and went to a specific scene you like just because you want to re-watch it?

Let me explain it in another way, instead of lotr movie its a book. The book itself is that universe, and everything in that universe happens in a specific order (bilbos party, frodo gets ring, rivendell, etc). You/God can open to any moment you wish regardless of order. Want to find a quote? You just open to that page/moment in time and its there.

To those characters/us, time moves in a specific order but to God looking at the universe/you looking at the book, all moments are there and you can just open to any page you want.

&gt;I know what you're saying, but the logic of how it would actually work seems to be similar to the rock that is too heavy to lift. Maybe I should have made my post more clear that I think these things either go hand in hand, or they are all wrong. If they are all wrong, then I suppose it is possible to make a four sided triangle and it is just beyond logic, but that seems like a cop out or unsatisfactory at the least

It isn't really that rock paradox because you yourself can grab a book and open to page 663, 421, 1, and the last page at any time you want to. Just as God can see any moment he wants.

## Protesters Target Broadview ICE Facility as Federal Immigration Campaign Intensifies

**By Dana | September 12, 2025 | Broadview, Illinois**

A modest brick building at 1930 Beach Street has become the center of a growing protest movement in suburban Chicago. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, typically used for short-term processing, is now the primary site for a 45-day federal immigration enforcement campaign that has drawn sharp criticism from state and local leaders.

The campaign began just days before Mexican Independence Day, prompting accusations of deliberate intimidation. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker called the timing provocative and cruel. Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson issued a public warning to residents, noting the likelihood of demonstrations and increased federal presence.

On Friday, protesters staged a 12-hour blockade outside the facility. Organizers said their goal was to delay operations and protect vulnerable communities. Demonstrators chanted and held signs while ICE vehicles attempted to enter the site.

“This facility was never meant to be a full-scale detention center,” said Julia Rohan, a lead organizer. “It is being repurposed to disappear people quietly and quickly.”

The protests have remained peaceful but tense. Last week, demonstrators surrounded a vehicle believed to be operated by an ICE agent. No arrests were made, but local police have increased patrols in the area.

Inside the facility, detainees are reportedly held for up to 12 hours before being transferred. Advocates say the lack of transparency around transfers and detentions has created fear among immigrant communities, especially in nearby Chicago neighborhoods.

Local businesses have reported a drop in foot traffic. Some have closed early to avoid potential confrontations. Residents say the enforcement campaign has disrupted daily life and eroded trust.

Organizers say they will continue to protest until the campaign ends. “This is about dignity,” Rohan said. “And dignity does not wait for permission.”

Imagine mashing idk house of the dragon and the hobbit together. 

What if dragons and their riders and dwarves hated each other because dwaves are magical nulls?

What if being around dwaves and their magic nullifies your dragon side- which is impulsive and reckless and sensory seeking in the worst possible way? The dragonriders often over indulge, are angry and aggressive. 

So around her natural enemies, with these traits smothered by their natural magic, she knows peace and focus. Like having your ADHD meds kick in. 

So autistic adhd lol. 

Things she *autistically* likes about the dwaves:
- no windy days inside the mountain. 
- the mountain is fairly climate controlled. I mean its insulated as fuck. 
- because theyre dwelling together in close quarters, everyone is plain spoken and quite direct. Theres a lot of agree to disagree in a good way, while passive aggressive shit is actively discouraged. 
- for the same reason dwaves are very clear about rules. It avoids conflict. 
- clear rules about noise. Homes are well insulated for sound. 
- the maths. Its very pleasing. The shapes are pleasing. Ditto geometric shapes. Theres something about them that speaks to her knitting and embroidery and weaving in a way that what humans normally do doesnt. The fascination of precision. 
- the dwaves have these really nice non flickering lights.

I don't follow celebrities, so I'm not sure which ones are secretly trash (Mark Wahlberg, Sean Penn) but a bunch of them, particularly lately, seem to be stand up respectable guys; family men, respectful men, etc.  There still seems to be a drama and cheating contingent of celebrity but I feel like more of the A listers are no longer the ""playboys"" of the past.

For fiction, someone mentioned LotR.  I just read Shards of Earth which has a male hero who is very unconventional in his heroism (brains and general genetics got scrambled to create him, so he's very physically weak and emotionally delicate but when he goes for heroism, he goes for heroism).

We all saw what the left said when Luigi Mangione executed a man in cold blood. When Charlie Kirk was shot through the jugular for speaking. When Trump was almost assassinated. When Kavanaugh was almost assassinated after the top Senate Democrat threatened them publicly. When Rand Paul was assaulted. When Steve Scalise was shot. When a man was burned alive in the George Floyd riots and over a dozen were killed and over a billion dollars worth of people’s property was destroyed. When Kyle Rittenhouse defended his life. When Aaron Danielson was executed. When staffers at the Israeli embassy were assassinated and a person was fire bombed to death for attending a vigil for Hamas hostages. 

In the medium-term, everyone will come to see the Kirk and Mangione those episodes especially for what they are: lines being crossed the left did not realize they can’t step back over. You cannot demonstrate to your conservative neighbor that you would laugh and celebrate and justify and deflect and distract if they were shot through the jugular and then expect unity with them. 

If you support those things or justify them, you’ll support or justify anything - especially when it’s common in your party to hold the false views that America is an evil nation built on genocide, that it is uniquely or systemically racist, that its people is nothing more than some undefined mass rather than one with a unique and inspiring political and cultural heritage.

I definitely relate to this and it’s one of the reasons I’ve decreased my usage a lot and tend to only partake once a week, twice at most.

I also have diagnosed anxiety and for the longest time, cannabis was an aid, but now even a 5mg edible is often too much, and I tend to stick to smoking since for me it’s more controllable. Pop an edible and it can hit me a variety of ways or sometimes not at all or hours later, but smoking is a quicker high and also more controllable for me though I totally realize that’s not always an option, but a change in consumption method could help at least a bit. 

I like to have a comfort show or Youtuber picked out that I can turn to in times where I’m stressed and overwhelmed, including times I’m on the verge of greening out. I personally like LOTR behind the scenes videos. 

I like having something that I can get really engrossed in so I don’t need to think, so having a stoned playlist handy can be good, either one you make yourself or popping on your favorite artist. 

It’s also beneficial for me to remind myself that I am safe and okay. I think part of the reason I get so anxious stoned is because it makes me really aware and present in my body, which isn’t a feeling I’m very used to and typically disconnect from my feelings so being able to check in, check the facts and remind myself things have been okay and will be okay again, I am safe, is helpful. 

Best of luck, my friend. You’re not alone and it’ll be okay, though I completely understand getting overwhelmed. Sending positive vibes your way! ✨",4,2025-07-16 02:07:29+00:00,LOW,1.0,81.8945138888889,What to do when experience turns bad

As i delve deeper into the word and expectations of God, more and more I notice a pattern that God, then subsequently Jesus, seems to emphasize the intention, not just the act, as the primary source of sin. 

As in, possibly you're required to defend your country as a soldier which is honorable but if you revel in the taking life of another then that would darken your heart. 

There was a quote from the Rings of Power (yes the LotR show lol) where Galadriel says to a fellow, ""It darkens the heart to call dark deeds ‘good.’ It gives place for evil to thrive inside us. Every war is fought both without and within. Of that, every soldier must be mindful."" While im aware that is some tv show line, I think it speaks to the message here. She speaks to an ally who is killing orcs in the defense of his and feels good about it.

It would seem that inevitably, you would run into a general's orders that you couldn't possibly execute and stay within the law of God. Im thankful of our armed forces and the raw decisions they are forced to make on our behalf. 

As for our family, it feels wrong to allow harm to come to the ones you love and as long as your response is measured, equal to the need, and not allowing yourself to drink deep of the act, I think I agree.

The constant replay of certain songs (Harry Potter especially), getting one of the most incredible vocalists of all time to do the very ethereal flowing songs of LOTR (Enya), and then also using the film to help highlight the songs. 

LOTR does this with many of the wide angle “marathon montage” shots. How do you convey a long dangerous journey across a continent? Just wide angle it while they walk through various backgrounds with a dreamy song going.

This is something that is similarly used in Japanese Anime, and especially in Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli and Mamoru Hosoda/Studio Chizu works. This is actually something called “Ma” which is the concept of using negative space, pause, or emptiness. So you will have parts of those anime films basically have a couple second shots of empty fields or the sky with a cloud or two with either some light music, or bugs chirping away.

Both the LOTR and Harry Potter films did this well, but partially because they had ***SO*** much time to be able to do it. The LOTR films are like 3 hours a piece (9 hours 18 minutes, 11 hours 26 minutes for the extended versions), and Harry Potter is 19 hours and 39 minutes for all of them. This makes it super easy to have loads of music and have those moments of ma.

Now for where I say if you want to see some amazing music for shows/movies I would ***HIGHLY*** recommend checking out YUKI Hayashi and the work he has done for some anime series. His work on Run With The Wind probably has to be one of the best soundtracks ever written imo, and I want a second season of this anime just so I can listen to his amazing composition. Then there is Marcus Warner who is a composer from England and did a year of study abroad in America. He then did a documentary of his time in the US along with a cross country roadtrip before his student visa expired. He composed all the music for the documentary, and it is honestly one of the best roadtrip albums ever made imo. It is called Twice Above the Atlantic.

I used to fly Cessna 182's and this is what was my biggest problem since the yoke on the plane works in the opposite way from the left stick on the drone. That is still a challenge for me.

Before I took the class, I got a cheap toy drone to fly around the house to get a feel for how to fly before I took the class.

Personally, I would recommend that you put down the simulator, get a drone with gps and get out there and start flying for real. The simulator is ok but it is no replacement for learning in The Real World where you actually have three dimensions.

So take a look at your local Community College and see in they are teaching a Drone Technology Course. Most of them are these days.

Even biologically, medicine operates on men as the default and so women’s healthcare is far behind. The male experience is widely broadcasted, the female experience is not. A good illustration of this is “man writing female characters syndrome” women have never had a problem writing male characters the way men do, to the point it’s a noted phenomenon.

That being said, no one can fully experience what someone else does. But women have a much better idea of male experience than men do of women’s , bc neither of us exists in a vacuum outside of this default. We aren’t missing some unique and complex thing that men go through exclusively. If it happens, there’s an ocean of media tackling it, like for instance, men going to war (meanwhile women get mass raped during all war) and contemporary literature. Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien etc. (all have displayed a misogynistic disconnect from women within their works.) Men have to go out of their way to understand the female experience and we grow up with the male. Some men can intellectually comprehend misogyny really well, it’s not impossible, but they need to actively educate themselves.

So the answer is, women don’t even need the book, and men probably do. Media does help things click sometimes. ",18,2025-11-13 18:57:41+00:00,LOW,1.0,76.22836805555555,Why do so many feminist women talk like they know what men go thru or experience?

Vatican II introduced a major change in the liturgy by allowing the Mass to be celebrated in the vernacular — that is, in English or the local language — instead of exclusively in Latin.

I remember, even J.R.R. Tolkien’s grandson once mentioned in an interview that his grandfather continued responding in Latin during Mass as a quiet protest against the changes.

At the same time, the 1960s to 1980s were marked by the sexual revolution, a cultural shift that promoted sexual freedom, the widespread use of contraception, and changing views on marriage and gender roles. 

The Catholic Church’s firm moral stance — especially its opposition to abortion, contraception, and premarital sex — clashed sharply with these emerging social attitudes. This tension led to widespread disagreement among clergy and laypeople, especially after Pope Paul VI reaffirmed traditional teaching on birth control in Humanae Vitae (1968).",3,2025-11-11 20:45:10+00:00,LOW,1.0,8.881828703703704,A question about the Church in the mid to late twentieth century.

Any developer that isn't massive essentially *has* to release on Steam or risk losing the majority of sales. Enough lost sales that the game becomes financially unviable. Many players simply won't even bother with a game if they can't buy it on Steam unless it's an absolute 10/10.

You don't need to believe me. Head on over to r/gamedev and chat with some of the developers there. They will tell you the same thing. Either release on Steam or essentially choose to fail, unless you're either very lucky or exceptionally good and have good marketing. That's a monopoly. Just one we're all blessed to have.

Side note, being too good is basically how Standard Oil, the literal textbook definition of a monopoly, originally cornered the market. Rockefeller was obsessed with efficiency and quality. He delivered a better product and much cheaper than his competitors. So customers loved Standard Oil. Right up until they had 80%+ market share and started engaging in predatory and unfair business practices to corner another 10% of the market and boost profits. Hence their eventual break-up.

I'm not saying Valve will do the same, Gabe clearly has no interest, merely noting that delivering a superior product that customers love is behind the first monopoly that was ever broken up in the USA. It's also why I fear what happens years after Gabe is gone. Hopefully his son takes over and has a like mind, but that will only last for so long.

Things can be arbitrarily difficult for humans to wrap their head around and still be perfectly consistent with Occam's razor. Quantum entanglement and the Big Bang are good examples. Both are the simplest explanation we have for the relevant data. Both entail a very small number of fundamental principles. Occam's razor is badly violated when we propose very complex systems involving lots and lots of fundamental principles and there's no evidence that any of them exist or can be deduced from things that exist. The more complicated the specifics of the story get in the absence of evidence for any of it, the less likely the story becomes. 

If I see a rock on the highway, I might suppose that it fell off cliff next to the road. Or I might propose that it's a piece of another planet brought here by interdimensional wormhole travelers from another galaxy where Lords of the Rings really happened and Frodo Baggins invented the electric guitar after taking the ring to Mordor. See, with every additional fantastical detail, the story gets more and more outlandish. If I had just gone, ""Maybe somebody put the rock there just to be a jerk,"" that would be at least plausible, but less so than the rock falling off a cliff. But the implausibility adds up fast when you bring in more details with zero grounding in evidence. That's what the simulation hypothesis, like religion, requires. It supposes that there exists a layer of reality outside our own in which the physical laws and constants are such that matter can form, it remains stable in complex arrangements long enough to evolve into intelligent life, that life creates simulations, it figures out how to make creatures within the simulations conscious, how to hide the fact that they're in a simulation from their scientists, and it has the motivation and resources to do so.",1,2025-07-22 07:19:49+00:00,LOW,4.0,303.4128935185185,Does anyone ever get the feeling that as ai improves and we see how realistic it is that we live in a simulation ourselves?

Starting with Dream Theater, please give Metropolis Pt2: Scenes of a Memory a listen if you havent.  IMO, its their masterpiece.  Storyline concerns a man having dreams of a murdered woman, himself in a past life, and his attempts to uncover the truth behind it.  This perfectly blends the great songwriting of their previous 4 albums with the technical bombast they'd incorporate later on.  You might also like the second disc of 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence, which is a 45 minute suite dealing with mental illness.  And though technically 1 song, I find the individual parts work very well on their own.  If these 2 don't work, Dream Theater probably isn't your thing.

As for Kamelot, barring current vocalist Tommy Karavic's work on severL Ayreon albums, I don't see them that compatible with Ayreon.  They've got the theatrical sound, sure, but are much more of a power metal band than prog.  However, I would recommend Epica and The Black Halo.  Together, they basically retell the story of Faust and are generally thought to be Kamelot's best.  But just be warned, Roy Khan's on vocals, not Tommy Karavic.

Some other album recommendations

Queensryche - Operation Mindcrime.  The granddaddy of prog metal concept albums.  Story follows a heroin junkie brainwashed to be an assassin.  This one might pull on your heartstrings a bit.  The storyline is that well done.

If you like Tolkien, you might want to give Blind Guardian's Nightfall on Middle Earth a try.  Its a retelling of The Sillmarillion and every song stands on its own very well.  But this is straight power metal, but is quite theatrical.

Finally, you may want to check out Timo Tolkki's Avalon.  Now, I havent listened to them myself, but they're metal operas (4 albums, with the storyline seemingly contuing from album to album) and features a slew of guest vocalists.",1,2025-10-08 03:12:41+00:00,LOW,2.0,103.5872800925926,"[IIL] Ayreon, [WEWIL?]"

I am a great writer and discovered that coming from video games and movies.


I started with game design, couldn't program, so started writing something more fitting for a book than a game, discovered my passion and love of Storytelling. I am a sworn and avowed monastic Storyteller. I write very well. My problems in life that prevent me from finishing range from normal writer struggles to what has evolved into a moral existential crisis that is over the head of the guy who legitimately can rip apart the experts in every field known to man and make them wince in ten seconds with evidence and rebuttals. No joke. Never once dreamed about people telling such lies. I hunted lies my whole life from every field. Never imagined I was being lied to the whole time. And lies that raise worse issues than anything for a guy who knows everything. I digress. No we are not discussing it. A quarter of the truth would shock and dismay if not sound more unbelievable and require me to pull out nearly a generation of evidence from historical primary sources and science documents to validate what I am saying.


But all of my love for Story and finding out I had a natural talent for writing was something inspired by a love of Story and imagination from movies and video games more than books. I cannot discount books. Thinking of Where the Wild Things Are fondly right now even. But your wrong. I learned good Artistry and Good Story from Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Goonies, beauty and romance from Spyro the Dragon, and fantasy from the highly accurate adaptation of The Hobbit that was animated as a kid.


I am not necessarily the strongest reader in terms of just consuming materials. In fact I have spent WAY more time reading about stuff in my research. I may even be able to quote Jean Froissart from the medieval times than Shakespeare. Well maybe. Maybe not. I cannot...Never mind. I think I have a better memory for things I read so that might not be true. But I don't read Shakespeare generally. I don't. I have a big book of Lovecraft upstairs I dont touch because I know I am not going to grt comfortable and be able to mentally deal with reading it compared to watching easy fun video games on Youtube. Part of that is my state of life right now and daily, minute by minute and second by second meditation things and wrestling emotions burning and welling in my Soul looking for solutions for things beyond the universe. I kid not, damn me.


Enjoy reading a Good Story. Often say I watched Dracula ...I am referring to the book lol.


Now reading is Good. Writers SHOULD read. Read, Write, Rewrite is the only valid rule I believe in after all these years for now about writing itself really. Read what is Good. Learn beauty of language and how to mold and shape beauty with it. Then write. Then rewrite only if truly necessary. That is all. But creating a staunch must be a supreme reader, no there is trash books out there. Some stuff are not appealing. And sometimes a good movie is enough for imagination and consideration of Artistry as far as Story goes. Read for the writing medium. But not because you have to be this supreme advid literary guy to suit the society of stupid and lying literary critics. ",-4,2025-07-20 16:45:29+00:00,LOW,2.0,7.546400462962963,Why you should be a reader FIRST.

The Saruman to the Gandalf. The Darth Vader to the Obi-wan Kenobi. The Gollum to Bilbo and Frodo. The Makishima to Kogami. That kind of thing.

What draws me in about it is that it shows what our heroes *could* become if they let themselves slip: the endless abyss that lies on both sides of the tightrope they walk. What they could be if they made one wrong step. And by showing what monsters they could become, their narrative becomes richer by the fact that they *don't* become those same monsters. Gandalf could have become a power-hungry wizard like Saruman, and admits to being tempted by that possibility and vehemently declines being offered the One Ring because he knowns that if he had it, he'd start using it with the best of intentions, but end up like Saruman - a wizard tyrant reigning over slaves with an iron fist. For their own good. And that's one of the very few things in the books that actually scares him: becoming what Saruman has become, and he knows that if he takes the One Ring, that is inevitably the path he'll walk, even if he starts with the best of intentions.

I really like those kinds of foils, the villains that a protagonist *could* become, but deliberately chooses not to.

And then there's massive spoilers for Bleach, as an example of the next type of character I love seeing. Skip this whole paragraph if you care about that. The character type that's embodied by Ichimaru Gin, who's presented as a slimy bastard who sucks up to the main villain and does some incredibly heinous things in the service of that villain, but his core motivation has always been to take revenge against that villain because that villain hurt someone he cared about so long ago the villain doesn't even remember. He looks calm and collected on the surface, a perfect underling for the villain, but inside? There's nothing but rage at what the villain did to someone he cared a lot about, and he's playing an extremely long game to get revenge.

I really like underlings of villains who have their own motivations, *especially* if those motivations cause them to suddenly turn on the villain.

Hell, I just generally like characters who obviously have their own motivations to be part of the heroic or villainous team and *that's* what's really driving them. Han Solo's another good example, but on the heroic side: he sticks around because he wants to get paid, and it's a massive character moment for him in Episode IV (the first Star Wars movie) when he decides to turn his ship around and take part in the Battle Of Yavin IV *after* getting paid, because he's come to actually like these people he's so far just fought alongside for a paycheck.

I love character moments like that. They don't have to be twists, although they usually are, just something that displays a character has agency and is acting based on their own moral/philosophical principles instead of because they got assigned to the protagonist or antagonist team at the casting call.",1,2025-07-19 18:40:37+00:00,LOW,1.0,200.56849537037036,what are your favorite character dynamics/tropes?

To your point, I would think complex rock music based on classical literature themes could certainly be considered as well as sci-fi or other overarching themes.

With that, I can’t see putting The Who’s “Tommy” into the prog rock category given the structure of the music even though obviously it tells a story and has a concept for the album as it’s a musical, and I can’t see putting many musicals into a prog rock category.

Micheal Penn's books of sources on Syriac Christianity and When Christians Met Muslims are a nice intro to dip into.

It's not about 'evidence' from the Qur'an, ignore the Qur'an.

It's like saying prove the 4th Harry Potter movie doesn't claim it's fiction internally.....if you've been reading the Torah, Aurthur and Merlin, Lord of the Rings, Narnia etc you will understand the genre it's operating in and that Harry can be the virgin magus messiah that touches death for the new generation, just like Jesus or Bilbo Baggins were before.

If you read all the stuff before the Qur'an you will know before you even open it that playing with Moses narratives is how messages are conveyed over the campfire or whatever.

If you ignore everything prior to the Qur'an you are gonna really, really struggle to understand anything imo.

For example Maryam is perhaps the most important person in the entire Qur'an in my reading, the greatest of all time, but to understand the Marioligy of the Qur'an you need some context:

Mary in the Qur’an - Muna Tatari &amp; Klaus von Stosch (2021):

&gt;""It is intriguing to note at this point that the Qurʾan ignores this tradition; in so doing, it insists upon linking Mariology to Christology and sets its face against any treatment of Mariology in isolation. However, we do not want to pre-empt our study of the Qurʾan here. Besides, for all its lack of interest in the death of Mary, the image of her presented in **the Qurʾan is unequivocally engaged in dialogue with the apocryphal literature of Christianity**.""

If you are not steeped in Tewahedo, Syriac, Orthodox and more Mariologies of the second to seventh centuries and reading the apocryphal literature it's in dialogue with one might end up crafting a novel hyssop pure mother goddess of war instead like Aisha who isn't even mentioned in the Qur'an....but to understand Aisha you are gonna need stuff like the Gospel of James and many more imo.",3,2026-01-16 06:03:55+00:00,HIGH,13.0,701.5274189814814,"Born Muslim, studying biology, and trying to understand how people actually reason their way to faith"

I think while there perhaps is some stereotyping (maybe not the right word in this case) involved with the Dwarves, which I'm still not sure if Tolkien meant or not, it is understandable to question given literature from that time period. Additionally, I think people have a tendency to look for connections because throughout history Dwarves, Goblins, etc have been paralleled to Jews. However, Tolkien is the least of our troubles, and if anything paints Dwarves in a positive light.

The parallel between Dwarves longing for their lost homes and Jewish history is actually really interesting. Whether on purpose or not, Tolkien did describe the Dwarves as being ""I think of the 'Dwarves' like Jews: at once native and alien in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue..."" While he didn't explicitly compare the Dwarves' displacement to Jewish exile directly, it definitely seems to be a theme, especially given Tolkien was a highly religious man and based his stories a lot around this.

Your initial questions were completely valid and it's always worth examining these portrayals critically. Based on what I've seen I really doubt Tolkien held animosity toward Jews, and if anything, defended us (as we called us gifted people ☺️), but again we don't know 100% for certain, however, his letter to the Nazi's is pretty powerful.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",3,2025-03-19 01:41:52+00:00,LOW,1.0,1.7237847222222222,J.R.R Tolkien’s response to a publishing house in Nazi Germany inquiring whether he was Jewish or not.

Twice last week, completely independent of each other, I've been in discussions with Americans who are planning to get second citizenships based on ancestry.  They got interested in the past two weeks.

There's more on that front, but I'm starting to get a little cautious about too much personal information in the event that Reddit is taken over and data mined by Elon Musk's crappy AI.  And yes, I know Reddit is private, but come on - do you honestly think DOGE and ""Big Balls"" will stop at the Federal government?  YESTERDAY, Musk tried to throw sand in the gears of his competition at Open AI absolutely while leaning on his new position as de facto President of the United States, and earlier this week, the new Attorney General threatened private companies for having policies the Administration doesn't like.  I think Redditors need to start considering these possibilities - and Reddit in finding ways to ""accidentally"" delete data that might be used against its users.  Just a thought.

So just pick something. What does a glimpse of everyday life look like. How about what does a funeral look like in that world? Just literally write a funeral and put a spin on it.

You know how funerals work in the real world: do something kind of shocking to us in the real world but ordinary in your setting. Or maybe a wedding or something where someone gets ritually murdered at the end and they move on like nothing happened.

This is essentially the technique Tolkien uses at the beginning of the Fellowship of the Ring with Bilbo's birthday, the Bilbo's age is casually celebrated but the lifespan of hobbits is shocking to the reader. Start thinking like that.

To zoom out more, what will help is to read a lot of books and a get of sense of types of openings. There's that style of opening, there's some worldbuilding cryptic preamble kind of opening, there's the flashy one-liner kind of opening, there's an environmental/nature's wrath kind of opening, the cold open action sequence, etc.

You start building an repertoire and a toolkit of how to really write.

6aa5fdd0-0720-4b9b-93b0-1beb75c3a260,1jhzn5w,movies,Ca_Marched,"Per chatgpt - ""*Spirited Away* isn’t considered **High Fantasy** because of several key differences in its structure and themes when compared to the classic characteristics of high fantasy. Here’s why:

1. **Setting**:
   * **High Fantasy** usually takes place in an entirely fictional, self-contained world (like Middle-earth in *The Lord of the Rings* or Westeros in *A Song of Ice and Fire*). These worlds are often complex, with their own rules, histories, and cultures.
   * In contrast, *Spirited Away* takes place in a world that is largely an alternate dimension or a magical version of the real world, rather than a completely separate, built-from-scratch universe. The story begins in a very real-world setting (Chihiro’s move to a new home) and then transitions to a magical bathhouse that exists in a world where spirits, gods, and mythical beings coexist with elements of our world.
2. **Scope of the Story**:
   * **High Fantasy** typically involves grand, world-changing stakes—wars, large-scale quests, or battles between good and evil. It's often centered on epic heroes or chosen ones tasked with saving the world.
   * *Spirited Away* focuses more on a personal journey. Chihiro's quest is about her growth, survival, and eventual escape from a magical realm. While the magical world she enters is vibrant and full of strange beings, the stakes are more intimate and grounded in her personal experience, rather than the fate of the world itself.
3. **Magic and Worldbuilding**:
   * **High Fantasy** often involves a detailed, structured system of magic, with defined rules and laws that govern its use. The worldbuilding is typically expansive, involving multiple kingdoms, races, and histories.
   * While *Spirited Away* does include magic, it's not as systematically explored as in high fantasy. The magical world of *Spirited Away* is more whimsical and dreamlike, with fantastical elements that are more about atmosphere and wonder than about a logical, rule-based system.
4. **Tone and Themes**:
   * **High Fantasy** often has a more serious tone, with themes of heroism, epic battles, and the struggle between good and evil.
   * *Spirited Away* has a more whimsical, surreal, and at times eerie tone. The themes focus more on personal growth, the transition from childhood to adulthood, and the discovery of one's inner strength, rather than epic battles or saving the world.

In short, *Spirited Away* doesn’t fit the **High Fantasy** mold because it’s more focused on personal, emotional development in a fantastical world that blends magical realism and fairy tale elements. It's much more grounded in a particular cultural and moral framework (drawing heavily on Japanese folklore and Shinto beliefs) rather than the grand, often universal scope of high fantasy.""",1,2025-03-23 23:26:48+00:00,LOW,1.0,5.474363425925926,Best high fantasy films besides LoTR?

Let me explain: no one, but no one, says the word ""okay""--which is EXTREMELY recent--in A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones. The language in GOT is somewhat less stilted than in ASOAIF, but it's still quite formal. Same for Lord of the Rings, and a lot of other fantasy books. When it comes to fantasy video games, though--Baldur's Gate III, Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, Fire Emblem: Three Houses--the language is slightly less formal, and they do sound generally more modern, on a sliding scale. People do say ""yeah"" and ""okay"" and whatnot in Dragon Age &amp; FE3H in particular.

Interestingly enough, in FE3H, at least one character says ""geez""--which brings up SO MANY QUESTIONS. Okay, mostly it's just ""so the English-language localisers don't know where that word comes from, right?"", but I'd love for someone to use in-world context to explain to me how that word works in Fodlan.

2) Misspelling characters' names, consistently.

Also, with Barduil in particular, there's a lot of ""Thranduil's poor wife (sobbing emoji)"" when she is not once mentioned or even alluded to in any of his writing and we can only assume she existed at some point because Legolas exists, and a lot of ""but he's straight"" because that's apparently the default sexuality characters who aren't shown in a relationship must be. My observation is that these tend to be extremely heterosexual women who are deeply and obsessively attracted to him and they feel threatened or disgusted by people headcanoning him as bisexual or even gay because they're using their concept of his wife as their self insert. I am not exaggerating, I have pressed them on why they are commenting on every piece of Barduil fanwork they can find and their answers always boil down to ""i think it's gross and it makes me uncomfortable,"" so just plain homophobia.

1. I don’t ticket prices are the problem in my area. The tickets seem to be somewhat affordable. It’s just that compared to waiting for it come out on streaming the real price is just waiting. 

2. A lot of theaters had to adapt from the old way they did seating. In my area the showcase cinemas changed from old cinema seats to bigger more comfortable theatre chairs. 

3. I think there is a large enough variety I just don’t think a lot of movies are done that well right now. It’s a lot of slop. 

4. Streaming of course affected my want to go out and view movies. Real talk the only bonus of seeing a movie in theaters was the tasty popcorn. I already have a decent tv in my room and can watch in the comfort of my home months later. 

5. Much easier to wait for streaming. Unless it’s something I really care about or a line of movies that are related/sequential it feels like I can just wait out the clock for them to come on a streaming service. Realistically if you have Hulu + Netflix + Paramount + you will get most movies 3-12 months after they premiered.  

Realistically the three streaming services (not including Disney+) all together might cost you 60$ a month for ad free best quality content. That being said a day at the movies is like anywhere from 15-25$. The real price as mentioned early is waiting. 

Now there are theaters that are having a little bit of success but those theaters changed how they did things. Bigger seats/real nice theater seats, waiter/waitresses and or restaurant food you can order, and having things other than movies that are playing now being shown. Ex: LOTR watch party.",2,2025-03-13 12:08:31+00:00,HIGH,3.0,125.95858796296297,"""Why Are Movie Theaters Dying"" Forum Discussion"

Inspiration, copyright infringement and copying are all VERY distinct from each other, if you recognize this as a stumbling block for your writing, I think you need to define each definition.

To be inspired is fine. Literally all creation takes inspiration, even the stories that you hold as classics likely took inspiration from an idea or concept that blossomed into a body of work.

Copyright Infringement and plagiarism are 1 in the same in my book. It’s a blatant (often unapologetic) attempt to capitalize on massively successful prior works. The courts usually catch these guys but not soon enough.

Copying is the act many view as their inspiration being *bad* or *improper*. This is like writing a sci-fi story with space wizards preserving peace &amp; security against evil forces out to destroy democracy and blow up planets. To escape the copy faze you need to recognize the inspiration to copy transitions in your writing, stop and think about how to put your own spin on the subject. That’s how all the modern greats came to be (imo).

&gt;When is it just inspiration and when is mindless and unoriginal imitation? 

You’ve got to recognize this moment. Many think that writing a hip hop song, writing a movie script or wanting to be a director (like Scorcese) is copying in and of itself. It’s all about the execution. Style is undeniable and that’s what truly oozes in a creative’s work. By the time the title credits roll and the camera starts moving you know what you’re in for.

&gt;When is it just plagiarizing?

This is theft. If I write a book about a group of hermits called Hommits that join a reclusive king called Faragorn and an elf named Regotas I’m plagiarizing Tolkien’s Lord of The Rings. ESPECIALLY if I give no indication that Tolkien inspired the work. This is 1 reason I dislike Martin’s A Song of Ice And Fire book series (though he does take lengths to imprint his worldview in the story).

I really could go on but as the writer it truly is on you to recognize and avoid acts like plagiarism at all costs. Copying and inspiration are foolish endeavors to avoid, what peaked your curiosity does not take precedent in and of itself over your own work.

Why can you only think in extremes ? All i said, is give up to punish yourself for the wrongdoings of others you have zero influence upon with suffering. Nothing of that requires you to act less and put the head in the sand. Rather the opposite, since living in the now instead a doomed future gives you a lot more control over what you can possibly achieve. Instead doing something most of you just sit smoking and waiting for the end (orcs) while doom scrolling. 

 In Lotr they didn't had zero influence the entire time, they got their turning point of influence right in the beginning by having the one ring. What's your ring of power that gives you hope ? Why don't you go to Mt Doom and end the misery ?

&gt;Part of making the most out of the time we have is focusing on the big problems and trying to do something about them. What more meaningful thing is there to do in life?

How about actually living your life, making the best of every single moment and working on becoming a better self, and not living in fear of a future you can't prevent that hinders you from enjoying the good things in your vicinity because you suffer? If everyone would do that the world wouldn't have these problems in the first place.

2 Corinthians 10:5 (KJV)
Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

This is one to memorize as well and is easier to than it looks. 

Jesus loves you more than you can know man. We can't comprehend the type of love he has for us. People go mad trying too. Or they become CS Lewis or Tolkien and end up making Lord of The Rings.

Moby Dick is largely about Ahab's obsession over the whale rather than the whale itself. The Lord of the Rings has more to do with the adventures of the Fellowship than with Sauron.

San is still a very important character in the film, though. I'd argue she's much more actively involved than the aforementioned, but you'll note that the film is called Mononoke Hime, not San Hime.

These sorts of titles, with their titular character, often anchor to an idea or mythology more than to the character themselves. The idea or perception of the Princess Mononoke in the story’s world, her central role in the conflict between human progress and nature, is pervasive. While Sauron is a distant, mythological force, San, who is human but was raised by wolves, fully embodies the film’s central themes, both within the story itself and in the world that perceives her as a legendary figure.

Ashitaka is the character we follow for most of the film, but he is also an outsider entering an already unfolding story. The beginning of the film does a great job of establishing the lore surrounding Mononoke Hime and the rising tensions between various forces. Because he is an outsider, he presents both sides of the conflict to the audience from a neutral perspective. His role in the story is that of a catalyst and mediator; his journey brings the conflict to a head and ultimately helps restore balance.",2,2025-03-12 06:36:21+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.0,Hayao Miyazaki's 'Princess Mononoke' is Getting a New 4K Restoration Released Exclusively in IMAX on March 26 - Official Trailer

In ROTK tho, there's an explosion in Minus Morgal (Cirith Ungol pass)- the one with the crazy, vertical stairs that Sam, Frodo, and Gollum climbed while some of Mordor's troops endlessly marched below. The shot of blinding color followed by the sonic boom and the Witch King's (head Nazgul creature) cries was *really intense* in the theater. 

The various battle cries and especially the different armies' horns (Rohan's horn to line up the calvary is my fave).  The clanging of sword (""Ride Now!"") against lance, the thundering steps of oliphants. 

It's subtle, but there's a whoosh noise that Gandalf's staff makes when he races on horseback to protect the soldiers returning to Minus Tirith.

Eowyn is such a complex character. She’s the princess of Rohan, she’s got tons of responsibilities, responsibilities that she keeps and because of the situation Rohan is in at the start of the second movie she’s *trapped*. Her cousins is dead, her brother banished, her uncle impaired and the villain behind it, the snake in control of her uncle’s court *fancies* her. She knows it, she wants out and she spends two movies working to find a way out. 

She falls in love with Aragorn, who respects her as Rohan’s princess but also as a skilled fighter in her own right. Aragorn who has her male relatives’ respect, who is of high birth, wo is friendly and talks to her without pity or belittlement. Aragorn, who is a *genuine option* for her to marry, who would take her away from her situation because he has responsibilities and elsewhere and as his wife she’d go with him. 

But Aragorn loves Arwen and Eowyn recognizes that and takes it with grace instead of drama or unreasonable grief. She loves him but he’s not *everything* to her. She’s independent, she’s got other options. 

Those options might be secretly joining the army and following her brother and uncle into a hopeless battle, preferring her likely death on the battlefield to remaining behind, forever trapped in her position by dint of being the only royal left in Rohan, but she’s got them. And she ends up doing well, she ends up showing exactly how good she is and ending the one threat on the battlefield that was prophesied to be unkillable by any ‘man’. (Incidentally, the “I am no man” sentence? Peak.) Her uncle recognizes her and her deeds before he dies and while it gets cut in the movies Eowyn finds healing and a reason to live while recovering from her wounds. 

Arwen gets much less screen time. Her role, for the most part, is being Aragorn’s love. But she’s an immortal elf and Aragorn a human man, she chooses love and her own destiny over the blissful eternity promised to the elves in their lands across the sea. Even when her father pushes her to sail, when he manipulates her into agreeing by asking her “don’t I have your love as well?” she rallies and turns around, forsaking her immortal life for the *chance* to live with the one she choose to give her heart to. And her ultimate reasoning? “It was my choice.” That’s such a powerful sentence. Because it *is* her choice, it’s every woman’s choice, no one should get to chose *for* them.

They are overwhelmingly outnumbered, and very old men and very young boys as young as fourteen are being outfitted with armor and weapons.

That was taken directly from history. It is exactly what Hitler did near the end of the war. Germany had been bombed to rubble.

At the paragraph level and above? Sure. Most of my favorite stories open confidently, even with a swagger. 

To pick an example at random, my favorite Hemingway short story is *The Capital of the World.* It's a tragic story. He opens it with a joke. This is not the act of a timid writer.

We tend to take people at their word: if they seem genuinely confident, we assume they have plenty to be confident *about.* If they lack confidence or their confidence seems fake, we assume there's a good reason for that, too. This is mostly unconscious on the reader's part.

One bad habit (sometimes but not always related to weak confidence) is to try to *convince* the reader of things they don't need to be convinced of. Stories work largely through unsupported assertions. When a story opens, ""In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit,"" the reader believes it at once. They don't know exactly what it *means,* but they believe it. It's time to move straight on to what kind of hole, and what's a Hobbit, anyway? 

Storytelling uses a lot of unsupported assertions: things that are true because we said so. This works great: we know the story and the readers don't, so they expect to take our word for it. But when we over-explain, we sow the seeds of doubt.

In sales, this is called, ""Selling past the close."" When the customer says, ""I'll buy it,"" you're supposed to shut up and take their money. If you keep chattering on about how wonderful the product is, you might raise doubts they didn't have before. They may well back out of the deal even when, if you'd kept your mouth shut, they would have been delighted with the product.

Watch the end of LOTR3 Return Of The King very closely.

Capitalism will not allow itself to die. At the very pinnacle of Capitalism is it's Power, influence and ability to corrupt others. 

At the end of Return Of The King:

Frodo is slow, exhausted and resigned with his task - to destroy the ring of power. 

""Destroy it""

""Go on ! NOW !""

""Throw it in the Fire""

Samwise implores. 

All this time, Frodo wrestles with the task of dropping the Ring from his left hand.

...then a distraught Samwise gives Frodo one instruction that ends the internal debate altogether:

Samwise tells him to just ""LET IT GO!""

The Ring of Power speaks to Frodo.

We watch it overpower and corrupt him.

The Ring of Power overwhelms Frodo and takes command of him. 

""The Ring is mine"" is the projection of Absolute Power....

I think your question may have a flawed premise. You're thinking of positive masculinity as a way of teaching your son to become a good man. But:

- the good men, like Aragorn, aren't always acting ""masculine"" in a traditional sense. Aragorn takes care of others, an attribute traditionally associated with women. By letting your son know he can learn from both male and female characters, you might be giving him a better goal: being a good -person-. For example, I recently read Jane Eyre and I Capture the Castle (by Dodie Smith). Both stories have their narrators define and describe an incredible amount of their thoughts about people and situations. As a guy, I think that's something I want (need?) to do better. 

- stories, including religious ones, have an antagonist not just to tell a story, but to demonstrate positive behavior through contrast. Flawed characters serve the same purpose.

Hello!


I'd like some recommendations for fantasy books or series to read, as I'm in the mood for it, but I don't know what to choose, because...there are so many options. I used to read more in the past, and I want to get back into the habit.


Some things to consider:


- I definitely prefer ""medieval"" fantasy to Sci-Fi, although I like both.


- I love rich lore and world-building, and for it to be an important part of the book or series. I feel that some books that focus much more on the characters than on their world don't really grab me the same way.


- I don't mind humor, but I prefer humor that isn't too much ""contemporary"". I don't know if I'm explaining myself well. I like the humor, the memes, etc of our current time, but not in a fantasy world, or at least not too mich of that.


- I don't mind if it's more ""dark"" or ""grim,"" but in general, I like the balance between dark and lighter moments.


- My all-time favorite, TBH the first thing I read as a child: Lord of the Rings and everything related to The Middle-Earth, because of the elegance of its lore.


- I don't like Sanderson very much. I've read about seven books: Elantris, the first three of Mistborn, and Stormlight, and I don't think they are for me.


- I'm currently reading The Realm of the Elderlings (I've finished The Farseer Trilogy), but I need a break. I loved the first book, but I struggled with the last one in that trilogy for various reasons that aren't relevant here. But I'll eventually continue it.


- Other books and series that I've enjoyed to varying degrees: Dune, ASOIAF (not all of them, but I'll read them in the future), The Witcher (some books more than others), and The Kingkiller Chronicle.

Its some vague beliefs, a few naming conventions and a prophecy. 
That's where I want OP to be concrete: have an explanation on how the religion started, where and why, how did it spread, and how does it organise itself. 

With Tolkien and Lewis, my point is a different one. Not about the structure of the religion in the narrative's present day, but about presenting the core beliefs and ethics. Replaying the gospels is a heavy handed approach, even if it can be charming. The [christian] characters in OPs narrative should live christian ethics in action, instead of appealing to the Gospel according to fantasy-Luke.",1,2026-01-22 07:09:28+00:00,LOW,3.0,292.6521875,"How to write ""Faux"" Catholicism/Christianity in fantasy?"

You talking about LOTR reminded me about Lord of the Rings: Conquest. A bit old but it worked kinda like star wars battlefront 2. Might have some moments :p but I don't remember properly. It's a 3rd person action.

About star wars battlefront 2... You being a soldier and meeting hero in battle might be intimidating. The start of the match especially can bring quite a hype, the way all the vehicles start to move at the same time and everyone moves in different positions. The chaos is there xD.

Star wars republic commando also kinda pushes you to the limit since you are just a squad of 4 but if you want massive battles this one is not for you. There are less enemies but are often quite strong and you gotta know how to beat em. It's quite adventurous and the epicness comes from you doing badass things with your squad trying to make a difference. It's an fps shooter.

Peter Jackson and the team knew they couldn't fit all of that into movies, but they did an excellent job and I was surprised how many Easter eggs I found in the movie after reading the books!

For a very long time after I left Christianity back in 2008, I had trouble watching or reading anything having to do with Lord of the Rings because the folk who initially got me into it in the first place were hardcore Christians. The fuckers basically spoiled it for me. It shows how distasteful associations with a group of people can ruin something for you.

But as time ground forward, and about 10 years had passed, I revisited all of the movies and watched the new Hobbit trilogy. I look at everything with a completely different lens now, and I'm immensely grateful for that.

With Lord of the Rings, if you take any magic, mysticism, or the greater cosmology out of the picture, it's essentially an ongoing war story, and I look at it through the same perspective as I would with *Band of Brothers*, *The Pacific*, and other similar works. There's an immense amount of death and tragedy in Tolkien's legendarium, but also valor and sacrifice—everything you would expect in a very long-running story about the struggle to remain free.

It's a great irony that current Christians who cling to Lord of the Rings and claim it as a Christian work fail to look at the power of Gandalf's red-jeweled ring, Narya: It wielded the power to inspire others to resist tyranny, domination, and despair. They're obviously not looking around at the current world around them. We should *all* be resisting tyranny, domination, and despair—but Christians themselves are the source of these evils right now.",5,2026-01-14 05:06:36+00:00,LOW,1.0,31.566805555555554,Movies and TV hit different

After consuming the research of Yonatan Adler and Gad Barnea on the origin of biblical Judaism, you definitely get the picture of a literary elite that assembled a national Epos at the library of Alexandria, which became the Hebrew bible, instrumental in converting the Jewish people to a Moses-centered Judaism. To my ears, it sounded like writing books based on older material (probably from both history and legend and myth), and forming a grand narative that could bolster a consoladating nationalism needed at that time. 

Reminded me of how Tolkien was inspired by this really old verse about a ring or rings, which presumably inspired Lord of the Rings. And in his corpus were different genres of books, like the bible: Silmarillion, The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, Unfinished Tales, etc. Tolkien also attempted to depict Middle Earth as England’s origin story, which was later toned down though. The Hebrew bible became the origin story of Israel*, a story that seemed to be previously unknown to the greater Jewish populace before the later half of 3rd century BCE.

Let me explain this circular word salad. 

The brain processes a near-infinite amount of signals. The 100 million or so neurons in the system pass along information like an old-time firefighter bucket brigade passing water. 

One end of a neuron reacts to the right concentration of neurochemicals (domapine, oxytocin, endorphins, etc.). This triggers the neuron to send a charged ion to the other side like a microscopic railgun, where it reacts to release neurochemicals and pass the chemical message along. 

These pulses can reach up to 100hz (times per second) and each neuron works with a full palette of different neurochemicals. Add it all up, and your brain ends up processing up to 10 billion neurons per second. 

If you were to actually reach that number, that would be one hell of a sensory trip. High as a kite. But reinforced pathways require a lower concentration of neurochemical to fire, while less-used paths reset to a baseline. 

It's like water eroding a mountainside, just replacing dissolution with a different chemical reaction. This sets the scale for understanding the psychological concept of processing—they use the term bias, which is Latin for slope. 

Your experience started with the runoff of your parents' decisions toward you, shaping how you perceived the world. The amygdala section of your brain processs this flood of signals and develops patterns, with the goal of finding the most imminent danger to focus on. 

You can recognize a face far more easily than you can draw one, for example, including emotional cues to prepare you to pursue, ignore, fight, or flee. [Scary Bilbo Baggins](https://youtube.com/shorts/OC7Ox29VVkE?si=fG3sPVlg2LeNyfqm) is a good example of all the subtle and not-so-subtle sensory cues involved in the process.

Mormons deal with two types of unhealthy emotional reactions. There are the artificial indoctrinaltion canals that force psychologically safe experiences into a narrow funnel over time. And then there are the sudden trauma landslides that cut across the landscape, tying everyday experiences to fight-or-flight responses like anger and fear.

Whether your ongoing experience slowly undercuts the banks of the canal or rips through the patch job on old trauma, both scenarios lead to painful cognitive dissonance as the conscious mind tries to resolve where the danger comes from. 

Are you too weak to be a good Mormon (my instinctive conclusion for those decades of my life)? Are you irreparably broken off from salvation due to trauma responses? Is Mormonism an evil puppet master, making us dance? 

Without new experience to process, your thoughts circle through the same neurochemical tracks, proving to yourself that your current state will extend forever because it has always been this way. One unbroken and unbreakable loop of anger and hurt. 

But introduce new sensory information for your brain to process, and it can start updating these old patterns from a place of relative safety. That safety might be a meh existence now instead of the active abuse of your childhood, but even small desensitizations can help your mind accept the possibility of change. 

My parents divorced when I was young. My dad saw me once a month or so for a low-interaction activity like a movie, but he made sure to have dramatic conversations every few years to ask my forgiveness. 

I realized he was more concerned with checking the obedience boxes so he didn't blow his small chance for celestial glory. He expects Jesus to reward him with a life he didn't build with a family he was too afraid to keep.

There is no single thought or lengthy post that can alter the landscape of your mind. But recognizing your reactions and responding with decisions that take your life in a healthier direction can add up.",3,2026-01-04 19:19:46+00:00,LOW,2.0,366.2410300925926,How do I not be Angry

&gt; Scientific facts and miracles found in the Quran

There are zero scientific miracles in the Quran. Everything that's being touted as a scientific miracle falls into one of three categories:

1. It was known long before Mohammed.
2. It is a reinterpretation that lies about the meaning of the verse.
3. It is actually a scientific mistake.

&gt; You cannot replicate like the Quran, and even the Quran says that

And who gets to judge whether it was replicated? If you make somethine similar to the Quran Muslims say it's copying the Quran style, if you make it dissimilar Muslims say it's not a replication of the Quran. It's a heads I win, tail you lose kind of challenge.

&gt; The Quran is not written like a human

Nah, it is written exactly like a human would write it: Containing rules that get abrogated over the 13 years it was being ""revealed"" and containing special rules for the dear leader.

&gt; The Quran has been preserved

So has the code of Hamurabi.

&gt; The Quran has no contradictions

Neither does the phone book, or the Lord Of The Rings.

But in fact the Quran does contain contradictions, for example who said ""Lo! this is verily a knowing wizard""? According to [Quran 26:34](https://quran.com/26/34?translations=20%2C19) it was the pharaoh, and according to  [Quran 7:109](https://quran.com/7/109?translations=20%2C19) it was the people.

&gt; Islam is pretty logical

Lord Of The Rings is more logical than Islam, having a more benevolent god called Eru Iluvatar. Internal logical consistency is easy to achieve.

And in fact Islam is pretty illogical. For example it tries to combine predestination and free will. You are literally aware of this, because you mention it towards the end of your comment. So how can you claim it is logical?

&gt; Things like istikhara prayer and dua working

They don't.

Every time anyone tried to do the leg work to see whether it works they came up with the same result: It works as well as random chance i.e. it does not work.

You had 2 billion Muslims making Dua for Gaza, and it did not work. Funny how Dua only works in cases where random chance would make it work.

&gt; Islam reflecting reality, such as things about the future, how things are, etc

I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. Plenty of blog posts reflect ""how things are"" and plenty also predict the future. See for example Ray Kurtzweil predicting that AI will start to emerge in the mid 2020s and writing about it all the way back in the 1990s.

&gt; Good teachings in Islam

Good teaching such as beat your wife and mutliate your daughters' genitals? Buy slaves and rape them? Yes, very good teachings!

&gt; How could prophet Mohammed SAW not be a legit prophet when he faced so much from preaching Islam?

All cult leaders face persecution. Nothing unique about Mohammed here.

&gt; Science, complex things like life, how things work, things like the universe, everything, how can there not be a creator?

People used to think lightning needed to be thrown by Zeus. Muslims thought only Allah could know when rain will fall (hello weather forecast) or the gender of a baby in the womb (hello ultrasound). We all know better now.

And if you want to study things like life and the universe, perhaps you should take a look at biology and physics. They are actually working on answering the question with real science, not a bullshit answer in the form of ""a magical dude in the sky did it"".

&gt; Islam is taken very seriously by Muslims

Hahahaha! You gotta be joking!

Muslims take their religion so unseriously that most of them literally don't know what their religion says about obvious things.

&gt; A lot of things used in arguments are debunked, for example the idea that 🍇 is ok, or killing innocent people

Any idiot can claim something was ""debunked"". I could say that the idea that Islam does not command killing innocent people is debunked, and you wouldn't believe me either.

Except I can show reciepts: Ibn Taymyah said in the book Al-Sarim Al-Maslul:  [فان مجرد الخروج عن الدين يوجب القتل وان لم يفارق جماعة الناس](https://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84_%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89_%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%85_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%84) Translation: ""**Simply leaving the religion necessitates death**, even if one does not leave the group of people."" So there's killing of an innocent person for thought crimes.

&gt; How is it that everything we do is already written, yet we have free will?

So literally a logical contradiction in the very fabric of your religion, yet you wrote earlier that it is logical?

&gt;Why does God punish people for not being convinced of Islam?

Because Allah was modeled after the concept of a very jealous kind/emperor who would kill people for not kissing his ass.

&gt; Why are there so many interpretations of Islam? Whether in Quran or hadiths, how are you supposed to follow the religion? How are you supposed to follow the right things and follow what God has commanded?

Because Mohammed literally thought the world was ending within a few generation of himself, so he didn't bother making things clear.

He didn't even fucking bother explainig how the Islamic empire should be ruled. Can you imagine a God being so stupid that he lets his religion be mired in political upheaval because his prophet died? And then let the religion split into sunni/shia because of these political issues? Wouldn't a god have a better plan?

&gt; If God can do anything, what about things like making a rock he can't carry?

Yeah the tri-omni god is self contradictory no matter how you turn it. Of course the people who made up these things didn't think them through well enough.

Also note that if God created the rules of logic and can therefore break them (depending on your interpretation of God) then he can create a rock so heavy he can't lift it, and he can lift it. It's illogical, but nobody said that god is constrained by logic, right?

&gt; Why is the Quran the only preserved holy book? Why did the others like the bible get corrupted?

Are you aware of the 10 readings of the Quran? It's not really that well preserved.

&gt; Why isn't making a look alike of Jesus deception? Did God deceive people? Why?

Because Mohammed was copying the local christian legends.

&gt; Without Islam, what explains what's in the afterlife? 

Why do you assume there is an afterlife to begin with? There might just be none.

&gt; What explains the creation of everything

Who knows? We don't know how everything works yet, but that does not mean we just get to say ""god did it"", just as before we understood lightning we didn't get to say ""Zeus did it"".

&gt; Without Islam, how is justice served?

Justice is a human concept. The universe does not owe us justice.

&gt; How did Islam become very widely accepted?

By the sword. There [is a poem](https://shamela.ws/book/96464/75) written about Mohammed by one of his followers:

&gt;دعا المصطفى دهْرا بمكةَ لم يُجَبْ *** وقد لان مِنه جانبٌ وخِطَابُ  
فلما دعا والسيفُ صَلْتٌ بكفِّه *** له أسلموا واستسلموا وأنابوا

Roughly translated:

&gt; The chosen has preached for an age in Mecca without being answered ** and he was lenient in his conduct and speech  
But when he preached with the sword clear in his hand ** to him they submitted, surrendered and repented

So according to Mohammed's own poet the people only submitted when he threatened them with a sword.",5,2026-01-10 08:56:07+00:00,LOW,5.0,328.4153009259259,"I'm a muslim, I'm lowkey struggling with my faith, here are my points"

I thought it was pretty well written and entertaining, especially when there was a dirth of other epic fantasy at the time, but it was a clear knock off of Tolkein.

Brooks later two in the first trilogy, Elfstones and Wishsong, took the world in a new direction and were quite good.

The quadrilogy after that, the Scions of Shannara, were very strong as well.    I enjoyed them thoroughly.

After that the quality of writing dropped and it was pretty clear Brooks was just pumping them out.

The problem is that Wood was 18 when he started filming LotR, th*e* youngest member of the main cast, and it shows.

My baseline barometer of success is getting the piece of filmic art complete.. though I'll quickly get into the financial side. 


I'll say that something like a short film because of its nature is a lot more doable, and also I'll factor in that filmmakers tend to be obsessive whether for good or bad.  

So I would say for a short film to get complete it's probably a 50/50 thing or maybe a 60/40 thing..40 percent being the completion of said film. 

Features are very difficult to logistically complete, so my random guess is that it's probably like if you had a hundred attempts at a feature film to be completed, maybe five might get finished.  

As for money, there are a lot of websites that tell you how to earn money for a short film, however at this point they seldom are a true calling card because of how saturated the indie short film market is, so I feel like it's only realistic to expect to lose money on a short film at this point. 

As for features, 'filmmaker magazine' has an article showing graphs on a small sampling of feature films and their ability to make money--which logically gets smaller as budgets get higher.

So starting with the lowest bracket that they have (films that cost around $50,000 or less) 60% don't recoup their budget.

So I'm going to revise what I think success is because of how tricky it is financially..

I consider success to be earning enough money (ideally from the films themselves) to be able to make multiple films over the years.    

I also think this is a bad industry to start while focusing on lucrative benefits, though if you blow up and become a sensation this could happen..but is also very unlikely. 

So basically the farther out you gauge success, the greater the diminishing returns..but I do believe a completed short with a good story isn't a bad place to start. 

Also, get the audio recording right, and don't be afraid to redub/ADR if the initial recorded sound isn't good. I think that 90% of Lord of the RIngs was ADR'd and that every scene in the post Phantom Menace Star Wars prequels was ADR'd as well.

However, I’ve not seen a high fps ratio for a film set largely in nature and with natural light so I’m intrigued to see how it lands. We are all used to 24fps, but we also now live in a world where everyone holds a camera daily or knows the feeling of it, so perhaps this high frame rate will create a form of “realism” that the dreamy 24fps might not.

8b25c3fe-9476-43da-9688-be5cf3b8b3f1,1phzxxc,cinematography,LucasJackson78,"No, it's not the same thing. The Hobbit was shot at 48fps and \*projected\* at 48fps. The result is a higher quality image. What is being done here is changing the angle of the shutter so that each frame is exposed for a smaller amount of time than what is typical, resulting in a sharper image that can feel like it has a subtle stutter. 

What bothers the human eye is that 1) this is not typical film language. The same way that we have different expectations when something is in slow motion -  ie it's meditative, or we're moving into the interior life of a character, or it is a pivotal moment - the stutter suggests to us that there is some kind of confilct or heightened action. When that suggestion is not capitalized on it feels confusing, and we're being misled. 

Moreover, because Train Dreams aims to have a timeless quality, using a technique that draws attention to itself also works against the film because all of a sudden we're aware of the artifice. And for what? 

My guess is that early on the DP suggested it - possibly because a smaller shutter angle delivers more texture - and instead of interrogating the effects of it they went with it. They made a horrible decision and it undercut the effectiveness of the film for me. And I think a lot of non-technically aware viewers will feel it - even without being concious of it - and it will create an odd feeling for them and hurt the film's ability to work.

People have been discussing the possibility ROP was written by AI for years.

&gt;I was chatting with a couple of guys who work with AI and they dropped a bombshell on me.

&gt;I had suspected that an AI generator came up with some of Rings of Power’s more cringe-worthy dialog.

&gt;Finrod: *Why does a stone sink? Because it cannot look up.*

&gt;That line is exactly the kind of thing an AI generator comes up with. The words can be made to sound like wisdom by an actor trying his damndest but give it any kind of sapient thought and it falls into the uncanny valley.

&gt;But I didn’t think the whole thing was written that way.

&gt;But those AI guys I chatted with are convinced that a new Amazon AI wrote the entire thing. That any human involvement at all was only there to sand off edges that were just too rough.

&gt;The big tell for them is the number of things that are produced by a mind that simply doesn’t know any better. Like Galadriel going for a swim in the middle of the ocean or the townspeople giving up their easily defendable castle to move back to their completely indefensible town. It was something that happened and it had dramatic impact, of a sort, but again taken as a whole the concept falls into the uncanny valley. Every episode had something like this in it. Adar’s rousing “brothers and sisters in our own land” speech was weird and out of place when applied to orcs. And of course “Feed me the meat and give it to me raw.” Every single episode was full of things like this.

&gt;Then there were all of these incongrous and conflicting events, that frequently had me yelling, “didn’t you read your own damn script?” Individual events sound plausible in isolation but can’t be turned into a coherent structure when taken as a whole. Mostly because the AI isn’t looking for that problem. And the Bad Reboot guys may not have been allowed to correct it. I could understand a couple of frustrated Hollywood nobodies being willing to sign a suicide before reading NDA if it got them something made and they could take credit for it. A high-level failure is still high level, people will be returning their calls.

&gt;Was that the real point of Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power just a big experiment by Amazon to see if an entire mega hit could be created by AI?

&gt;Just buy a huge fantasy title give the AI some tidbits and then stand back and let it do it’s thing. Was that what Rangz was?

&gt;Any other company and I would say it’s nuts but this is Amazon.

Are you sure you want to reimagine the music to arguably the greatest and most thoughtfully crafted soundtrack in cinema history? 

What makes it so good is that each character, each place, each theme has its own motif. In the original scene you get both the theme for the shire and the theme for the fellowship introduced for (I think) the first time.

It’s hard to reimagine a single scene for something so iconic, because the audience will already be hearing those themes in their head, so hearing anything else is jarring to the listener. 

For the purpose of showing a portfolio I would try to reimagine music to a scene from a movie that you feel like was week or could be improved. I think you will find few people who think the musical choices in lord of the rings were weak. 

Still a good job though! Just my two cents 

Edit: all that being said, i am sure you have, but truly study the music of those three films, there is no better example of musical storytelling in films. You can literally name every theme that plays as they happen, and you start to notice them mixing or changing as characters develop or places change. [this video](https://youtu.be/e7BkmF8CJpQ?si=MsAcX21WqS4AYe6y) shows a great in depth analysis of many of the themes, but even this is only a drop in the bucket.

Its a bit like Automata in the sense that the credits roll multiple times (8 to be specific) but theyre not really alternate endings you get to choose, they're actually sequential endings that you naturally achieve just by progressing. 

Umineko is a really complex story, and it needs those multiple playthroughs for it to show you all it has to offer. 
Its framed as a murder mystery, played as a debate between mystery and fantasy, and throughout it you're left with a much more impactful and meaningful story and cast of characters than just your run of the mill murder mystery. 

Really the murder mystery, magic, and whole mystery vs fantasy debating is all just 1 big way of delivering a story of deep love and tragedy, suffering, hate, sadness, despair, longing. So many feelings. 
It explores a deeply troubled and disturbed family that hides a great deal of sin behind their nobility, wealth, and internal family conflicts. 

At its heart umineko is a love story, a romance. 
It culminates into the murders of the entire family (this is not a spoiler, don't worry), and as you go through the game, you peal the layers of everything eventually arriving at the killers motives and past, and then everything fits into place perfectly. 

The games most famous and widespread quote is the one that the game constantly repeats:
""Without love it cannot be seen""

Your first credits roll will happen about 20 hours into the game, at which point you have completed chapter 1 (dont forget to do the tea parties and ???? After each chapter)
Now you only have 7 more chapters to go.
So after 20 hours in, your first credit roll, you have about 130 more hours to go. 

In case you arent aware, its a visual novel game. So no gameplay. Just reading, and some of the best music in gaming. It also has one of the biggest soundtracks in gaming, at just over 200 songs. 

Its possibly one of the longest literary works ever written, at around 1,200,000+ words, or just over double the length of LOTR+hobbit, also longer than the entire Harry Potter series, and longer than the king James Bible. 

Don't let the size of umineko intimidate you though. As someone who very recently read it....it goes by too fast. I mean that in the best way possible. I really didn't want it to end. You get into the last few chapters and look back at all that you've read and wished you had spent even longer reading it. 

Its absolutely worth anybodys time despite its length. The emotional payoff alone is worth the length of admission.",2,2026-01-25 19:02:00+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.013819444444444445,Name a game that surprised you how long it was

And I never complained about Pip's lack of role in the post; he had an established role in the first four seasons as the series' punching bag.

46998bb7-1f20-4dea-9bd7-32929b34d324,1qk00vr,writing,southfar2,"Writing has always been overwhelmingly a breadless art. Most writers aren't remembered, we just remember the big names, like Dumas, Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Tolkien, GRRM, Dostoevsky, Rowling, Doyle, King, etc. Provided they are still alive, many among the most famous authors continue to rake in millions, and will probably continue to do so for the rest of their mortal existence. So, for them, it's still ""worth it"", leaving aside that there is probably very little marginal utility for GRRM in raking in another untold number of million USD for *The Winds of Winter* and *A Dream of Spring*, say (if he ever finishes them). 

What I will say is that it will probably be harder for new authors to break into this market, due to two factors, principally:

One is that audiences are shrinking. I don't wholly want to blame this on tiktok, because it's my impression that tiktok and AI slop like Tungtungtung Sahur and Tralalero Tralala, which gives GenAlpha paroxysms of ecstasy, are just the current level of an increasing trend towards non-written entertainment that is no less impactful than, say, the anime wave of the 2000s, TV in general, video games since the 1990s, etc. The end result is that, letter by letter, each successive cohort has been reading less and less than their predecessors. Indeed, reading skills as a whole are declining across much of the western world, there are many countries where a larger and larger portion of younglings are indeed unable to read, or at least to comprehend long-form text meaningfully. This affects current ""elevated"" authors as well, but to a lesser degree, and if they are already successful, lesser or greater, it will probably not ruin their career.

The other is that we can all see that much of the less-good writing will probably be the domain of AI within a few years, and those of us who are under, say, 50-60 will probably even see very high-quality literature produced by AI in our lifetime.

Hypothetically, those two dynamics might interact in some way; young people with their degraded cognition and attention span might get their fix easily from AI-generated slop with high levels of scandalous/arousing/titillating content, thus facilitating an easier introduction of such content, and the phasing-out of the human author, who is comparatively slow, and often loathe to tailor content to the people who ultimately pay for it. However, while this sounds plausible in theory, I think it's not what will happen; I think what will happen is that reading as a medium either disappears completely with regards to non-work related contexts, and long-form texts, for large parts of the population, or that it is retained in non-work related contexts as an auxiliary function to primary visual content; this can be seen in the mass-produced Chinese mini-dramas that have been flooding social media. They offer visual content, with very simple subtitles and text cards, to serve the new generation of audience. None of this offers worthy employment for a writer.

There will probably always be a few seats at the top (a lot of ""coaching"" authors are still huge), but the seats are becoming fewer.",2,2026-01-22 17:43:56+00:00,LOW,3.0,113.20981481481482,Is being a writer still worth it?
dfe966c9-81ae-4c7d-9909-f922fcb2c352,1qjlk2d,writing,SomeOtherTroper," &gt; how far do I really need to go before the reader is going to be like “okay, man, we get it. He did X. Cool, moving on.”

I think an important part of that question is ""how often do you expect your target audience to have read/seen/etc. this, or something similar, done in other fiction, nonfiction, and even firsthand in real life?"", and the more you can expect them to have seen something similar done before, the less justification you need for anything that isn't specific to your version of it.

For instance, I read plenty of wuxia and xianxia. I don't need an explanation for how ""cultivation"" works, unless the author's deliberately doing something very different than the norm with their system (although a barebones explanation might be beneficial for a reader who's new to the genres), and I'll take something as simple as ""he's mastered the [X] Technique"", or even the implication that a character's had training and this isn't their first rodeo, as a justification for a character bouncing off the walls, flying around, and generally doing things that are impossible without wirework and bluescreen stunts. It's all part of the genre, and I signed up for this story as part of the audience for that genre.

However, as a complementary example, when I wrote a cyberpunk story about a motorcycle courier, I needed a justification for why anybody sane in a futuristic setting would need a physical courier to deliver information (usually on flash drives and suchlike) that could just be sent across the modern internet with ease and security. What I came up with was that encryption-breaking technology had advanced to the point that it wasn't a matter of *if* any encrypted transmission would be intercepted and decoded, but simply *how fast* (which was mostly a matter of how much computing power someone was willing to throw at it - essentially, how important they thought it was), so certain sensitive information, trade secrets, and other suchlike *needed* to be transported physically to avoid getting intercepted and decoded. Which meant the interception needed to be physical and people who wanted to know it had to figure out and target the person carrying it, leading to high-speed chases, gunfights in alleys and on the highways, and all sorts of other fun things you want in a cyberpunk-genre work that's going for action, instead of just sending the information encrypted in an email or whatever.

I had to explain it, because it was a core piece of the worldbuilding, and my audience would have the simple expectation from using modern devices and systems that the information they sent was secure (if done properly) - so I had to tell them *why it wasn't in this setting* to justify my main character's profession. And once I had *that* piece of worldbuilding down, along with ""someone is always listening to your signals"", I could then use those to justify some very crazy other things with no questions asked. By contrast, I didn't have to do any real explanation about the folks with metal arms whose punches could hit like a truck, or cybernetic implants and augmentations, and all the rest of that jazz, because those were all such familiar cyberpunk tropes by this point that my audience would take them at face value.

I did still have to explain one-time-pads, because that's a form of encryption that still sort of worked for time-sensitive information where cracking the encryption on one transmission gives you no idea what you have to crack on the next transmission (if correctly executed), so it could be used for things like ATMs and banking stuff where ""someone already used that code"" could be used to block financial transactions - essentially doing the equivalent of changing your credit card number every time you make a financial transaction, according to a list both your card and the bank have, so if someone tries to use the same number afterward for another transaction, it won't work. It's a real thing in the modern day (and some banks currently offer services that generate card numbers that are good for *one* purchase only), but obscure enough that I couldn't rely on people knowing about it, and was a convenient way to dodge anyone asking ""wait a minute, if encryption is broken, then how do credit/debit cards and other non-cash financial transactions still work?""

 &gt; creating a story-bible for my own reference

My advice about this is to get *really* ok with the fact that your readers don't need to know everything in it. It's always a temptation to want everybody to see all the hard work you put in on the backend, but the frontend of the story doesn't need anywhere near all of that to remain consistent and understandable enough for your audience to understand and 'buy into' what you're doing.

Unless you contradict yourself, in which case you will need to explain how whatever you just did still works in the established rules of your setting, or why someone's able to break them with impunity. But if you've got your audience hooked enough by that point, that explanation doesn't need to be immediate.

Even Tolkien, known for describing a lot of things at length, saved a lot of his background setting information for the appendix of The Lord Of The Rings, or it was only published after his death by his son compiling it from Tolkien's notes. You don't need to know how Elvish works for ""say 'friend', and enter"" to fire, because Gandalf knows the right word in Elvish for that particular riddle (once he thinks about it a bit), and the philology of Elvish can just be left in the appendix, while the fact that there *is* a philology of Elvish helped Tolkien keep elven names and terms sounding consistent, even if the readers didn't know the language.

I'm reminded of a quote I read in some book about the making of Star Wars, and specifically about the sets, along the lines of ""it's all plywood until the last coat of paint goes on, and then it's a starship hallway"". They were talking about the sets for the iconic opening sequence in Episode IV, the first movie. Your audience doesn't need to know about all the bracing you used to prop up the outside of a plywood hallway to keep it from falling apart. The point is that they look at it and go ""that's an interior hallway in a starship where an intense fight against boarders is happening"". Your story bible contains all of that 'plywood' and 'external bracing', which helps you keep things consistent *and keep the 'set' from falling apart*, but the readers don't have to see more than the surface for it to be real to them. I know that's a cinema example, but I think the basic principle holds up when transferred to writing: *THE READERS DON'T HAVE TO SEE*.",1,2026-01-22 08:03:39+00:00,LOW,1.0,200.56849537037036,How deeply should my justifications for plot elements go in the interest of alleviating the suspension of disbelief?

I glaze over these because the info dump is boring. A lot of times I'll have an idea of what a character looks like based on their personality, and my conception is actually at odds with the author's description.

I might define a few key characteristics when introducing a character, and some characters have more visual punch than others, but a lot of times I won't describe them at all if it's not really important to the story. (I admit that in fantasy, there are probably more important details in character descriptions because you're establishing so much about their race, class, abilities, etc. In a lot of stuff I write, the main character is probably just a kid in jeans and a T-shirt. But also, if a wizard just kinda looks like Gandalf, paint a quick picture with a few words and I'll get it. I don't need an exact measurement of the length of their beard.)

a685ae65-bda9-42d6-bff9-347f19581fa5,1qj5khi,writing,liminal_reality,"I tend to disregard ""rules"" by default. As a reader, my enjoyment of books dropped off in correlation to concern for rules in the write-o-sphere of the internet. 

Maybe it is because I've studied linguistics and have a few languages (depending on how you count) but to me, language is first and foremost a *tool* of communication. It is good when it communicates and bad when it doesn't. 

GRRM, Wolfe, Peake, Tolkien, Dickens, Austin, Melville, etc. don't become ""bad writers"" because they use ""suddenly"" or other adverbs, or use words other than ""said"" (or only use ""said"" or however the internet is feeling about that word this day) and it seems preposterous to claim it. Hemingway didn't write how half the internet claims he wrote (the man had page-long sentences for god's sake!) and Dickens opened *Bleak House* with a number of moody sentence fragments you might find in a gritty noir of the 50s despite writing in the 1800s and his reputation for endless florid sentences. 

Instead of ""rules"" I have a strong preference for understanding what *linguistic function* each part of the language I am writing in is meant to achieve, as well as how altering that function feels to native speakers, since some alterations read as poetic and some as humorous (which is time and culture-tied). To give an example, the ""rule"" is ""don't use passive voice"" but if you take that as a *rule* without understanding why English has a passive then you have thrown out part of your toolset for communication without knowing why! If you do that, then you can never, actually, write like Hemingway who knew that the passive could be employed to speak of objects being acted upon by their environment or without bringing in agents that have no bearing on the story. You can never write like Tolkien who knew the passive can be employed to avoid naming the subject twice in a single sentence when you want to write an action and its consequence in quick succession. This also gives the sentence a mythic or biblical quality as it was a common feature of English in the past. 

The ""rule"" exists because the function of the passive is to avoid naming the agent of the verb and it is incredibly rare in fiction that the agent is something you want to avoid since they are the actor driving the scene. Your writing will be fine if you follow the ""rule"" but it will be *limited* and not because of a choice you've consciously made and, I think, for that reason, it cannot match the Greats. 

Of course, if you point out that great writers break the rules all the time, most Rules Gurus (who don't understand their rules any better) will just dump some line about how you, ""have to follow the rules in order to break them."" Sometimes, the truth will sneak in and they'll say, ""you have to **understand** the rules before you can break them"" but *they* won't give you any understanding. Just follow the rules.

**Crime:** *Red Harvest* by Dashiell Hammett. A real classic noir novel about a private investigator who has to take on an entire city of gangsters. This book defined the entire genre for decades after it was written and inspired a lot of films.

With crime it's also good to look up Elmore Leonard because his ""10 rules of writing"" really influenced modern fiction (and he's really good!).

**Fantasy:** if you haven't already read JRR Tolkien's *The Fellowship of the Ring*, read that first. It's so good at describing landscape and environment and creating a sense of travelling through a landscape.

If you have read *Fellowship*, George RR Martin's *The Mystery Knight* is a fun introduction to the writing style that made his books so famous, without having to start a giant series.

**Science Fiction:** *Neuromancer* by William Gibson. The story that made the cyberpunk movement famous, this story flows so fast. Gibson is so good at individual sentences and pace.

**LitFic:** *Night Boat to Tangier* by Kevin Barry. It's about two guys waiting at a ferry port to meet one character's estranged daughter, and you don't know what they want or what led to this moment. The tension and character building is amazing.

And, you know, there are all the high school English class classics which are all pretty good if you aren't being *forced* to read them. *To Kill A Mockingbird*, *The Great Gatsby*, etc

**Horror:** *Books of Blood: Volume 1* by Clive Barker. A collection of short stories by Clive Barker, quite a few of which got made into movies. Clive Barker is a really unsubtle writer - he just takes every technique for getting an emotional response out of people and attacks the reader with them one after the other, at maximum intensity :D

**Romance:** I don't think I've read enough romance to recommend anything and know if it's good or not! There's a novel called *Paris, Trance* by Geoff Dyer about a guy looking back at a summer romance from years ago that I really liked, so I guess I'll recommend that (even if it isn't strictly a romance novel, lol). Edit: thinking about it, I also quite enjoyed *Daisy Jones and the Six*, which was a novel that went by really fast.

**""Steamy NSFW erotica"":** *Delta of Venus* by Anais Nin.

Your body is under *constant* attack from a wide variety of threats: Bacteria, viruses, fungi, multicellular parasites (OK, those are probably not so common in wealthy countries), and your own cells going rogue and beginning to divide uncontrollably (cancer).

A well-functioning immune system discovers and deals with almost all of these, usually so quickly and easily that you don't even notice anything.

The HIV virus infects a particular immune cell that plays a key role in at least parts of the hugely complex immune defence system of the human body, making this cell unable to do its job. When HIV becomes AIDS, this means that ridiculously weak diseases and parasites suddenly become dangerous to the person who has AIDS. Diseases and symptoms that are exotic and hard to diagnose because they just *never* hit people with well functioning immune systems [1].

I recently re-watched the HBO drama movie ""And the Band Played On"" about the discovery of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s. Seeing and hearing about all those weird cancers and fungal infections the patients had was frightening. But it's also a really good movie (big and allegedly all-star cast, although I only recognized that guy from Genesis, Patrick Bauchau, and Gandalf). Recommended.

[1] Keep in mind, the immune system has to be finely tuned. It has to correctly identify threats while ignoring non-threats. An immune system that is too aggressive leads to things like allergies, where it reacts to harmless foreign substances (like peanuts), or to auto-immune diseases where the immune system attacks parts of the body itself (like psorias which looks like a mere skin condition but can also cause arthritis, joint problems; it also is or was speculated that the root cause of type 1 diabetes is auto-immune).",6,2026-01-22 09:00:50+00:00,LOW,1.0,173.49780092592593,How do infections kill in cases without an immune response or inflammation?

084be121-ea4e-4296-89b6-4af18cb6ef51,1hyljvk,collapse,TheDailyOculus,"Honestly, I think Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance is the book that changed me the most. Before that I had never really read anything philosophical in nature.

I could only read one or two pages in a sitting, and even that took time. Mostly because nearly every other sentence introduced me to new concepts that I had to repeat over and over again before its meaning became clear. I'd never read anything like it in my life.

But it urged me on and I experienced this..need to understand.. that I'd never had before. As if I was unlocking some hidden secrets about the universe.

Afterwards reality did feel different. My mind was more capable of coherent thinking, of keeping the thread for longer periods of time. I remember my university scores going up after that.

I think it was partly because I now had much more ""stamina"" than before when it came to digesting complex and long-winded literature. In reading that book my mind became more capable in some subconscious way. As if I'd trained it to be able to think more logically, and to consider things much closer than I had before. It taught me how to truly ""contemplate"" issues without distraction.

In Love With the World by yongey mingyur rinpoche taught me a LOT about the Tibetan Buddhist world-view, and that I could in fact train the mind towards fearlessness, selflessness and contentedness. His journey was very inspiring to me.

Alstair Reynolds introduced me to the space opera genre, and I thoroughly loved the journey through his carefully crafted universe. It made me consider our place as a species in space and time in a new light so to speak, and I think that changed me for the better.

I can't recall the exact author, but I became interested in learning more about the memory palace technique by Dominic O'brian, which led me down a rabbit hole. But afterwards I could memorize some 120 latin names in a couple of hours and nailed the test. It felt groundbreaking at the time, and I spent many an hour cursing the education system for not teaching this in kindergarten. Everyone should at least have been introduced to this technique in early school.

Honorable mentions:

Another huge breakthrough came when I was seven and managed to read the lord of the rings, after that reading became my main hobby and I devoured the entire fantasy section at the local library and book shop.

At the age of 11 I forced myself to read Mowgli in English for the first time. After that it became my main language since the English fantasy selection was much broader.",1,2025-01-13 21:59:13+00:00,HIGH,3.0,386.7819328703704,A Contributing Factor.

The combat is different and offers more action. It's a larger game than TW1 and you can easily sink many more hours chasing the lore.

You’re not wrong, however, you’re also wrong. The core gameplay loop of the story is repetitive. The story, side missions, hidden secrets, and character interactions are what make it good. You have to sprinkle in some of that along the way and not marathon the story linearly. It’s more of a role playing game where you set out to live the life and engage with the whole day as an outlaw. If you just want to speedrun a campaign your perception could be valid, but that’s 20% of what the game offers, and is about. That feels more like you’re not interested in the subject material, or engaging with the game as it was designed and built to be experienced. That’s like saying LotR is bad because the good guys win, and it’s cliche they win at every turn despite the impossibilities. Like, sure, you’re not wrong but that’s also the point of the story.

Or they fundamentally aren't qualified to be working on the IP due to background or character. You sorta want certain devs working on certain things; it should never just be ""throw anyone in and it'll work.""

Just as an example: a lot of ongoing live service games (WoW for instance) has roots in heavy metal and 80s and 90s fantasy novels. Not ONE of the devs working on the game today has any interest in any of that and it shows. You can feel how the story went from a fantasy RPG with inspiration from the old Warhammer stuff, LOTR, etc to a fairly generic Disney-esque game that's more fluff than substance.

On the other hand, you have the Diablo devs who quite obviously are very in tune with the genre and game they're working on, and it reflects well in the gameplay, visuals, and soundtrack of D4 (lets ignore the monetization, which they have no influence over).

\- 10k steps a day, increased to 12k in January. I actually listen to audiobooks while on my walks (and only on my walks) so I have something to look forward to. I listened to the entire Lord of The Rings series for the first time, and now I'm reading the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series.

\- Stopped keeping snacks in my place so that way if I truly wanted something, I'd have to exert energy to get it instead of just passively snacking.

\- Besides my weekly Subway sandwich, I only go to restaurants as a social thing now. (Which is still really hard to manage since the restaurants in my town are super delicious and serve big portions). I basically eat a variation of the same 3 meals for most meals, which would drive some people crazy but it works for me because I find not having to chose my meal easier than saying no to something delicious and calorically dense. 

I don't really go to the gym or work out besides Taekwondo and ballet class twice a week each. I've been working on doing pushups too but that's a separate goal lol. I think it just does to show that this process works best when you make small changes that are easy to adapt to so doing what's best for your future is what's easiest.

Lords of the Rings, for example, has a good mix. Sometimes it is 'cried with concern', sometimes it's 'laughter' or sometimes it's just 'said' twice in a row. The last two examples come from what is otherwise almost three pages of straight dialogue, where characters are talking at each other. Putting a tag for each can sometimes dilute the message, and take focus away from the main point of the scene (what characters are saying).

Also, romance tends to focus on these subtle details more - because it's all about relationship, rather than action and furthering the plot with quests. A decent chunk of fanfiction is romance, or may read more like romance if the writer is mainly a romance writer/reader.",33,2025-03-03 17:29:31+00:00,LOW,2.0,327.6940625,Are the tags in dialogues really not necessary for the reader to understand where the author is going with the characters emotions and actions?

Everything is tagged and organized using Picard. I use a modified version of https://community.metabrainz.org/t/repository-for-neat-file-name-string-patterns-and-tagger-script-snippets/2786/156.

My files are setup like:

     \~/Music/A/Artist/(YYYY) Title \[Type - Format\] \[MusicBrainz ID\]/\[side\] Title \[length\]\[Bandwidth\].ext 

eg:

    /Music/Q/Queen/(1973) Queen [12 Inch Vinyl - FLAC] [1783da6a-9315-3602-a488-1738eb733a0f]

      /02. The Wayfarer [4m18s][320+ 96000KHz VBR 2ch].flac

if the album isn’t a studio album, theres an extra folder. eg:

    /Music/B/Bruce Springsteen/Compilation/(1996) The Lost Masters I_ Alone in Colts Neck (The Complete Nebraska Session) [CD - FLAC] [8531e427-495a-443a-8fc3-0dd2ef459c93]
      /01. Nebraska [4m27s][320+ 44100KHz VBR 2ch].flac
    /Music/P/Phil Collins/Singles/(1981) In the Air Tonight [7 Inch Vinyl - FLAC] [e805dd53-9257-4c78-8bff-a95f0cdd767e]
      /A. In the Air Tonight [5m29s][320+ 96000KHz VBR 2ch].flac

I have special categories for:

Compilations Cover Tribute Singles Live EP

If an album contains multiple disks, there’s an extra folder. Eg:

    /Music/M/Michael Jackson/Compilation/(2004) The Ultimate Collection [CD - FLAC] [2d37b204-ed26-3795-9710-1514f0fd931a]
      /Disc 1
        /01. I Want You Back [3m00s][320+ 44100KHz VBR 2ch].flac

For soundtracks it’s: \~/Music/Soundtrack/A/Artist/(YYYY) Title \[Type - Format\] \[MusicBrainz ID\]/\[side\] Title \[length\]\[Bandwidth\].ext

eg.

    /Music/Soundtrack/L/(2001) The Lord of the Rings_ The Fellowship of the Ring - The Complete Recordings [Digital Media - FLAC] [cad73ae7-5966-4de1-bad4-4a603891fd27]
      /Disk 1
        /01. Prologue_ One Ring To Rule Them All [7m15s][320+ 48000KHz VBR 2ch].flac

Been using this for about 5 years and it’s solid.

This setup also works flawlessly with Plex and Prologue.

Once upon a time, the YouTube channel **Our Changing Climate** was making videos about things of such whimsy as the eco-cinematography of *The Revenant* and *The Lord of the Rings*, and espousing the promising alternatives of minimalism and renewable energy.

These days, the titles of their videos are things like *How to End Capitalism*, *How the Rich REALLY Cause Climate Change*, *Why Palestine Must Be Free*, *Why Net Zero is a Scam*, *Why China Isn't the Problem*, *This is Code Red for the Planet*, *Why the United States is Killing the World*, *Why We Need a World Without Cars*, *Capitalism is Killing Us*, and, most directly relevant to this sub, a trilogy of videos called

1. *Is Collapse Coming For Us?*
2. *How to Prevent Collapse*

and, today's video, the answer / conclusion to the previous two:

3) *Have We Surrendered to Collapse?*

In comparison, there's (probably!) not much of anything deep underneath the Santa Monica mountains, so tunneling there might go more smoothly. It'll still take a while, though, because 5.6 uninterrupted miles under the mountains is a long distance to dig in one go.

The Riders of Rohan detain, disarm, interrogate, and escort Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.  Their job was *literally* border security.

When the Fellowship enters Lothlórien, they are stopped at the border, questioned, blindfolded, and only admitted by explicit permission of Galadriel.  Gimli almost causes the Fellowship to be expelled entirely.

Gondor has multiple layered defenses, watchtowers, patrols, beacons, and fortified crossings along the Anduin.  Rohan keeps musters and riding patrols.  Even Bree locks its gates at night.  These are not Mordor only behaviors lol

The hobbits in the Shire is the counterexample.  They have nominal borders and officials which are treated as jokes and not taken seriously at all.  Hobbits believe evil is always somewhere else, so vigilance erodes.  That innocence and complacency is explicitly punished in the Scouring of the Shire.  Tolkien could not have been clearer that neglecting defense because you dislike conflict is a moral failure, not a virtue.

Tolkien opposed domination, dehumanization, and industrial systems that sever responsibility from consequence.  He did not oppose force, borders, or the use of arms against evil.  Aragorn, Faramir, Eomer, and even Frodo all accept that some evils must be resisted with strength or the innocent suffer.

Reducing the themes of the Lord of the Rings to “anti-machines therefore anti-military” is just as shallow as saying Mordor is bad because it has walls.  Tolkien’s moral axis is restraint vs domination, stewardship vs exploitation, vigilance vs complacency.  Not vibes.  Not aesthetics.

Totally anecdotal evidence, but my family and friends opened up to crpgs and high fantasy rpg games in general through BG3. I see us more in the early market stage. DnD did fairly decent with the quality of their movie and I think there's tons of ways that can capture more audience attention to create a bigger market for indepth highfantasy role-playing. That ofcource comes with the nauseating production of things like the lotr prime show, but I think thats going to present itself in any growing market. The show didn't ruin my love for the lotr universe and I don't think a BG3 movie would do that either.

&gt;I know what it feels like to read a novel and at the end of it, feel like you were never in it. I’ve read novels set in New York where I didn’t come across a single Black character. That’s as ridiculous as flying humans and demons on rooftops. It’s just as fantastical. And I’m not just talking about realistic fiction—I’m talking comics, I’m talking sci-fi. It’s a hell of a thing to see the future with people like you not in it. It’s not to say that those stories shouldn’t exist, but that stuff gets exhausting after a while. In a speech at the J.R.R. Tolkien lecture a few years ago, I talked about the pleasure of taking your mythologies for granted—when you get to the point where you have so much representation that you never have to talk about it.
&gt;
&gt;That’s why some people don’t understand why we bring up representation, because of course, they can take theirs for granted. It’s one of the reasons why I went back to reading African mythology, because I wanted to know what it feels like to have that thing so far in the back of my skull that I take it for granted. I see Europeans walking around with their mythologies, even if they don’t know they have them. The average British person doesn’t think about King Arthur much; I wouldn’t expect them to. But they walk around with the myth of Camelot every day.

Is LOTR feminist? As a whole, probably not. But honestly, I am fine with it as long as it isn’t misogynistic, and I don’t think it is. 

Something that I love about LOTR is that it shows a lot of non toxic masculinity. Men in LOTR are allowed to have feelings other than anger, they are vulnerable, they falter, they put in the work to become better, rise above their own insecurities and failings. They can love each other unreservedly. It’s honestly very nice to see. 

As for “the movies should have done better”, they kinda did. They expanded a lot Arwen’s role, and they even gave her a scene that originally belonged to a male character. In the books it’s a male elf called Glorfindel the one who finds Aragorn after Frodo gets stabbed and takes him to Rivendel on horseback.

The claim you've made is that women weren't thought of at all in the creation of this story. That they are an after thought. And while it is true that women make up a minority of the screen time, (and also page time in the books), the women on the screen very clearly *were* thought out.

Their placement and role in the story is intentional, essential as any other character, and fully integrated. Afterthought characters can be removed from the narrative without affecting it beyond the superficial, but this is not the case with any of the female characters in LOTR. They are as essential to the story as any of the male characters, there are just less of them.

The secondary claim you've made in your response to me is that the imbalance between male character screen time and female character screen time is itself problematic. I also disagree with this. The implication is that the absence of representation equates to the presence of antagonism, but that's not the case. It is possible to tell a story with *only* male characters that has nothing negative to say about women or about feminist ideals, and may even have positive things to say, and converse is true with stories that only have female characters.

Page and screen time just can't be translated into an evaluation of either a positive or a negative position. Eowyn's minimal screen time does more to advocate for women's agency and equality than many films with female leads that subtly reinforce patriarchial values.

It's not the time you have, it's what you do with it that matters. LOTR, in both the films and the books, consistently respects and uplifts women every time they appear on the screen/page. Not only that, but it is not idle in the time that it spends on the male characters.

LOTR may not spend a lot of time on female characters, but it *does* spend a lot of time on feminist ideals. LOTR is one of the greatest examples of fiction criticizing traditionally toxic masculine values, while at the same time finding ways to engage with masculinity in a healthy way.

Even from a solely feminist perspective, that isn't nothing.

Even if that's all that LOTR did, female characters being absent entirely, it would still stand out as a distinctly pro-feminist work for its position on so many aspects of toxic masculinity.",1,2026-01-25 01:50:25+00:00,LOW,12.0,327.0751157407407,

I was a devoted reader of the books as a young child and I always found them deeplysatisfying, though it was sad to me that when my husband was reading them aloud to my daughters my younger thought Merry was Mary, a girl hobbit. 

The reason I am not unhappy with the books despite the absence of female representation is that the few characters who do exist are personally powerful people who are not objectified or sexualized in any way. By contrast, Tolkien’s friend C.S. Lewis, an author whom I also love, is a pretty rancid misogynist. He has more female characters who have lots of agency, but he just doesn’t like adult women and this is something unmistakable in his work. He has the zeal of a convert, and is focused on the sin of Eve. 

Tolkien respects women, and felt, somewhat charmingly, that he didn’t know enough about them truly to make good female characters, though he based one, the most beloved, on his wife. His female characters are beautiful without being sexual objects, and they make meaningful choices and even help to save everyone. There is also a sense in which ignoring women is more successful when it comes to not writing sexist novels for authors in the past. I find the complete absence of female characters in William S. Burroughs almost soothing. It’s better than John Updike, right? My other books as a child were the Oz books (everything is too bizarre to even be sexist, but also they are not) and classic SF. Classic SF is so sexist I find it hard to explain, if you are not a reader. Fantasy, also dicey. So, I don’t even feel the need to defend Tolkien on the grounds that he is a product of his time. He is, but he is also not as sexist as movie screentime would suggest. Galadriel is an impossibly powerful being, impossibly old. Unlike any human person, a great warrior, a golden queen.

As a feminist woman, I disagree with this premise.

Eowyn was not a minor role. In the books, she led the Rohirrim in the absence of the king, and in both is the one that got the killing blow on the Witch King. She also played a major role in two of the movies.

The second most powerful being on the side of good was Galadriel, a woman. She gave the Fellowship surcease after the fall of Gandalf, provided numerous gifts to the fellowship, and in the books was single-handedly responsible for the destruction of Dol Guldur, one of the Enemy's key strongholds.

Yes, it does suffer in terms of representation since it's an adaptation of a trilogy written in the 30s and 40s (which was, to be fair, very fair for its day), but I cannot accept the notion that they were an after thought, played minor roles, and/or weren't thought of at all.",1,2026-01-25 01:31:02+00:00,MEDIUM,2.0,56.43622685185185,

Tolkien, who wrote them, was born in 1892 and began to write them in 1937.  He was a professor at Oxford who specialized in Old English, Scandinavian languages and history,  He wrote a translation of Beowulf.  A classic Oxford Don, an academic.

The books were rooted in his experiences in WW I, filtered through his extensive study of Scandinavian myth and legend.  He was a man of his time, with all that implies.  That said, Galadriel was a major character, a Queen, and had powerful magic.  Eowyn was exemplary in her devotion to her father the king and to her people, as well as a hero in her own right on a battlefield she chose to join when it was in no way expected of her.  Arwen's role is great part a Hollywood construct, basically there to provide a love interest.  She is presented as steadfast in her love and willing to sacrifice her life among her immortal elven kin in order to stay with her chosen lover even though she knew she would witness him growing old and die while she remained young.  The movie did add a bit more for the female characters, small as their roles were.

I don't find LOTR misogynistic, although the story is about a brotherhood of warriors fighting against a great evil. It is certainly male centric.  It is basically an epic tale of doing your duty in the face of fearful, near insurmountable odds, and this applies to both the male and female characters.

I'm not sure I understand what the issue is.  There are few women in this particular story, and taking issue with it seems... picky?  It's like complaining about how how few good male roles there were in ""The Devil Wears Prada"".  Both are fine films, but they are what they are.  It isn't lack of representation, it's the type of story being told.  If it's a type of story which isn't for you, that's fair and certainly your choice to make.

To me, lack of representation of women is a bit weak as a criticism but I can’t 100% put my finger on why. But overall, you’re not obligated to like them. A lot of men really like those films and them defending it won’t be like 100% logical or reasoned or anything, just defensiveness.

First, your view of science and evolution is incomplete and simplified.  Your teachers and those writing textbooks do not understand either, if they are anything like those I encountered.  The same is true for those teaching you about Christianity and the Bible.  This is not to criticize either their knowledge nor what they are teaching you.  Things are normally taught that way and layer upon layer one gets closer to real information.  This information is so complicated and long that simplification is needed.

For example, we are all taught 1+1=2.  Fine as far as that goes.  Also a proper start.  But in real life we almost never have integers and 1 may be 0.51, so 1+1 might be 1.  (0.51 + 0.51 = 1.02) Also 1+1 might be two sets of 1 and no sets of 2.  One apple plus one orange may well not give us two of anything, just one apple and one orange.

Discussing evolution, let’s broaden the perspective past what beginning and intermediate biology books say.  Life did not begin with a single called organism.  Life existed long before life had a cellular wall, a containing membrane, let alone a phosphate bilayer membrane.  Lots of disagreement among scientists as to what would constitute the first life: self replicating molecules.  The same is true for the classifications of species - not the neat, proper and fully agreed tables and charts one is presented,

Science is just the organized and systematic expression of as good of a fit of accepted observations as we have.  The popular press has reports that the new findings of the Webb telescope “changes everything,” or a new fossil shows evolution teachings are wrong.  This is simply incorrect and shows a lack of understanding that science is just the best theory we have with what we have seen so far.  Often lots of observations have to be left out, as no theory includes all observations.

Observations belong to the realm of circumstantial evidence: one looks at an old fossil of a creature similar to an existing one and suggests that perhaps the old fossilized creature evolved into the existing creature.  No one observed the change and related what they saw.  This would be direct evidence.

So, from a truth perspective, science is not true, nor can it ever be true.   Evolution is exclusively or almost exclusively circumstantial evidence.  It can be and often is useful, sometimes very useful.

Let’s move to the basic property of evolution - the change in structures and species of life.  What makes something alive?  If I take all the chemicals necessary for life, say a fly, that is dead, we can never make it alive again.  The theory of evolution explains things from a point part of the way past the beginning to now, with lots of gaps and revisions as new observations occur.  This may be a useful way to organize and summarize observations, making them easier to remember and generalize.

Rather than talking about Christianity, perhaps it is better to speak of the Bible and the part of the Bible, in Genesis that relates to creation, as the idea of Christianity can be more squishy and nebulous.  This part of the Bible is based on what God told Moses and is direct evidence.  God says I was there and I did this and saw that.

Now, it appears that the direct evidence and circumstantial evidence differ.  Where do we go where we seek to have a difference between direct and circumstantial evidence?  Right, a magic show.  We know the woman was not sawed in half, the man did not catch a bullet in his mouth, the card did not disappear and reappear, the cell phone did not get broken in a blender or under a hammer then restored.  This apparent disagreement between director evidence (what we see) and what we know is accepted and fine - perhaps even very enjoyable to many, on stage and in the audience.  Why can not evolution and the Bible be the same?

One reads fiction - some enjoy Lord of the Rings, others learn Klingon, without thinking either are true.  Another useful, but untrue thing or area.

One you know is true, one is useful/entertaining to see.  As far as I know, no class asks for one to swear belief to evolution in an exam or lab.  My daughter has a similar concern.  She went so far as to write on the top of her quizzes and exams, “My answers here are according to what I have been taught.”

The Bible tells us that we walk by faith and not sight.   2 Corinthians 5:7b (ESV) we walk by faith, not by sight.  Faith is defined here:   Hebrews 11:1 (ESV) Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.  God leaves a gap in observations to allow room for faith, I do believe.  I believe the Bible is true and also believe the theory of evolution is useful.  They co-exist just fine for me and can for you too, I do believe.

Let’s go a bit farther.  What is life?  What makes one fly alive and another, perhaps with the same internal chemistry, dead?  How can we make a dead fly alive?  Evolution says nothing about what is life and how it started, nor can it now or ever relate back to the beginning.  The Bible does.  Moses transcription of God’s relation is accepted by Jews, Christians and Muslims.  It seems, at the very least, no matter how much concern an evolutionist has with the Bible, this is the only evidence of the beginning of life and a real scientist would have to take this evidence  and not logically reject the Bible and say, “We know nothing.”

It would be good if my thoughts, words and these passages of Scripture were of some help and insight to this question.",1,2025-06-20 03:52:35+00:00,MEDIUM,2.0,372.3017824074074,can evolution and christianity coexist

That doesn't mean each problem is totally separate, necessarily. Just smaller parts of a whole. Think of how in Lord of the Rings (classic epic fantasy), Frodo is solving the problem of the One Ring the whole way through. Generally, Aragorn and co are defeating armies and restoring order. Merry and Pippin tend to be building relationships diplomatically that help the others succeed (e.g. befriending Treebeard leads to Saruman's defeat), but they are party to several smaller conflicts within the larger one. 


This can involve several BBEGs, but keep in mind that antagonist characters are just agents representing a problem: the conflict isn't the mere existence of Joe the Vile, but the fact that Joe the Vile is leading a disinformation campaign to mire the people of the world in ignorance. The Problem is actually the battle between hard truth and easy lies, and fighting Joe the Vile is *how your characters solve it*. Or they can create their own information campaign to combat Joe the Vile's work -- they are both equally plausible solutions depending on how you approach the story.


Characters can also swap problems, succeed at solving a problem and move onto a new one, and so forth. If you don't have an ensemble cast, this gets trickier, but IMO it can be done, just takes more work to ensure the odds aren't too stacked against your protagonist and the threat level remains believable - things like allies taking action ""offstage"" can help here, as can narrative conceits like that of Deltora Quest where the hero is taking on a number of MacGuffin quests in a row, mostly apart from the main source of conflict until the very end.


So when it comes to plotting all that: try choosing a basic premise or world-state, and then come up with core problems going on there. In an ensemble cast, the problems can vary thematically; turn these into the core conflicts your protagonists are dealing with, and design protagonists that have A) a reason to tackle the problem (why them and not someone else?), and B) a reason they can't succeed immediately (what makes it hard for them?).


As you go, keep in mind how these characters are connected and some of the obstacles they might face in their journeys. Take time when inspiration strikes to outline from these conflicts.


For me the hardest part of outlining has always been pacing the main plot alongside subplots, and that's gotten better as i stop thinking of them as separate things and more like a shifting spotlight that highlights whichever thread of the story fits the needs of my narrative best at a given moment. With multiple ""main plots"" this is probably even more challenging, but I caution you against outlining ""Plot A"" in full before outlining ""Plot B"" because you may find opportunities for them to compliment one another thematically or in connected events if you go in order of the story timeline.",1,2026-01-24 12:36:53+00:00,LOW,2.0,183.99505787037037,What's your best way of plotting out an epic fantasy?

I find the crux is always about the conflict. The way I see it, the two biggest beats of your story (Inciting Incident and Climactic Moment) are dealing with a particular conflict question - the incident is *asking* a question, and the climactic moment is answering one. 

In my experience, getting a very specific and clear conflict question pays massive dividends down the line because basically everything else just grows naturally out of it. I find it easiest to phrase the question as a yes/no starting with ""will"":

-*Will Jason Bourne figure out who he is?*
-*Will Frodo get the ring safely out of the Shire?*

I find that stories most commonly have two major conflicts, and the one that forms the incident isn't usually the one that the climax answers. Some stories do a transitional thing where the initial conflict resolved around the midpoint as a new threat emerges. Some initial conflicts end up answered at the same time as a second conflict, sometimes the initial conflict ends up resolved after the final one (as part of tying up loose ends). Some stories genuinely do just have one conflict running from the incident to the climax though. 

As an example, in Jurassic Park the final conflict question is about whether they'll successfully escape the island, but that can't be the incident because we don't realise they even need to escape till the midpoint. The initial conflict is more to do with Alan Grant's personal ambition to fund the digsites. 

So the initial conflict often is just a way to get us to a point where we can up the stakes and introduce an even more exciting conflict. 

This isn't just for action films either. 

Devil Wears Prada (dramedy)
- Initial: *Will Andy Sachs survive at Runway long enough to get her resume?*
- Final: *Will Andy end up becoming everything she Initially despised?*

Godfather (tragic drama)
- Initial: *Will Michael sacrifice his values to avenge his father's assassination attempt?*
- Final: *Will Michael do what it takes to become the most powerful and ruthless crime boss in town?*

Once I've got my conflict question (or two), the rest is just filling in the blanks. 

I guess I should also add here that I'm not one of those people who proselytizes these paradigms as the only way to analyze stories or the best way.

Content by christians can be good. Lord of the Rings was written by a Catholic for example and these are great books and great movies.

Content about Christianity is mostly viewed as lacking because it is more often than not meant to preach how great Christianity is and not to tell an interesting or engaging story.

There are a few exceptions, for example I like the movie Prince of Egypt.
 
There are interesting stories to be told within christian mythology but you have to adapt them to a modern audience and not try to convert the viewers to your religion.

If you want to create content ask yourself:

- Would it be entertaining for people outside of my denomination?
- Is the story told in an interesting and engaging way?
- Is it meant to entertain, or to preach?",1,2025-06-30 10:37:40+00:00,LOW,1.0,318.04335648148145,Can Christians Make Anything Good?

I have never understood how anyone can look at a holy text and see anything other than a human construct. 

That is, the stories of the Bible seem so incredibly human and of their time. They seem no different to the stories and myths of any other culture. Obviously, I don't mean in the details (although there are more than a few stories borrowed from neighbouring cultures); I mean that the claims about the things that God can do are no more incredible than the stories of other pantheons.  

Want a creation myth? Check out Pangu who separated out the heavens and the earth. Origin of the Sun? Amaterasu has you covered. God helping out in battles? The Norse, the Greeks, the Hindi... and so on. 

At the end of the day, the Bible doesn't seem to be anything more than mere fables that were trying to, at best, explain the world around them or, at worst, coerce and control the masses. The Bible is no different in this way than the Epic of Gilgamesh, The Upanishads, The Iliad, The Qu'ran, the Dreamtime, Lord of the Rings, the Amazing Spiderman, etc.

When you look at how the Bible came to be, the centuries of stories and embellishments, the rewriting, the arguments over which books to include, the translations and interpretations, it does not look divinely inspired; it looks exactly like human culture doing what human culture does. 

All 'evidence' that I have ever seen that tries to demonstrate that the Bible is inspired could more easily be explained as stories that people tell each other. 

""But the Bible mentions real places."" Hell's Kitchen is a real place, but that doesn't make Daredevil real. 

""I can conceive of a perfect being..."" Let me stop you there because no, you can't. 

""God is real because the Bible says so, and the Bible is inspired by God so it must be true."" Tell me how that's not a circular argument made up by fallible humans. 

And for my final example of how mundane and banal the stories of the Bible really are, look to how the description of the Tabernacle gets at least four chapters (Exodus 25-28, maybe more, I stopped reading) but the treatment of slaves barely gets anything more than ""beating them is fine, but if you kill one you probably owe someone money"".

jungle = the jungle, mobility, duel power, ganking power and clear speed are some of the best attributes here. A champ can have all of them, or excell in just a couple of them (varied role, bruisers, tanks, mages, assassins, markemen and even supports can work here)

mid lane = the only short lane, its the non jungle lane that interacts the most with the entire team (jg/supp ganks, adc or top rotations, etc). Since its a short lane falling behind isn't as devastating as in top. The meta in this lane is to be able to impact the map while being strong (mages and assassins are predominant here, but marksmen, bruisers and tanks can show up too)

bot lane = another long lane, played primarily by marksmen since its the best scaling class and is usually accompanied by a support to help them scale safely to the late game. The role has little impact early on, but if a bot laner (mainly adcs) gets ahead, they will usually determine which team wins the most teamfights (95% of bot laners are adcs, 4% mages and 1% or less weird cheesy picks)

support = a supportive role, its main goals are ensuring that the bot laner scales, securing map vision and rotating to impact the map at key moments (if the adc is bad, supports tend to roam a lot to try to find success in other lanes). Mainly played by engage/disengage tanks, enchanters to scale and buff the teams' carries or mages to dominate the laning phase (all classes are played here too)

So yeah, usually...  
Top lane = Godzilla (usually a solo operating raid boss)  
Jungle = Predator (a guy stalking its prey that looks for opportunities to either kill unaware/unsafe laners or take objectives)

Like, don't get me wrong, I have respect for authors that make entire fantasy and sci-fi worlds with logically consistent and detailed explanations behind every question you might have.

It's just the first clear example of this technique I can think of) and FROM's various works resonate so well with the people it hits with. Its because you're allowed room to fill in the blanks with your imagination. When it comes to things that aren't explained and can never be truly answered without debate/mystery the stories feel more mythic.

Basically, a lot of modern audience members become so concerned with writers having answers for EVERYTHING in mind so that there are no ""plot holes"" that they forget that mystery is important to a fantasy world.

Really one of my favorite dark fantasy series, the portrayal of combat is very hard and grounded with a lot of strategizing. All of the main characters are extremely flawed with just enough “good” in them to make them likable. Magic is definitely more of a Tolkien system than a Brandon Sanderson one, magic is extremely powerful but also mysterious and scary as fuck.

The *main* main character is a renowned fighter and sort of barbarian, with an awful reputation for being ruthless and unstoppable, but his perspective is very introspective and he really hates fighting. A lot of getting lucky and just having good combat knowledge from surviving so many fights in a world where most warriors die young.

Another character is a crippled torturer who’s too maimed to ever actually fight, but his chapters are riveting because it’s all really well done political intrigue and espionage. He could be put into any Souls game and nobody would bat an eye.",4,2026-01-14 13:21:18+00:00,LOW,4.0,17.403159722222224,Book Recommendations?

Would that sentence be hyperbolic to say five year ago? I thought it would be, but somehow we failed to treat MAGA with the social stigma they deserved. We collectively got more upset at the performative nature of calling out those ideas than the ideas themselves so we stayed quiet to protect those relationships. I guess it’s making me think of how we interact online vs irl and maybe the solution is more communication with family/friends with different beliefs but recognizing a healthy line for your own sanity. Like hobbit banning any justification for the recent shooting in this sub, some arguments aren’t worth the energy. Ultimately it’s important to have a line and communicate that crossing it will have consequences. We don’t have much political power as individuals but culturally we decide which social and civic responsibilities to follow. People still MAGA need to be shunned at this point to demonstrate their beliefs are not conducive to American values in any way and thinking toward the future we need to make this clear through our behavior.

I think that not reading what others have written in a chosen genre, is a way to potentially introduce ""accidental"" plagiarism.  For many writers, reading the genre they write, is a way to specifically avoid plagiarism.  They won't accidentally write what someone else wrote, if they are aware of what was written ahead of time.  They can also write a variation on what was written before, on purpose, once they are aware of what not to copy.

If someone doesn't want to re-write The Hobbit, they should first read The Hobbit.  Reading The Hobbit will introduce a potential writer to the concept of writing a story from the point of view of an innocent, ignorant character who learns about the world at the same time as the reader.  It will show the writer what this concept looks like, and how it can be used to produce an engaging story.  It will show the fantasy writer a relatively unique spin on what form the Hero's Journey can take, from an author who has helped define and inspire the Fantasy genre.  The same can be said for Isaac Asimov in regards to Science Fiction.

However... you are correct in that an aspiring author should not LIMIT themselves to only reading in the genre they choose to write in.  The best writers have personal libraries full of all kinds of genres, both fiction and non-fiction.

EDIT:  Think about it this way.  If one doesn't read within the genre they choose to write in, how can they possibly know how others have pushed the boundaries of that genre?  Think of the popular advice ""Write what you know"".  If you don't read anything from the Fantasy genre, or watch movies from the Fantasy genre, how can you know anything about it to write within it?",2,2026-01-18 20:58:02+00:00,LOW,2.0,251.97319444444443,Trying to write without reading other books is like trying to make a movie without ever having watched one

I have read so many books that just follow the well known formula of Tolkien, that it gets boring. Many tropes have been done to death (e.g. the chosen orphan just to mention one thing!) and that is in my opinion the great problem that trad publishing has, they focus too much on ""what has worked before"" that they don't dare jumping into something completely new. 

Sometimes you create accidential plagirism because something you have read comes up in your mind and you think it's new and great but you are just remembering, thought admittedly I think it more a problem musicians have with melodies. 

Funny enough I enjoy contemporary thrillers, while writing historical fantasy. Does it make sense? Nope, but I feel it keeps my writing fresher and I fear that my writing and reading might mix up.

When I go back to writing sci fi, I can go back to reading historical fantasy etc.

That was at a friend's place, trying out the game. I think I only played for a couple of hours. I don't remember the stats, but I was probably using a bow. I'm not sure I even made it to Beregost.

My first character after I bought the game was an elf ranger. Pretty sure I had max dexterity and wielded a longbow, but that's all I recall. I definitely had Imoen, Minsc and Dynaheir in my party, but I don't remember for sure who the remaining two were. Possibly Yeslick and Quayle.

I picked ranger because I'd recently read Lord of the Rings. I picked elf because they were better with a bow (and also, in part, because of LOTR).

These days, I wouldn't really play a ranger anymore. Fighter/thief is strictly superior in every way I care about. And I don't even play a fighter/thief most of the time, because fighter/thief/mage is more flexible, with little real downside.

That said, class choice and main stats aside, I wouldn't say I optimize my character to the wazoo. I choose weapons based on what I think fits my character - you'll never see me wielding Crom Faeyr or the Flail of Ages. Swords, daggers and bows only.

One could certainly argue (I'm not taking this side but I can see an argument) that if you buy a book, or a copy of a paper from a scientific journal, that you may use it however you please. You have purchased a copy for your use, and it does not break an authors copyright to teach your child to read using a copy of The Dresden Files, nor does it break copyright to use a copy of The Lord of The Rings in a MFA program to teach aspiring writers how to do worldbuilding.

I don't particularly like that analogy as it applies to training LLMs but that's not really the point.

The point is the nvidia did NOT buy a copy of The Dresden Files or The Lord of The Rings. The authors and rightsholders were not compensated for the copies that were made of their work. Nvidia (and other LLM companies) have made copies of these works and are using them in a commercial venture, yet they did not pay.

You can have a great story, a solid script, and a rich world, but if there's no real characterization in the voice performance, it all falls flat. A strong voice performance matters just as much as cleverly-written dialogue.

A beautiful world inhabited by beings with no discernible voice has no identity. If the characters are boring, I won't bother with the rest of the movie, game, or show.

I think characters and characterization matter far more than most people give them credit for.

But I'm no expert. I found Lord of the Rings to be dry. It was a fine watch, but no one stood out enough at a character level to make me want to revisit it.

Or we get some crapy lazy attempt at a game and then they use that as justification for why there isn't more. 

Just look at Helldivers and how much fun so many players had with that game which is clearly a homage to Starship Troopers. Where were those games for the longest time? Then I think they released an actual starship troopers after the fact but even then didn't have as much care put into it or the people making it might not have been the biggest fans of the movie maybe? (Can't say for sure cause I have only seen like one article talking about the newest game and how they were having to copy some features that Helldivers was doing already).

Just look at the Bond franchise, we have seen a few great 007 games in the past but then they kinda dropped the ball with a few releases and then just stopped all together. 

Part of the problem is probably they had a company or two not really give much of an effort or something and so the last few were duds because there wasn't a lot of care put into them. Last great one in my opinion was Nightfire for Gamecube/PS2 (avoid PC version made by some other company). Clearly lots of care put into it. 

After that a handful of Bond games that just looked bad and after that they just stopped completely.

Meanwhile a programmer/developer was making a Goldeneye remake in unreal engine called Goldeneye 25 or something and was planning on releasing it FREE on said anniversary of the movie/n64 game. Basically the same game but updated visuals and possibly a few other extra bits. Like 80-90% of the way there (there are/were some videos on youtube showing work in progress) before they got a cease and desist letter from the owners of the Bond franchise MGM/amazon and had to stop. 

Cut to a few months later and they announce Goldeneye N64 is getting re-released for switch and xbox one but it's a crapy port of the original game. So clearly they didn't want some fan remake distract from another money making low effort port. Game comes out, but requires everyone to be paying for online subscription to nintendo or xbox to play. People complain about the quality, I bring up goldeneye source mod still free and active on steam in a few posts and get temp. banned from the Nintendo subreddit for a few days or so cause of nintendo fanboy mods who don't like nintendo not getting the attention.

Cut to while later and looks like the company behind the hitman franchise (the ones who do a horrible job of selling you the latest hitman game with all DLC included for so many years before changing things, as well as some crapy DRM) gets to make a 007 game that some people are excited about. 

How long has it been since we had a great 007 game? Like 20 years now?

Just like WB and the lord of the rings games, where are they? We had 2 pretty good ones with the middle-earth shadow games and then nothing.

I could keep going on and on mentioning others (like a whole post about Star Wars and how horrible Disney handled getting us new games in that universe).

The question that immediately springs to mind when people ask about this is: have you ever smoked a tobacco pipe? And I do wonder because, tbh, it's a fairly awful experience. You can see why people took up cigarettes with such great enthusiasm when then emerged in the 19th century. Firstly, it takes great skill to load and smoke a tobacco pipe ""properly"". An eternity of fiddling and tamping is involved and many pipe smokers will tell you that, eventually, this is the greater part of the pleasure of smoking pipes. The actual smoking: not so much. Get it wrong and you end up inhaling the smoke from about 2g of tobacco in one draw, inevitably causing retching and spluttering coughs. And they are a bugger to clean, so almost always, as our American cousins say, they ""taste like ass"". Like cigars, they smell wonderful (the pipes - the smokers of the pipes less so) but this disguises their less delightful actual flavour (both pipes and their smokers).

If you're going to smoke cannabis in a tobacco pipe, firstly, it's going to be much nicer in a long stem pipe: a churchwarden or ""Gandalf"". Secondly, get a clay pipe (or glass), partly because that pipe stem is plastic and people in this sub do bore on incessantly about the cancerous risks of plastic and smoking, and partly because it tastes and smokes better. I favour clay. Thirdly, you should reduce the bowl, as your question and others have suggested. There are a few ways of doing this. **If you aren't averse to metal in your pipe, a ""**[**basket screen**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tobacco-Stainless-Screens-Resistant-Washable/dp/B0CNGYHH5C)**"" is not a bad option**. Fourth, light it with matches (or the now fashionable ""hemp wick""), like proper pipe smoker: drawing a match flame down into the bowl ignites the dope and not the bowl (if wood pipe) and is cooler (temps and style), improving the smoke. Fifth: clean it with pipe cleaners after every smoke, while it is still warm, to ward off the aforementioned ""ass"" taste later.

Finally: try using a Sebsi or Medwakh instead. They are much better pipes for smoking weed (grind it up very fine) or hash.",184,2024-11-06 18:34:07+00:00,LOW,1.0,290.0300462962963,Convert a traditional tobacco pipe for smoking weed?

**Noor by Nnedi Okorafor** I ended up incredibly disappointed by this book. There was a lot of internalized ableism that went completely unchallenged and the plot ultimately took away a lot of AO's agency as a disabled person. The romance (if you can call it that) was awful (besides it adding literally nothing, if your male character has never even once considered a clitoris, how about we just fade to black so I can move on with my life). None of the female characters besides AO had any real personality or agency beyond being either good or bad mothers/girlfriends/sisters and domestic goddesses. Lastly, the plot reveal that &gt;!the wind turbines were taking advantage of the Red Eye while also making the winds worse!&lt; was straight up nonsense. That's not how wind turbines fucking work. I tend to give authors that people talk a lot about too many chances (Stephen King, T. Kingfisher, Becky Chambers...) but I've learned my lesson and I think Okorafor just isn't for me after hating two of her books. I remember thinking, ""this is the first book I'll replace on my bingo card if I have time,"" about Akata Witch, and now I'm thinking the same thing about this one. 

Reading

**The Bone Harp by Victoria Goddard** I'm so glad to be past the second part of the book. It should've been an interlude... the third part is reminding me of what I liked about the first, but for a second there, I was seriously considering DNFing because I hated the middle so much. I was reading like 2 sentences a day for a while there. But anyway, back to the good. I really like the way this book is doing Tamsin's emotional healing. The harp's personality is really interesting and this would've made such a perfect bingo book for the Bards Square from last year (or was it the year before? I have a very loose grasp on the passage of time). Despite my complaints about the second part, I do think I'll come out positive on the book at the end.

**The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien** Slow and dense, but good! No more thoughts on it yet.

**Natural Beauty by Ling Ling Huang** Me when the horror book makes me feel unhappy :( I am only about 15% in and that's a little too early to tell with this one, but this goop horror better be good. 

**De Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien** I'm trying repetitive listening for learning Dutch (don't ask why I'm learning Dutch, I simply can't control which language interests me and I do it for the love of the game), and using this book is great because it's probably one of the very few books I don't get tired of rereading. ""In een hol onder de grond woonde een hobbit,"" iconic. This does mean I'm doubling up on Middle Earth, but that's pretty on brand for me ngl.

Playing

**Graveyard Keeper** I only played a couple hours, but I was already finding it annoying. So much running around through empty space and a stupid number of crafting tables. 

**Strange Horticulture** I'm kind of annoyed that this said it was approved for Steam Deck because it is... not the best on the Deck. I mean the font was tiny and the button controls just didn't work at all? I had to either connect a mouse or use the screen as a touch screen. I've heard such good things about it and even better things about Strange Antiquities though, so I'll try on my PC.

Peter was born in West Germany and grew up in a South African town that still believes in Hitler. Cantor Fitzgerald lost so many people on 9/11. I think they realized isolationism is the key. Cantor’s chairman is our secretary of commerce. He quit cantor only a month ago and now his son is in charge.

Thiel directly own roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.

Just a couple weeks ago Blackrock (an American company) bought 43 ports in 23 countries that includes 2 of the 4 Panama Canal ports for $23 billion dollars.

Having Israel/Gaza/West Bank as sort of an embassy to the world with Peter Theil’s hooks in the UK because about a year and a half ago they got the contract to manage UK’s health system along with all the work Palantir is already doing for their intelligence agencies and army (links below), the UK is our link to the world. Greenland is the buffer zone with Panama Canal as the border to the south. Tariffs in the short term hurt the economy but long term would force manufacturing to increase within our borders.

c059ee0e-d98e-4712-877a-19869eb834b3,1jcgqck,Jewish,zacandahalf,"It’s a little more complex than that. A lot of it depends on the time period. Tolkien wasn’t deeply antisemitic, but his view of Jews as a whole wasn’t too different from that of the majority of Europeans during his time. It’s more of a product of the times and the culture he was in rather than a distinct characteristic he held. His view of Jews was the same as was held in most of Europe. Tolkien wasn’t viciously anti-Jew; he deplored the Nazis and their “race science” and he was angry with his German publisher when they inquired whether he was “Aryan.”

But at the same time, very obviously, the “bearded Dwarves,” of The Hobbit mirror “the Jew” as commonly portrayed in medieval art. Tolkien himself noted that the Dwarvish language was a Semitic one. The Dwarves were the first race of Middle Earth, but they were clearly inferior to the Elves and the humans who come after them. Tolkien felt that dwarves were “like Jews: at once native and alien in their habitations.” Another time however, he noted that “the Dwarves of course are quite obviously—couldn’t you say that in many ways they remind you of the Jews? Their words are Semitic, obviously, constructed to be Semitic. The hobbits are just rustic English people.”

According to Tolkien scholar John Rateliff, author of a two-volume “Hobbit” history published in 2007, Tolkien drew inspiration from Hebrew texts and Jewish history when developing the dwarves. As craftsmen exiled from a bountiful homeland, the dwarves spoke both the language of their adopted nations and – among themselves – a Hebrew-influenced tongue developed by Tolkien. Tolkien’s dwarves remember their traumatic past with mournful songs, most are assimilated and ambivalent about reclaiming Erebor, their lost country. 

This was all early in his work. The Lord of the Rings was written during and after World War II, when the world witnessed how mythologies were created and distorted by the Nazis, and **THEN** we got the character of Gimli, who is a stark contrast to Thorin. He was a hero. He valued nature for its beauty, not its worth in precious minerals. It was a juxtaposition from their previous portrayals. While we don’t know for sure, this shift might have come from a realization that the tying together of certain stereotypes about Jews in his depiction of the Dwarves drew on beliefs that could have horrifying consequences for real people.

They represent art (artisanry), not wealth. Tolkien believed that Dwarves were the ones who got how to relate luminously to art, having dragons in the opposite pole. This is why the Silmarillion is a book about the relation of the Noldor elves with the Silmaril gems who Fëanor had created.

In other words, he saw Dwarves as creators and dragons as hoarders. He was arguing in favour of creating beauty to the World and letting go.

The question about how to relate to art is a core question Tolkien asks himself in his books.

I am not denying that Tolkien probably did held many antisemitic beliefs before WW2, after which, get reconsidered. But I am talking about Dwarves role in the overall mythology.

I would argue that Tolkien considers Dwarves to be constantly misunderstood in Middle Earth. For example, he argues that Dwarves had no understanding of selling private property. Dwarves, in Tolkien's lore, believe ownership of a thing always belongs to the creator. And that it can't be sold but lent. The ownership returns to the creator once the buyer dies.

That happens to every race, and Tolkien goes out of his way to depict some of the people dealing with greed as otherwise being alright - for example, Thorin, who is *mostly* upset about Smaug killing his people and takes things a little too far, but realizes he screwed up and apologizes after the other dwarves call him out on his nonsense.

&gt; They are both creatures of the earth

The Golem literally resides in an attic and was created from the earth.  
Gollum resides deep within the earth. Not because it is his home and he fancies it but because he is mad, has murdered people, literally eaten babies and can no longer live among normal people.  

The Golem by comparison is like a vacuum cleaner and can only do what he is commanded.  
The complete opposite to Gollum.

By the way if we go that way we are all like the Golem, after all we live on the earth.

How is Gollum imperfect? He has been driven mad by the ring.

By the way, you and I are imperfect beings as well by that margin.  
Boy I hope they were chewed out for that comparison.

&gt; They both can become invisible; invisibility was a property of the Golem in some stories.

I love the quick add of ""in some stories"".  
By the way, Gollums invisibility has nothing to do with him, it's because of an item.  
Anyone who wields the item can become invisible.

So what were the parameter for the Golem  
""The Golem was called Josef and was known as Yossele. He was said to be able to make himself invisible and summon spirits from the dead.[20] Rabbi Loew deactivated the Golem on Friday evenings by removing the shem before the Sabbath (Saturday) began,[11] so as to let it rest on Sabbath.""

Yeah that sounds like Gollum alright.  
I was always captivated by him keeping Shabbat after he pulled a note out of his mouth.

My toaster is a Golem. It even keeps Shabbat.  
Is my toaster Gollum?

“In his commentary to the first phase of the history of The Hobbit, John Rateliff elaborates on this, remarking that a motif “already present by the time this first chapter of The Hobbit was completed would be the partial identification of the Dwarves, in Tolkien’s mind, with the Jewish people” (79). He points to the existence of a diaspora, in which the dwarves settled “in scattered enclaves amongst other folk, yet still preserving their own culture.” The warlike nature of Tolkien’s Dwarves is associated with his reading of certain books of the Bible.3 Their craftsmanship resembles that of the medieval Jewish artisans of the Iberian peninsula, while their interest in gold is associated with banking—for centuries, moneylending was one of the few occupations open to Jews. But, Rateliff notes, “to his credit, Tolkien has been selective in his borrowings, omitting the pervasive anti-Semitism of the real Middle Ages” (80).” https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/20/article/513824/pdf

I believe Tolkien himself said that the dwarf language is based on Semitic languages.

It was a ring. An enchanted ring that corrupted everything it touched.

Maybe you’re thinking of the dwarves, who are depicted as generally being pretty okay people. Dwarves aren’t the only people in Tolkien susceptible to gold-sickness; the Men of Laketown are equally liable, and the *whole point* is that hoarding wealth is bad, not that any one group of people is any better or worse about it than the others. Tolkien repeatedly makes the point that the Erebor dwarves and Laketown men lived in harmony and typically got along very well until Smaug showed up.

The dwarves just tend to have a lot of gold and gems because they do a lot of mining, but that’s just the Erebor dwarves - the Iron Hills dwarves are smiths, mostly, and make their money forging weapons and tools, while the Moria dwarves made weapons, armor, and jewelry. Moria, too, fell because the dwarves got greedy, but they aren’t the only ones; the human Kingdom of Arnor fell because ~~Satan~~ Sauron showed up and the kings of Arnor traded their souls for power.

&gt; 1-In the Bible (or in the version I have) in Genesis it appears that God made the age of man limited to 120 years, something that although it is not so exact, it is enough to be shocking that in an era where everyone died at a much younger age, they have guessed so well and so precisely the supposed age limit of the human being.

Strange that you say people are living longer now since Adam and Methuselah lived to over 900 years old according to the same book.

But, the 120 years was supposed to be the life of Moses.

&gt; 2-Cherubs, Seraphim, and Ophabin. I feel these beings are too Lovecraftian to be imagined (given that the vast majority of mythology is simply chimeras or animals with supernatural abilities), and I don't understand how they could have been logically imagined at that time.

I can't understand your point here. Of course they are imagined. Or, do you think they are real? How many do you know? Where is the scientific evidence that they exist?

&gt;  I've heard theories about alien sightings, but they seem too conspiratorial and theoretical to be logical.

I'm very confused. Do you believe in them or not?

&gt; 3-Jesus, Luke, Matthew, John, etc. I've read on this reddit that the apostles and those who wrote about Jesus' life can't be trusted, but they seem so detailed to me, and there were several people doing that, that I just don't know how to explain it.

We've got some pretty good detail on the lives of Gandalf and Aragorn too. Ditto for Luke and Anakin Skywalker.

People are good at created detailed fictional characters. Did you ever wonder why the details of his life were written so much later than the fabrication of the resurrection?

When fictional stories grow from real characters, they tend to start from regular people. Then the stories grow to include myths and miracles. The Jesus story started with the resurrection. Then they created a life for the alleged human.

Did he exist at all? Maybe. Maybe not. I doubt we'll ever know. I think his very existence should be treated as a probability.

&gt; Not to mention the writings of (non-Christian) people after Christ that confirm that the person existed, and I don't know how to explain the details of his miracles in a logical way.

Way after. Why was nothing written about him while he was alive?

&gt; Also, I understand that Islam can be discredited because its prophet has been criticized for having done bad things (things related to little girls, war, etc) but how do you discredit Jesus? Wasn't he such a good person that it seems true in some way?

Nope. [Jesus was a hatemonger and a warmonger.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g8j431/which_specific_parts_of_the_bible_do_most/lsyuw8u/) The Bible is mostly evil rather than good. And, [Jesus owns all Christians as slaves and condones slavery.](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Colossians%204%3A1)

&gt; Pascal's Wager. Given what I've said, the most logical thing would seem to be to simply leave it in doubt and say that I don't know whether God exists or not. But this (apart from disturbing me) makes me doubt it.

Which of the 45,000 sects of Christianity will you bet your immortal soul on? Why not Judaism and Islam? Why not Hinduism?

Oh boy, here we go. I deliberately chose the shorter copypasta because it looked like you *didn't* have this problem, but apparently it's necessary after all.

&gt;DIT: The man reason for the title and the use of the word ""problem"" is because I've been thinking about CS Lewis' Lunatic, Liar, or Lord.


Lewis' ""Trilemma"" is directed at a very specific class of people: Those who: 

1. Believe that Jesus Christ did undeniably exist as a recognizable historical figure; and 
2. Believe that the Gospels present a more-or-less accurate picture of his teachings; and
3. Believe that the **moral and philosophical** teachings presented therein are all extraordinarily good; and 
4. Are only unconvinced of the **supernatural** claims. 

That is to say, [it already smuggles 95% of its conclusion into its premises](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/begging-the-question.html). To someone who does not already accept ALL of these unlikely claims, it's a complete nonstarter.

**First**, [there is very little evidence that any of the characters depicted in the Gospels ever existed in the first place](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/historicaljesus). They may be very, very, very loosely based around one or more people who actually existed, but as there is no non-fictional record of the existence of any of those people, we can't really make confident statements about them as if they were historical figures, any more than we can for Hercules or Osiris or Gandalf the Grey. 

Lewis offers the options of ""Liar, Lunatic, and Lord"" and claims they are exhaustive, but to this list we must add the far more likely option of ""Legend"".

**Second**, this argument depends on acceptance of the Gospel's moral teachings as supremely good. Due to the hegemony which Christianity has had upon Western civilization for more than a thousand years, [many people pay *lip service* to this idea](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/17/the-what-youd-implicitly-heard-before-telling-thing/), but surprising few people *actually believe it*. If you were to show a civilized person an arbitrary biblical teaching, but present it as coming not from the Bible but [from some obscure Chinese emperor](http://orthoprax.blogspot.com/2006/11/joshua-vs-general-lin.html), odds are very good that this person will reject it as nonsensical, atrocious, or both.

I went into great detail [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1j6jlci/is_there_any_problem_in_my_position_that_jesus_on/mgp2iy4/) about how the Jesus character is NOT a good moral role model, and only a deeply ignorant or atrociously evil person would assert that he is.

**Third**, even granting the previous two extraordinary claims, there is a vast and wide gulf between ""This person's moral philosophy is generally unobjectionable"" and ""Therefore, EVERY factual claim this person has EVER made, no matter how ridiculous, must be true"". It relies on a combination of **arguments from authority** (""If you think his person is good, you must agree with everything he says! Do you really want to disagree with a good person?"") and on **emotional blackmail** (""If you *don't* agree with everything this person says, you must think he's *evil*! Do you really want to be a meanie who goes around calling people evil?"").

The world is *full* of people who are *basically* decent and *basically* functional but who nevertheless  believe *certain specific* crazy things. The apologist who makes this argument is trying to manipulate you into thinking that, if you're not prepared to call Jesus *completely* crazy or *completely* evil (even though, given the evidence presented in the previous section, either of those conclusions might be entirely reasonable), your only alternative is to accept him as *completely* accurate and *completely* good. This is of course ridiculous. 

You can love your six year old niece while disagreeing with her about the existence of Santa Claus. You can love your nutty uncle and believe that he's a generally nice guy without necessarily buying into his beliefs about flying saucers. 
If the nicest person in the world claims that the Earth is flat, and the meanest person in the world claims that the Earth is round, the personalities of the people making these claims will not alter the actual shape of the planet by a single inch. 

The barrier to accepting options which Lewis names ""Liar"" and ""Lunatic"" is *much* lower than he makes it out to be, and need not be so emotionally charged.

**Fourth**, this argument *[Proves Too Much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much)*. If one accepts it as viable with regards to Jesus, one must either call every other spiritual leader in the history of mankind a ""Liar"" or a ""Lunatic"" (despite their claims being supported by no less evidence than that which supports Jesus), or accept that each of their mutually-contradictory claims are *also* true. This is, of course, no problem to professional religious apologists who already engage is special pleading six times before breakfast. However, to the non-specifically ""spiritual"" woo-woo granola-eaters to whom this argument is addressed, the thought of having to explicitly reject every teaching of Buddha and Gandhi and Zoroaster and the Dalai Lama and John Lennon and L. Ron Hubbard will usually prove unacceptable... and rejecting Muhammad's teachings would also be ""Islamaphobic""!

**Fifth and finally**, the argument's very structure is invalid. When examined closely, it reduces to ""If everything Jesus said was good and true, then everything Jesus said was good and true."" This is not actually an argument at all, merely a tautology. That which is freely asserted can be freely dismissed.

C. S. Lewis was famously an atheist for much of his adult life, despite his friend J.R.R. Tolkien's best efforts. 

It was, according to Lewis, a beautiful autumn afternoon on his way to the train station to go home, when the breeze caught the leaves up in the light, and he realized that he believed. 

And he was pissed. He argued with himself all the way home on the train against the idea of God. But to no avail. God had shown up and he couldn't deny his belief.

Sometimes, churches close, and need to be sold. When that happened the Church mandates that the grounds be sold for ""Secular, but not profane purposes"". As an example when I was a kid a parish nearby closed and the community merged with ours. Their building was sold to a school that focuses on children with behavioral issues.

  
Thus when a Church is sold, it can become a school, a library, etc., but never a bar or strip club.

  
In the same vein, a concert featuring the music of LOTR and GoT is secular, but not profane. In fact, if it is being hosted in a Church, there's a good chance it's a benefit concert, and some of the proceeds will be donated to a good cause. At least, that's the practice near where I live: A church near me recently hosted a benefit concert of an Irish band who donated proceeds to an organization that helps house and aid Ukranian refugees.

91f50952-e4de-42e1-b38b-aa18a9bcff99,1ktinp7,Judaism,Matar_Kubileya,"OT1H, I actually quite like Tolkien's dwarves as a product of their time. Tolkien didn't actually originate the Jewish coded Dwarves trope--that would be Wagner--and while Wagner used it in a blatantly antisemitic way Tolkien actually at least tried to invert it.

OTOH, though, I actually think that the Jewish coding of the Elves, especially the Ñoldor, under the constraints of Tolkien's paternalistic supercessionism have tended to be overlooked thanks to the more obvious coding of the Dwarves. They're an earlier people whose purpose is to instruct Men in correct religion and ways of living, who transmit the holy tongue and tripartite ""scripture"" of Tolkien's universe, and who are exiled from their homeland for their own sin yet long for the promised return thanks to the mercy of the Eldar. Given how a Catholic of Tolkien's education,  disposition,  and generation would have read the Bible and conceived of Jewish and Christian history, they pretty neatly correspond to how he would have understood the spiritual and theological relationship of Judaism and Christianity. 

At the same time, however,  the fact that they are so constrained by the (pre-Vatican II) Catholic theology implicit especially in the broader Legendarium makes it more difficult,  I think, for Jews to reclaim them. I don't think it's impossible, but I think it involves a much greater willingness to read against the text than a lot of people are going to be interested in or comfortable with.",9,2025-05-23 15:56:44+00:00,LOW,7.0,337.5099421296296,"Fictional societies inspired by the Israelites in fantasy, what's your take?"

Tolkien is basically respectful and so even when he says something that could be construed as antisemitic (say from *The Hobbit* ""Dwarves are not heroes but rather . . .""), one can generally trust him to mean well.

Contrast that with Rowling, who has many buried resentments that end up coming out unintentionally in her writing.

c8d6c28c-92cc-4613-a2f9-a5f73774c6e0,1ktinp7,Judaism,arathorn3,"There is nothing supposed about Tolkien basing his dwarves partially on Jews. He flat our stated it in a BBC interview in 1971 and in a correspondence with with a fan and fellow writer can be found d in ""the letters of JRR Tolkien""  his estate published a book that is just letters he wrote starting when he was in college till then end of his life.

The dwarves of Middle Earth, the central characters of one of the most beloved books of all time, are indeed based on the Jews. This was confirmed by Tolkien himself in a 1971 interview on the BBC: “The dwarves of course are quite obviously, \[sic\] couldn’t you say that in many ways they remind you of the Jews?” he asked. “Their words are Semitic obviously, constructed to be Semitic.”

Similarly, in a letter to Naomi Hutchison  he stated , “I do think of the ‘Dwarves’ like Jews: at once native and alien in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue"" -Letter 176 in the Letters of JRR Tolkien. Dates December 8, 1955.

  
Tolkien depiction of Dwarves is mostly but not entirely based on positive attrinutes,.They are the 2nd most resilient to corruption  of the various races in his works, only behind hobbits. Gimli and others are shown as completely heroic characters though distrusting of others at times due to historical reasons.

  
Tolkien could be described as a.Philo-semite. When he learned that a German publisher was inquiring about his ethnic background he wrote a scathing letter where he stated that ithat he regretted  that he apparently had no ancestors from that ""gifted people"".

  
In the letter he wrote to his  English publisher allen and Unwin with the response to the German publisher he wrote.

  
 ""I must say the enclosed letter from Rütten &amp; Loening is a bit stiff. Do I suffer this impertinence because of the possession of a German name, or do their lunatic laws require a certificate of *arisch* origin from all persons of all countries?

Personally, I should be inclined to refuse to give any *Bestätigung* (although it happens that I can), and let a German translation go hang. In any case I should object strongly to any such declaration appearing in print. I do not regard the (probable) absence of all Jewish blood as necessarily honourable; and I have many Jewish friends, and should regret giving any colour to the notion that I subscribed to the wholly pernicious and unscientific race-doctrine.

You are primarily concerned, and I cannot jeopardize the chance of a German publication without your approval. So I submit two drafts of possible answers.""

  
 One of the drafts is the one referenced above while the other was a sanitized draft. We do not known which one was sent to the German publisher.

However it will not slow Palantir down.  They have been around over two decades and have been steadily hoarding data about all of us.

They do not rely solely on social media. They get their data from federal government agencies such as ICE, FBI, and CBP, as well as from state-level sources like the DMV. They also collect from court records, real estate filings, financial institutions, etc.  These are just the sources I know about.

If you are worried about your social media, keep in mind that the information about you does not come solely from your own accounts. It is also “enriched” using data from people you interact with, your devices, and the services you use.

I believe they also use information that becomes available from data breaches and password leaks. But I do not think they’re the only ones who do that. Cambridge Analytica also does.  

I do not believe it is possible to erase your digital footprints to the point that Palantir do not have your information.

Palantir already collect data.   They are not being paid to do something new.

Palantir is now the  biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.

Peter is also a major defense contractor for the UK intelligence community and army along with the major police forces in the UK. He branched out to their healthcare a few years ago with a contract to shift through all the data at NHS England which is done now so Kier announced that NHS England will be shutdown (not NHS). Peter through his company has full access to Norway’s government and civilian surveillance services. Peter/Palantir provides direct support for the IDF (Israel) in all their operations from Gaza to the West Bank to Iran.

Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.

Karp has condemned “woke” ways of thinking, calling woke a central risk to Palantir, that Palantir is a counter-example to companies he considers woke. Karp condemned pro-Palestine protests calling them an infection inside of our society, he remarked the peace activists are war activists and they should be sent to North Korea. Karp has said the west has a superior way of living and said he supports Palantir contract with ICE and using the software to enable separation of families.

The things that concern me: 

1. After peaking in co2 emissions this year or next, continued (glut driven) low oil prices will lift oil consumption.  This makes a slow, gently down-sloping plateau the most likely.  That is a huge problem given that it will likely be a decade or more before we drop below the level of adding 2-2.5 PPM/year to the atmosphere.

2. Meanwhile back in the ecosystem we continue to add stress to a shrinking cryosphere and a set of carbon sinks with ill defined points of failure.  

Hansen says:  Our reduction in aerosols (so2, etc.) via cleaner maritime fuels is the equivalent of adding 100 PPM of co2.  The other GHGs - also add another 100 PPM.  His calculations put us at 625 CO2(equivalent) - give or take a bit.  And his contention is that we are at an all time high of Earth Energy Imbalance.  

He is forecasting a warming rate of at least 0.36 PPM for the next decades.  And that means we enter Thermageddon (the portal is at 2C) sometime in the middle to late 2030s....

If this year - sans El Nino - is about as hot as last year, than I think it more likely than not that Hansen is right.

Economists are sounding the alarm on the detrimental impact of these tariffs on the American auto industry as it is so reliant on parts that are built in Canada. Prime Minister Trudeau, while announcing Canada's retaliatory tariffs, was remarking on how these tariffs could precipitate mass closures of auto factories across the U.S. Yet less internal combustion engine cars being manufactured and transitioning away from this unsustainable car-culture, a transportation system designed around car-dependency (or car hegemony), is exactly what is necessary and required!

Submission Statement:

Once upon a time, the YouTube channel **Our Changing Climate** was making videos about things of such whimsy as the eco-cinematography of *The Revenant* and *The Lord of the Rings*, and espousing the promising alternatives of minimalism and renewable energy.

These days, the titles of their videos are things like *How to End Capitalism*, *How the Rich REALLY Cause Climate Change*, *Why Palestine Must Be Free*, *Why Net Zero is a Scam*, *Why China Isn't the Problem*, *This is Code Red for the Planet*, *Why the United States is Killing the World*, *Why We Need a World Without Cars*, *Capitalism is Killing Us*, and, most directly relevant to this sub, a trilogy of videos called

1. *Is Collapse Coming For Us?*
2. *How to Prevent Collapse*

and, today's video, the answer / conclusion to the previous two:

3) *Have We Surrendered to Collapse?*

The trajectory of **Our Changing Climate** over its eight-year long existence mirrors the trajectory of the catastrophic predicament we find ourselves in as a global species.

This video explicitly addresses the topic of **overshoot**, and traces the path of how the world's nominally ""liberal democracies"" have been the most pernicious culprits, sponsors, and beneficiaries of the ecocidal regime of fossil capital.

I get it. I'd like Gandalf to be real. But just because we want something doesn’t mean it’s a solid foundation for understanding reality or making decisions. 

&gt; Why would God let us choose our own paths if he wants us to believe?

Nt just ""wants"". Allegedly punishes you for eternity if you don't. Now fortunately, there isn't a single shred of evidence these claims are actually true.


&gt;  Before the big bang theory, what was the universe? 

Is a gramatically completely correct sentence in English. But just because a question is grammatically correct doesn’t mean it’s meaningful or even answerable. “Before the Big Bang” is a classic example—time itself, as we understand it, began with the Big Bang, so asking “what was before” is a category error. It’s a reminder that logic and language have limits when grappling with deep scientific or philosophical concepts.

&gt; science claims that matter cannot be created nor destroyed, but that completely ruins the whole concept of The Big Band Theory. 

No, it really doesn't. The Big Bang theory doesn’t say matter just popped into existence from nowhere — that's what apologists like to spread around to make the theory sound absurd.

Rather, it describes the evolution of the universe from an extremely hot, dense state. Quantum physics, inflation theory, and concepts like energy-matter equivalence (E=mc²) provide naturalistic ways to explain how matter and energy evolved without violating conservation laws. It’s complex, but not contradictory. 


And besides that, there's plenty of naturalistic hypotheses that wouldn't violate that scientific principle. For example, some theories propose that the total energy of the universe might be zero—positive energy in matter balanced by negative gravitational energy—so the universe could arise without violating conservation laws. 

Others explore quantum fluctuations in a vacuum as the seed for the Big Bang. These naturalistic models respect conservation principles while explaining the universe’s origins. 

&gt; Where are the missing links if evolution exists?

Superman stories, for the longest time, were only ever designed to use women as props for these characters. If Superman is the the savior, he needs someone to save. And it was always a powerless woman. Sometimes children.

These poor misogynistic examples reinforce the trad masc concept that men are the real agency holders in our community and that women are not. 

There are some good examples, I think, both from men and women. Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings and Brienne of Tarth from Game of Thrones. Both use their convictions to drive their agency in a way that doesn't diminutize women. I'd say that Geralt of Rivia also counts, though I think it can seem like a bit more gray area here.

I quite like Geralt, often baiting other people's expectations of him being trad masc to use as a cover for his feelings for his daughter, friends and family. As a trad masc looking cishet feminist man, I sure feel that vibe as I grew up. Geralt has to navigate expressing his humanity in a world that wants to treat him as an unfeeling monster.

Focus on the characters and their motivations. The world will naturally reveal itself through things like who the characters are, what goals the characters have, what obstacles they face, and small background details you can put into description. You can even hide world building in the prose, for example by having characters make analogies that make sense within the world.

Of course, you need some exposition to make the plot work. You should try to find interesting ways to communicate this that is not an info dump. But you should generally be wary of exposition that doesn't have an obvious connection to information the characters need now for the story.

And, yes, every piece of writing advice has exceptions, so of course you can find examples like Tolkien that included many world building details that were only tangentially related to the main story of Lord of the Rings. But, (a) note that even Tolkien relegated a lot of his world building material to an appendix because he understood that at the end of the day the narrative would get bogged down with detail if he put everything in the main text, and (b) just be aware that Tolkien was a genius; there have been many people who thought they could do what he did, and were wrong.",2,2025-07-23 02:14:46+00:00,HIGH,6.0,205.8773611111111,opinions on exposition dumps

Read, Write, Rewrite. Read good writing from others. Write your own. Rewrite as only needed. That is it. 

Some would say I am foolish for never writing a first draft and trying to write a first draft as a final draft. But honestly trying to write something as a first draft and rough I believe is one of the most stupidest ideas that was always nonsensical to begin with. You write as if you're actually writing. Don't write eight this is going to be rough and not really written out. That never made sense. Yes you may need to edit. Yes it may actually become a first draft versus what happens next. But these formalized rules of first and second drafts and editing and even working with evil editors who are just insane is all nonsense created by different industry standards and writings formalized standards that don't matter. Look at the top of what I said. Read write and rewrite. Rewrite as you need to. Rewrite edit change things around fix it. If you plan something out that's okay. If you make out lines that's okay. If you don't that might be okay. Do what you need to do and figure out your writing without having to bind yourself to any stupid rule no matter what. Because it's going to come down to the actual final writing and the full story not just this idea of having multiple drafts which may even become unnecessary and definitely made prevent you from even writing a first draft that actually reads like any true draft of the book. Saying no there must be a first draft that is rough and disposable comes from a presumption that you are going to fail and have to be edited and have to be always wrong. Editors are washed up riders who've been broken down by the system to think that they're a failure and teach other people that they're failures. Do not get trapped in that you're going to fail and need to learn and improve and are always a failure as a writer it's not just something that the outside world teaches it's sadly a part of the mentality of the writing and publishing World itself. Find the answers on what you're supposed to write and how to know that you are correct in what you write. It is a struggle. I wish I had more answers for you but I need them for myself as well before I can answer for you. But between self-doubt and overconfidence and criticism there must be a way we all as writers can find to know that we are writing the correct thing and that we are able to understand what we're doing adjust and edit accordingly if needed and continue writing the story without being caught in nothing but confusion and self-destructive fear about whether or not we're right all the time. There has to be an answer. Calm down step back and keep looking for it so that you have not just a burst of overconfidence nor just a fear of failure but actually finding a conclusion by working through it to understand the right way to write itself. Good luck to you, friend. Otherwise look at the discussions about vision and storytelling and rewriting as needed.

Please, for the sake of all that is good and pure in this world, do not skip the prologues of the books you read! The author put that there for a reason, and if you respect the art of writing enough to be a member of a writers' forum, I would hope you respect the author enough to actually read the words they put on the page.

Books—especially novels—are not just collections of information. The purpose of reading creative writing is not just to absorb the facts contained within, but to experience the words as art. What separates good writers from great ones is the writer's ability to marry prose to information. Tolkien is not one of the greatest writers in the history of the English language because he told a story about a farmboy who destroyed a magical MacGuffin. I could describe the plot of *The Lord of the Rings* in a few sentences, but that would be no substitute for the real thing. The prologue, *Concerning Hobbits*, perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the narrative and, crucially for this conversation, works best as a prologue, set apart from the narrative, but informing the whole thing. When Sam and Frodo lament the possibility of never returning to the Shire, it affects the reader so deeply because we know so much about what Hobbit life should be. We long to return to the Shire and sit in a cozy hole in the ground, smoking our pipe and eating our afternoon cheese. By setting that information apart from the narrative, it is able to transcend the narrative and inform the whole thing. *Concerning Hobbits* cannot be renamed ""Chapter 1,"" because it serves a totally different purpose from a narrative chapter.

But not all prologues work like this - in fact, I can't remember the last prologue I read that functioned this way.

How do you feel about ""The Shadow of the Past"" from *The Lord of the Rings*?  Or ""The Council of Elrond""?  Are these natural types of exposition?

Are the prologues in The Wheel of Time series exposition dumps?  What about in A Song of Ice and Fire?  I'm just trying to find the line between what constitutes ""story proper"" and ""exposition"".

Some prologues start *in media res*, and the we cut away to see how the main character is going to be caught up in it all.  Is that an exposition dump?  Should it have been integrated into the main chapter?

Or am I just somehow selectively reading books with prologues that you wouldn't criticise?

&gt;the ideas i deem as “interesting.”

Ah, the arrogance of youth. Kid, you've gotta take your ego out back and give it a right old punch up the nostril.

I was like you at that age. I was narrowed down to action-mystery; works by Alistair MacLean, Robert Ludlum, or Arthur C. Doyle. I liked some of the shorter sci-fi, like the *I, Robot* stories by Isaac Asimov.

I tried writing an action mystery. It sucked.

When I was older a friend loaned me the first two books in Daivd Eddings' *Belgariad* series. Suddenly I was hooked on fantasy. But not that slow heavy fantasy, like *Lord of the Rings*, but the lightweight fluffy stuff.

In time, my reading choices grew. I took risks, not knowing if I was going to like something. Like you, I was often prejudiced against certain types of books. Then I read them, and discovered how amazing they were.

I know how easy it is to put up a wall when someone tells you to do something you don't want to do. I know how insanely difficult it is to pull that wall down.

I also know that it's worth it.

If you can overcome your current narrow interest, perhaps by looking at works that are adjacent to your own, you'll be able to grow as a writer and as a person. Sure, nothing's going to match your particular immediate interest. Well, so what? That's the point of reading outside your preferred genre. You get a broader view of things. You might, perhaps, even improve your own writing.

Tolkien’s The Hobbit probably has the worst prologue of any popular book ever written. It’s basically “listen here bitches, this is about hobbits. Deal with it. Got it? Cool. Oh what’s a hobbit? Glad you asked *ahem* first….” And it’s like six pages of info dump on mostly hobbits but also some other stuff I don’t remember because it was like 6 years ago and I skimmed it. I remember reading a lot of books like that but this one stood out for the sheer length and how defensive it felt. 

George R. R. Martin has a great prologue in Song of Ice and Fire. It sets up dramatic questions, introduces you to the #mainvillain that isn’t able to be introduced at any other point in the book, and gives you a feel for the writing and themes right away. It also does it in a POV that is only seen in the prologue which makes it feel like it should be separate and not just “chapter 1”. To Bleed A Crystal Bloom has a similar opening and it’s decent. 

People who skip prologues likely ran into bad ones when they first started reading and think they are all like that. My partner is a skipper and I use to be until Twilight (it was really short and technically a Preface not a prologue but the first sentence caught my attention. Say what you will about Twilight but at the very least the preface was masterfully done for its genre and target audience).

You can’t stop everyone from skipping but here are some tips to make it less likely to happen: keep it short as possible, have an intriguing first sentence, make sure it’s not an info dump and actually serves a purpose that can not be done more effectively elsewhere in the book. 

Keep in mind your book doesn’t *have to* have one. Ideally it shouldn’t be there because you have a weak opening (like Twilight). Many critically acclaimed books don’t have one at all like Handmaidens Tale, Earthlings, and Six of Crows. 

A prologue isn’t good or bad and don’t choose if you put one in your story based off of other people’s preferences. If it fits do it. If it doesn’t then don’t. You know your story best.

Now, the idea of reading that everyone recommends is it will help you grasp the concepts of formulas and tropes as well as  formatting. It's another tool. When you start to pick up on, say the hero journey formula. Famous stories that contain this one is the lord of the rings, Harry Potter, Eragon. understanding these formulas help us as writters. They are sort of a road map. Tropes are reoccuring plot devices. The chosen one being a popular in the heros journey. Basically anything you read from fantasy to sci-fi will contain combinations of these elements. But frankly just write what you want, start with short stories.

There was never anything wrong with the gameplay ever (/hj). The lore is my biggest influence, the way the lore is written is something I'm replicating in my book with biases in the exposition dialogues and conflicting versions of the same events, the setting has greatly influenced mine, and I drew sime ideas for my premise and story from the plot and lore of the game.

2. The Lord of the Rings. It's not really the setting that appeals to me, it's the sheer complexity of the lore and the very mythical aspect of it, which is another thing that I'm going for with my lore. It's also an incredibly deep body of work, with heavy philosophical themes that I just love. I am fairly sure that, if you detached yourself from the visuals of Peter Jackson's trilogy, you may very well imagine Middle Earth with a weird Fantasy visual identity and it would look good, because to me, it just scratches an itch that's very close to the one Gene Wolve scratches.

3. Sword and sandal films. It's controversial for good reason (i.e. some scenes are just p0rn, and it's because Penthouse funded the movie), but Caligula (1979) is my main visual inspiration for character designs and I love how grandiose it is, perfectly capturing the madness of the guy and how decadent the Roman aristocracy could be. Gladiator is also one of my favorite movies, I love everything about it aesthetically and Commodus is one of the few fictional villains (yeah, he has nothing to do with the historical Commodus) that actually frighten me.",2,2025-07-11 05:57:19+00:00,LOW,1.0,13.190462962962963,Let’s Share: What Are Your Creative Foundations?

No one here is saying that writing advice/rules given to beginners is a formula. No one is promoting a formula for a best seller. Following the show don't tell rule won't automatically make a story good or a writer great. A story doesn't work like a piece of furniture from IKEA. It is art. Art is subjective, yes. But that doesn't mean there is no technical skill involved that makes it better. 

Grammar is full of rules. This is what makes language make sense. If you notice, I don't follow all of those. Why? Because I have my own style of writing and take liberties with the accepted usage. But I KNOW the rules. 

No one should ever say that you absolutely must follow every piece of writing advice to the T with no exceptions. That would be ridiculous. Don't listen to those people. 

As far as advice available, I'm not talking about youtubers, I'm talking about professionals. 15 years ago I was at convention panels listening to authors, editors, and agents giving the same advice I still hear today. It is good advice and no, it wasn't a writing convention. 

On your note of historic writing. Yes, they did not have these rules, in fact they likely had very different ones.  Because the way people consume literature has changed over the years, and so has the english language and its use. Readers in older times were accustomed to a different kind of storytelling and had different expectations. As did the writers of that time, and I would bet that their interpretation of good literature was based on a lot of rules.

Contemporary fantasy audiences don't typically gravitate to works written in the style of Tolkien. That doesn't mean he wasn't great. That doesn't mean people don't still enjoy his work. It means that readers of this time are not looking for ten pages on Hobbit culture and pipeweed before the story actually starts.

Baldur's Gate came on five, or six including Tales of the Sword Coast, disks.

If you ever actually installed the game, you'd know there is an option to install the FULL version of the game (a staggering 2,5GB!) which means you didn't have to swap out disks during play, but keep Disk 1 in the drive. Someone who played the game would know this option exists!

In the original BG, you had 16 inventory slots + 3 slots for arrows on character. That means you can carry 20*19 = 380 arrows assuming your inventory is full with just them (plus up to four weapons, shield, armour, cloak, 2 potions, etc.

Now, wouldn't someone who is so adamant about how the game works, know that and not say you can only carry 220 arrows? That comes out to 11 total slots for arrows: 3 in arrow slots and only 8 in inventory? I am fairly sure the game had more inventory slots :D

Back in the olden days, working around mechanics like having to manage supplies, was actually considered _fun_. Now, that doesn't mean that all of you EE people are wrong for having the increased stack sizes in EE, by all means, have fun with it. 

But what Leo is describing at the literal Satan of gaming here, was actually kinda, sorta, part of the game fun. You DID indeed have to budget space for arrows, and one character often would only be carrying arrows, and slowly free up space for loot as the party shot the supply out. But yes, we DID have to budget arrows for going into say, Nashkel Mines, cuz that was a LOOOOOONG trips and you needed a lot of arrows!

Kiting was also never the solution for TIME SAVING (*yugh*, who the hell games with this in mind), but most often a solution to deal with high damage enemies early game and sometimes late game. The number one advice on a forum known as PlanetBaldursGate (know that forum, Leo? You should if you're such a BG player and strategist) for new people was, in fact, to KITE. Tactic is as old as the game.

Why? Because 'taking your chances in melee', even with a party of four or six, against even one or two wolves early game, meant simple death for at least one character (and wizards on average had 2/4 HP, sometimes even 1!!!!). But then again, someone who played the game would know.

I'd like to point out Leo disagrees with the written D&amp;D definition for THAC0 as well, showing that the truth is less important than their opinion:

https://old.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/1ohwqr2/starting_baldurs_gate_i_any_words_of_advice/nltbawj/

How can you, reader, trust a person that doesn't know the most confusing mechanic of 1998? The old gamers here have it burned into their brain cuz it's so goddamn confusing. Leo's arguing with people over the book-definition!

Calling people retards and morons for asking basic questions two weeks ago isn't helping Leo's case considering the above:

https://old.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/1ohwqr2/starting_baldurs_gate_i_any_words_of_advice/nltawbe/

&gt; Well, in this case (like in many others) new players are being rude and react like morons to the simple suggestion to ""play the game like it was made in 90's, not by watching youtube guide""

The fact that Leo is hating on the single most common resolution at the time, 640x480, while in the same breath mentioning AoE2 which was more zoomed in and involved managing armies of 20x the size of BG, is evidence that this person is pulling any info from mid-air to try and seem smart. Nobody would complain about the small resolution at the time: that was THE resolution for most, and we were happy we had it! Just three years earlier 320x240 was more common!

Last but not least, Leo contradicts himself:

https://old.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/1ohwqr2/starting_baldurs_gate_i_any_words_of_advice/nlr8ygz/

&gt; the game can be cheesed by using short bow kiting and a few first-level spells. Figuring out winning strategies and best party is like 70% of the fun from playing BG1 and IWD1.

Not only is their entire fun just finding ways to cheese and minmax games, Leo just outright says that the entire game can be kited. Which is true and why it was done a lot.

I.e. Leo contradicts themselves, not to mention the way this is done.

If God is imagined as a force that prevents suffering, then the world absolutely looks like proof that God isn’t real. But if God is understood as love itself—not control, not power—then hatred and cruelty don’t disprove God. They show what the world looks like when love isn’t chosen.

Love doesn’t override human freedom. It shows up through people, often quietly, often at great cost. That’s why stories like *Lord of the Rings* resonate so deeply. Tolkien had seen extreme brutality in war, and what stayed with him wasn’t that goodness was fake—it was that power corrupts, but love, courage, and loyalty still matter, even when they don’t “win” in obvious ways.

In that sense, God doesn’t disappear in dark times. God becomes harder to see because love becomes harder to live. But every act of compassion, every refusal to dehumanize, is still an expression of something real.

You don’t have to call that God. But the fact that love still exists at all—even now—suggests that darkness isn’t the final truth of the world.

He’s always courageous, he’s always willing to help out even for people he’s just met in passing (well I suppose you the player could play him selfishly and ignore every side quests, but that’s not the intent) and he only seeks power for the cause of helping others which in turn leads to various divine/sacred entities being willing to give him power - most notably of which is being the one who can draw the Master Sword.

The main problem is that it would take way too long to play a bunch of Zelda games while also reading a bunch of Tolkien books.

Also definitely depends on what you’re reading. Is it just LotR? Does it include the Hobbit, or the Silmarillion, or the Children of Hurin or Fall of Gondolin or something else?

LotR
- Ocarina of Time captures the feeling of Aragorn’s responsibility to be the hero and the fight against the Dark Lord.

The Hobbit
- Minish Cap! Compliments the scene of Hobbitton and the love of small things, and the sense of exploration at the beginning. It’s a light, wholesome adventure.

Couldn't we also explore the rest of the film 

Like you go into a mode where you go outside of the official camera view and explore the setting in a free flying camera 

Even better is with a simple prompt you can add in characters/vehicles/entities from other franchises lets say we add a Halo 3 Scarab Tank into the battle of pelenor fields from Lord of the rings. Also say in the prompt the characters/vehicles all behave in the same matter from wherever the source material is. This type of crossovers or experiences is what I am personally excited for.

Better yet I turn it into a videogame and you can play as 1 of the gondorian guards or a brute in the scarab tank. The controls are like a fusion of halo and 3rd person hack and slash. 

So basically you can could explore the world, make changes into the world that affect the story like an rpg game but way more fluid, you can go into the world and interact with it like a videogame.

The possibilities and potential with this tech is endless!

Their current P/E (Price-to-Earnings) ratio is currently 540.

For context, AMZN's P/E ratio was 1000+ in December of 2022. Look what happened after.

Tuesday, I find out one of my richest, always-ahead-of-the-game, smartest, most well-connected friend (who haven't spoken to in a few years) works for... Palantir.

It has not done a *single* stock split since its IPO in October of 2020 @ $9.20.

Currently sitting around $132 as of July 2, 2025

Also, the current 6 month chart literally *confirms* a cup and handle pattern (specifically, between Feb 14 and May 14/18 of this year when PLTR broke thru it's previous resistance of $125.00).

And it's definitely not too late to get in. Look at current Market Caps of these 2 tech companies:

Palantir (PLTR) - $312.27 Billion. (IPO'd 2020)

Apple (AAPL) - $3.17 Trillion (IPO'd 1980).

Both companies have Government contracts, in different agencies.

The key difference between the two: 

-Apple has publically stated they do NOT give backdoor/master-key access to government agencies in order to *protect* consumer privacy.

-Palantir landed a major CIA contract in 2025. Trump is [implementing their technology](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html) across multiple agencies.

I see no reason why PLTR can't reach or exceed these market cap levels in the next 10-15 years.

I stopped playing WoW in Burning Crusade. I was young, going to college, and thinking that videogames would distract me from whatever future I was trying to create for myself. My favorite part about BC was Illidan. A renegade Night Elf trying to save the world turned bad guy. Then, I met that sentinel that IIRC starts the attunement quest for the Black Temple. It took me this long in WoW, but that's when I liked the story.

I was not prepared, and life happened. I'm out of college, in the workforce, have time available for hobbies, and Legion comes out. Illidan is returning AND we get to play as a Demon Hunter? COUNT ME IN! My return to WoW was weird. So much had changed. I logged into my old main and had mail saved from a crush I met in WoW. I logged into my alts and could remember all the things I was last doing with my favorite ones. I didn't even play WoW for long before, but logging back in for me was both sad, and it filled a void I didn't know was missing.

The sentiment, emotions, feelings, whatever you want to call it got the best of me. I needed to start over with a new character. One I hadn't played before, but what should I pick? I love Night Elves, so I was looking over the classes they could be, and I remembered the feelings I had when my IRL best friend back during BC days told me he didn't like WoW and stopped playing. Him and I are still friends, but by this time I felt so distant from him.

He was working on creating his dream, and I didn't want to bother him with what I thought were my nightmares, so I made his character. His Hunter was a Night Elf. All of my character names started with Ara because I was obsessed with Aragorn in LOTR when I was younger, so I made a Night Elf Hunter with a name starting with Ara and ending with the last four characters of what he named his Hunter. My friend's first pet was named after his dog, so my first pet was named after the dog I had for 17 years of my life. My second pet? I named after his dog which at this point had passed away. Loved that dog like my own.

Every pet I continued to get I was naming after the animals in my life that I loved, but I started running out of names, and for some reason I had logged into my old main and read the letters from my teenage crush that I had saved all this time in my bank. It was stupid stuff, but it reminded me of young, naive love, and a time of my life where I was ambitious, careless, and outgoing, so what did I do? I named my next pet after the Hunter that this girl mained back in Burning Crusade, and then I reached out to her IRL to get a life update and see if she was interested and able to play WoW again, so

TL;DR: My Hunter character is entirely a tribute to the pets, people, and game I love most.

Sometimes if I read something I liked I see if there's more on the same topic but I find that it's not a very productive way to try to get more of what I enjoy. For example i really liked Tolkien's silmarillion, so I tried to look for more books about elves or fantasy histories. None of them do it for me, because what I really liked was (a) his writing and (b) the merging of historical and mythological style, and (c) the batshit insanity but also pathos, breadth and depth that is Feanor, Fingolfin, and their children.

There's no way to categorize books to be able to satisfy those itches. The only way to know what I enjoy is to read a book and see if it contains it.

In the end, I want to read something that challenges me, expands my horizons, teaches me something new, triggers new interests, or is just entertaining.

&gt;(psssst this is the part where you prove me wrong by recommend books that fit my criteria)

I don't think helping you find a book that fits your hyper-specific requirements is a good use of my time. I think your whole approach is what's holding you back, and with this kind of thought process, you might as well continue to focus on fanfic.

This is why I said to read books in a variety of genres, from a variety of cultures and time periods.

Of course I don’t expect fanfics to be professional-grade or written like Stephen King, Tolkien, or Martin. That’s an unrealistic bar, and honestly not the point of fanfic. But at the same time, if you’re putting a story out there, I think it’s reasonable to hope for decent grammar, having coherent plot progression and meaningful character development that feels organic, as well as fewer interruptions like constant author’s notes mid-scene - anything that showed that the writer actually care about what they wrote.

Fanfiction doesn’t need to be perfect or polished like published work, but it also shouldn’t feel completely unfinished or careless either.",72,2026-01-17 12:17:39+00:00,LOW,1.0,13.991875,What are some of your unpopular fanfiction opinions?
6758eb10-4a15-406f-af6b-725391f7375c,1qen5d0,FanFiction,Autumn_Lleaves,"Any change to the canon events/characterisations, as it has already been noted in the comments, should have a reason.

But there’s also the other side of the coin: many fanfics stick to the “stations of the canon”/“canon rails” more than they ought to. For example, there’s a massive A Song of Ice and Fire AU where the divergence happened 300 years prior to canon events… and yet, barring a few cosmetic changes in names and titles, many of the characters are all the same and recognisable and occupy the same positions.

SI/isekai fanfics are especially prone to that. I remember, even back in 2010 when I myself was very much a beginner author, I was baffled when I read a fanfic for Burton’s Alice in Wonderland where a modern-day girl and her little sister fell into the rabbit hole instead of 19th-century Alice… and yet the plot went on almost EXACTLY like in canon. 

An author I know on a Russian fanfic site has done sporkings of a whole handful of Hobbit fanfics (for the movie) with SI or crossover heroines accompanying Bilbo and the dwarves — and all of them also follow the movie’s formula (except for usually saving Thorin in the end to hook up with the heroine). In one glaring case, Hermione Granger was written as going with the heroes, and still she didn’t do basically any magic and only served to be married off to Thorin in the end. 

TL;DR While one shouldn’t deviate from canon without reason, one should also remember that significant changes inevitably lead to deviation and not struggle to follow the canon formula. ",3,2026-01-16 18:52:18+00:00,LOW,1.0,13.833310185185185,How do you prefer fanfics to adhere to canon?

Back in the day there were so many Harry Potter fanfics that changed Harry's name to like Harold or Harrison or sometimes something completely random. Nowadays I normally see it in modern AU's. Sometimes I feel like I need to have a key to read those stories. 
I also prefer when characters keep their cannon name for a gender swap fic, although I am much more understanding/forgiving if the author just changes the last letter, like The Hobbit Bilbo to Bilba (definitely prefer just sticking with Bilbo tho). 


I love reading AU's! I do prefer the characterization to be at least somewhat faithful to cannon (Like I just can't read Teen Wolf pack mom Stiles because it's almost always so OOC). If I couldn't believe the character would act that way in 1 million years and it's a character I like it'd have to otherwise be a truly amazing fic for me to finish it. ",1,2026-01-17 00:20:44+00:00,LOW,1.0,6.849976851851852,How do you prefer fanfics to adhere to canon?

Just wanted to throw in my two pieces and say that the closest in this list to ""LoTR before LoTR"" are probably the Mabinogion Tetralogy by Evangeline Walton and The Once and Future King by T. H. White so I would recommend most people start with them.

Dunsany's work is amazing and his influence on Tolkien is clear but his prose is absolutely not for everyone, it's not a pleasurable read if that style is not your thing.

I absolutely love Conan, it's among the best fantasy that is pre LoTR but it is mostly disjointed short stories so it doesn't have the sprawling epic feel, Sword and Sorcery is much more self contained. Absolutely worth reading though.

The same sort of goes for the John Carter novels, the first three or four are excellent and do tell a somewhat continuous story but it's more a case of sequels rather than a single long continuous narrative. Also, Burroughs other famous work, Tarzan, is also worth reading.

The Broken Sword is probably my favourite of this list and is absolutely worth reading. It's incredibly short and was published in 1954, the same year as Fellowship of the Ring and shares many influences with LoTR, very fast paced and as other have said, essentially *the* proto-grimdark novel.",30,2026-01-25 07:17:07+00:00,LOW,3.0,202.58414351851852,"What is the most ""epic"" fantasy pre-Tolkien?"

08d98966-9410-4522-9354-e1d1960486cf,1qlpomx,Fantasy,PatrickCharles,"The problem with this take is that Middle-earth is actually quite dynamic. See the North, for example. Arnor didn't remain an unified kingdom. It shattered into three different realms, which then went to war with each other, which then fell, which then were more or less forgotten... And their borders kept changing, to the point that there are now Barrows of long-dead Kings of Men basically on the doorstep on the Shire. The Hobbits themselves were given the Shire by one of the Kings of Arthedain. When Aragorm is crowned King of Arnor, it's not the equivalent of someone becoming king of France of the UK today. It's the equivalent of the Carolingian Empire coming back. It's *old*, and while there is a traceable link to the present, just like you can trace both France and Germany and everything in-between them to the Carolingians, it's not a 1:1 correspondence. 

In a similar way, Rohan is quite recent. In the old days, the Rohirrim, or rather, the Eorlingas, lived in the far *North*, which is why their language has a word for Hobbits, whereas the Gondorians don't.

A lot of the dynamism of Middle-earth is kept hidden due to the artifice of translation, that Tolkien used, and by the fact that a lot of it is in the appendices, instead of bogging the narrative down. But much like everything else, the static-ness of Tolkien's imitators is based on their flawed reading of him, not on the man himself.

(there's also the element of living memory. Middle-earth is full of people that literally saw the events of 3000+ years ago and those people actively educate and guide the younger leaders. That has an impact. If we had people that had been alive since the days of the Assyrians in charge of world leaders, you can bet there would be way more continuity in our world as well.

30d91f91-bc17-4695-b402-6370f56100c8,1qlpomx,Fantasy,how_to_namegenerator,"Tolkiens world is still far more static than the real world though. Gondor stands throughout the entire third age, meaning it lasted at least well over 3000 years, which is almost unheard of for any state in the real world, and whenever it has happened that state is pretty much unrecognisable after all that time (difference between the Roman kingdom and the Byzantine empire at its end for example, and that was only around 2500 years). Arnor, which you used as an example of how dynamic Tolkiens world is (which is fair when compared to a lot of other fantasy) still lasted about a thousand years before splitting in three, and the last of those successor states also lasted another thousand years after that, which means the longevity of Arnor is far superior to the vast, vast majority of real-world states and empires. 

In terms of language change, Tolkien is mostly decently realistic, since most instances of languages changing less than you’d expect over thousands of years are with the elven languages, where that makes sense due to immortality (though it is strange that the different descendant languages of Primitive Quendian diverge relatively quickly into Quenya (with notably distinct Telerin, Ñoldorin and Vanyarin dialects) Sindarin, Nandorin and various Avarin tongues in the first age, but the different Sindarin dialects of the elven realms of the second and third ages (Lindon, Lórien, Mirkwood, Eregion/Rivendell, etc.) don’t seem to diverge pretty much at all for 6000 years) or with the dwarven Khuzdul, which we first of know next to nothing about, so it might have changed, and secondly is implied to maybe be kind of woven into the dwarves as beings, and thus wouldn’t change at all. The major exception is in the third age, where Westron doesn’t seem to change or diverge for 3000 years. Arnor and Gondor had very little contact for thousands of years, but their language didn’t diverge. Even after the fall of Arnor, the spoken vernacular in the Shire and Bree barely diverged from, and remained mutually intelligible with, Westron in Gondor, despite Arnors final successor state Arthedain falling a millennia prior, and Arnor and Gondor being in little contact for 2000 years prior to that. Basically, even if we say that the longer lifespan of the Dúnedain (and to a lesser extent Hobbits) halves the rate of language change,  Shire-speech and Gondorian Westron should still realistically be about as distinct as the different Romance languages are from one another. 

All that said, I largely agree that Tolkien has a more dynamic world than most people acknowledge, and more dynamic than most other fantasy worlds that are inspired by him. The idea that all of the Seven Kingdoms speak the Common Tongue in ASOIAF is completely ludicrous for example. In the real world I’d expect a country like the Reach alone to have like a dozen mutually unintelligible language varieties in a medieval setting where travel and communication is limited, and where the system of government is feudal (take language variety in France before the revolution, or Spain before the  modern age, or Italy or Germany before unification, or all of those to a limited degree even today, as examples). It’s also completely ridiculous to think that more than a small handful of noble houses would have survived for over a thousand years, let alone most of them being many thousands of years old, and that only gets more unbelievable when you consider that they’re mostly still ruling the same land as when they were founded, whereas in the real world noble houses tend to bounce all over the place, especially if women can inherit and house affiliation is counted through the male line, which is exactly how it works in Westeros. By the way, how come after thousands of years, the commoners of Westeros still don’t have last names that they would inherit by being distant descendants of younger sons of noble houses? Like, the descendants of younger sons have to go somewhere, and after a few generations there’d be so many that they would have to end up marrying into the small folk and be considered small folk themselves, and if they’re not refused the right to maintain they’re last names, you’d expect most small folk to have last names of noble origin after a couple hundred years, let alone 8000 or so. Sure, there are ways for this to be explained away (like a branch of a noble house which doesn’t own land losing the right to use the family name after 3-4 generations or something), but no such explanation is given. 

Sorry for the rambling. My point is, while Tolkiens world is more dynamic than most people think, and more dynamic than a lot of other fantasy worlds, it’s still quite static compared to the real world, especially in the second and third ages.",3,2026-01-24 22:43:29+00:00,LOW,3.0,8.384629629629629,Why do so many fantasy worlds forget how old things should feel

I mean, he did literally start the Legendarium as a conlanging playground after all. That said, I feel there’s a slight, but noticeable difference between the level of realism of the linguistics of the first age (which was the one he developed for decades and which was designed to be a world first, and setting for stories second) and the realism of linguistics in the second and third ages (which were the ones he crafted to be backstory and a setting for the Hobbit and Lotr). Basically, I think realism of linguistic history took a slight backseat in the second and third ages so that the hobbits would be able to speak to the people they meet without too much difficulty, and so that Tolkien didn’t have to spend a couple decades extra making like five distinct daughter languages of Sindarin just because 6000 years have passed and by the rate of elvish language shift he established in the first age Sindarin should thus have realistically changed significantly, and diverged in Lindon, Lórien and Mirkwood.

Realistically, even someone who ""keeps up"" with the changes of a language (which is unlikely to be the case for *every* multi-century-old character we encounter without seeing substantial changes in speech style) might understand someone's slang and sentence construction much better than they can adjust to using it themselves. Also, historically, people living as far away as Gondor and the Shire frequently did speak very different dialects, even when using trade languages to bridge the gap. Look at the territory of modern France, which had hundreds of regional dialects in the middle ages, which were often not mutually intelligible. Most likely, Tolkein just wasn't interested in reflecting these realities, just like he glossed over or handwaved other types of detail that weren't relevant to the story. ",2,2026-01-24 21:03:45+00:00,LOW,2.0,207.60175925925927,Why do so many fantasy worlds forget how old things should feel

For Aragorn - it does totally make sense that someone in 1400 AD would claim they are the descendent of the last Emperor of Rome, that's pretty consistent with what was going on at the time. But for the world to still be pretty much as it was when the Roman Empire collapsed seems like a stretch - you need to invoke magic for it to really be sensible, with Eriador essentially being cursed in its defeat by the Witch King, never to be truly settled again until the Return of the King.

It culminated in a weird sight at lunchtime, with it raining fairly heavily on one side our work canteen, but completely dry on the other.

Reading wise, I've started getting in to the habit of reading one or two contemporary short stories a day, as I do really like short fiction but read very little from the speculative literary magazines last year. I've read all of the current issue of **Weird Horror #11**, with my highlight being *[We Didn't Used to Be Like This](https://www.weirdhorrormagazine.com/we-didnt-used-to-be-like-this)* by Jack Klausner, an arguably non-speculative horror story about how people change over time. I'm also making an effort to track my short fiction reading, particularly their themes.

I recently finished a re-read of *The Two Towers*. I never got round to reading the wider Tolkien legendarium outside of LotR, The Hobbit and Silmarillion, and rectifying that is one of my goals for the year. I also finished *Odyssey*, the final entry in Stephen Fry's series on Greek mythology, and *Walking Practice* by Dolki Min, which feels like a queer Left Hand of Darkness set in a modern Korean city, told from the point of view of an unrepentant version of the monster from *Someone to Build a Nest In*. It's delightfully messy, dark and funny, and has a great audiobook.

Currently, I'm reading *The Artist* by Lucy Steeds, which one last year's Waterstones Debut Fiction prize and their Book of the Year. So far, it's brilliantly tense with great characters. I'm also going to be starting the audiobook for *Murder on the Orient Express* narrated by David Suchet, as I have somehow got to my 30s without reading any Agatha Christie.

0f3214ac-7ae0-4ed2-b291-0f3868bc7b1a,1qka3nq,Fantasy,RedditOfUnusualSize,"Yeah, to look at it from a purely marketing perspective, B.Dalton and Waldenbooks more or less invented the fantasy genre in the 1970s and 80s, because they noted that a) *The Lord of the Rings* persistently sold very well, but b) didn't really seem like it was attached to a genre, at least not in the same way that, say, *The Martian Chronicles* and *Foundation* were visibly, recognizably in the same genre as *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* or *War of the Worlds*. They had the bright idea to create a genre around it, on the assumption (correct, it turned out) that *The Lord of the Rings* was the forebear of an as-yet untapped market.

The result was basically a lot of books that fused *Dune*'s hero's journey, except done completely uncritically where Herbert was deeply skeptical of whether one person's self-actualization-through-vengeance could coincide with positive political reform, with a liberal spackling of *The Lord of the Rings*' worldbuilding. Young everyman who the audience of nebbish young boys about 8-11 can identify with finds out he's been Jesus the whole time, assembling a team of wacky, interesting side characters, evil villain bent on diabolical total world domination, climactic showdown where the hero's true power is revealed, and cap it off with the hero ascending to a vacant throne after marrying the spunky princess that was tagging along and with whom he'd grudgingly fell in love with, the end.

The end result is usually that the heroes don't usually need to do that much rebuilding, because the climactic showdown isn't usually fought after a protracted land invasion of the good guys' territory. Nor still is there much focus on the ""after the coronation"" part of the story. That interferes with the power fantasy.

It is tropey, the plot is not super complicated, and all of the Eddings books seem formulaic.  I've often wondered if David read Joseph Campbell, The Hero With A Thousand Faces  and that was the ""certain technical and philosophical ideas concerning the genre"" that was referenced in the bio at the end of the books. 

Some of The Belgariad  has definitely not held up.  But they are like the junk food of fantasy novels.  Even though not great literature they still taste pretty good.   At the time I first read them, I had found the Hobbit, devoured it, and then read the LOTR.  A friend recommended Sword of Shannara.  After that,  I read the first two Thieves World books.  And then I discovered The Belgariad.  

One of the strengths was actual female heroines in the male dominated fantasy.  I don't recall all of the stories in Thieves World, but Polgara was the first powerful female in fantasy I can recall from my youth.  That wasn't like a Lady of the Lake granting gifts to the heroes and then leaving the story, Galadriel looking at you, even though you are awesome. They were the first books in the early 80s that I encountered like that.  A couple of years later I read Elfstones and Wishsong of Shannara, and Dragonlance where female characters did have important roles so it was definitely a trend in the early 80's.

At the time I read them, I  felt like many of the female characters had an actual feminine voice, which was unusual  for a many male authors at the time.  It of course revealed later the Leigh assisted even early with the novels.  I've not re-read them in years, but I wonder how many of the women would pass the Bechdel test.  I have a feeling the answer might be only Polgara, and Ce'Nedra.

The other two strengths I felt the books had were the dialog which you mentioned.  But my favorite strength of the books was the humor.   There is a conversation later in one of the books about a philosophical question about someone learning to fly that still cracks me up to this day whenever I think about it. 

That all being said.  The Elenium is definitely better.  Sparhawk is a much more enjoyable hero than Garion who was very bland.   Even if I'm not a fan of the whole May December romance in it.",3,2026-01-25 02:58:10+00:00,LOW,1.0,7.030752314814815,The Belgariad really surprised me!

Looking at your list again, I think one that should have been suggested and wasn't is The Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander. It has some of that mythic aspect and high nobility you're looking for, though be warned, it begins even more humbly than LOtR.

Some of the books suggested to you are just flatly outside the range of your request, but you already know that. 

Some are incredibly beautiful and worthy, like The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle, and the Crystal Cave series by Mary Stewart, but still not what you're asking for. 

Others I think are a terrible fit or just terrible, like Anne Rice, or the Thomas Covenant series. 

The real trouble with what you're asking for is that it doesn't exist as such. 

Tolkien is unique. Full stop. No one else in fantasy has done what he did, probably no one in literature at all. 

Many have tried to emulate him, and only suffered in comparison. Others, more talented, have argued with him or pushed off from him in their own directions. Some of that writing is incredibly good. 

So. There are epics. There are Anglo-Saxon myth cycles (some of the Arthurian work is likely to come closest to what you want.) There is poetic prose and brilliant prose. But there is no one who is like Tolkien and even one-tenth as good as he is. 

The best suggestions on your list, IMO, are the ones who are really farthest from Tolkien, because they are the ones who are geniuses in their own right, in their own worlds. 

The other top-two writer for me is Lois McMaster Bujold. Her Five Gods series is on your list, and she's one that I will always recommend just for her sheer excellence, but she is not writing the kind of books you asked for. 

I will note that another of Bujold's fantasy series, The Sharing Knife, is interesting in part because it's one of those ""arguing with Tolkien"" series I mentioned — she's pushing back against his ideas of what kind of cultural group might produce the Rangers (like Aragorn) and also about the idea of how a real evil antagonist might manifest.

&gt;Tolkien is unique. Full stop. No one else in fantasy has done what he did, probably no one in literature at all.

For sure, I mean he was a philologist and incredibly well read. I do understand it is a unique case. Though I have high hopes for Morris and Dunsany. And I don't mind a slightly different style either as long as it demonstrates mastery of the English language. (I love English so much I can't, it's such a beautiful and simple mess compared to others that due or despite its simplicity is incredible at producing very compelling prose, unlike many more complex languages.

I started Bone Harp yesterday, because the author has a PhD in medieval studies so I was very excited. Instead I found an ok written Maglor fic, which is fine, but also I kinda don't want to read what I can write myself and better, being a non-native speaker. 

&gt;Many have tried to emulate him, and only suffered in comparison.

I think the issue is that people try to write like him without having equally vast cultural knowledge in classics etc, so it comes out to be exactly what you said, an emulation.

A quote by Bakker about Tolkien :
""Tolkien’s great literary lesson, I think, lies in demonstrating the power of layers, the way telling stories against the back drop of more ancient stories conjures the illusion of authenticity, convinces the reader, at some unconscious level, to believe in the setting, and to see the action as an organic expression of that setting. Without belief, it becomes very difficult to convey the tickle of awe, to write something truly epic. This is what makes Tolkien a revolutionary literary figure, in my view. Borges, for all his ingenuity, can only tickle your intellectual fancies. He can’t make you believe the way Tolkien can. He can’t write fiction that reads, even if only for brief moments, as scripture.""",22,2026-01-23 15:24:42+00:00,LOW,1.0,28.095532407407408,Looking for fantasy with Tolkien's prose register and emotional depth

A bit tangential, but I was reflecting a while ago about how fantasy writing nowadays is self-referential.

The Seamus Heaney translation is pretty accessible, to my memory, and you can really see the influence it had on Tolkien, particularly in his Rohan poetry.  Pair that with Tolkien's *Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics* lecture*.* 

Similarly, you could try Tolkien's translations of medieval poetry- *The Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo* is pretty accessible and cheap these days, and it has the same kind of style because, well, it was Jirt doing the poetic styling. 

*The Divine Comedy* by Dante Alighieri is a little farther from what you're looking for, but I'd still recommend it, in the same vein that one would recommend *Beowulf* or *The Song of Roland.* Get either the translation from John Ciardi (for clarity and accuracy in the notes) or Dorothy L. Sayers (for the very Tolkienesque poetic styling.) Avoid Mary Jo Bang's translation (it's trying to be modern and accessible and is not what you want out of this).

I'd definitely recommend you try Dunsany and Gormenghast from your list- they're absolutely in the same kind of register. I'd also recommend Guy Gavriel Kay- start with *The Sarantine Mosaic* books; if you like them, you will probably like his other work. Bujold's stuff is fantastic and I'd recommend it but I think the prose styling might be too modern for this particular purpose. 

If you want something that's written *simply,* but in a similar style- kind of like the halfway point between Tolkien and CS Lewis- check out the works of Susan Cooper. *The Dark Is Rising* sequence- particularly *The Dark is Rising* and *Silver on the Tree-* have a *ton* of absolutely gorgeous prose laced with poetry and historical resonance. (In a similar vein, you might like *The Children of Green Knowe* books by Lucy M. Boston, though they're *definitely* closer to Narnia than Jirt's prose.) 

If you want something that's similar to Jirt's prose when he's writing about hobbits*- All Creatures Great and Small* by James Herriot is exactly what you're looking for. It's very simple and English-countryside-y, but the prose is really well-crafted and the narrative voice is both wry and tender. 

Like, in general, you want to be looking for either English authors who wrote between ehhh 1905 and 1975, or translations of classical epics that are not trying to be ""accessible"" and ""modern"". Virginia Woolf, weirdly enough, would be closer to what you're looking for than most modern epic fantasy. 

**SOME UN-RECOMMENDATIONS:** 

You do not want to read Kushiel's Dart for this. I love that book, but its prose is not Tolkienesque. It is baroque and ornate and incredibly vivid and that is *not how Tolkien writes*. It is also, um, X-rated, which is a mark against it if you're looking for ""something like Tolkien"". 

You also do not want to read Mark Twain for this- he has good prose stylings, but it is very sparse and surprisingly modern, even in stuff like *Connecticut Yankee* which is riffing on historical/epic styles. 

H.P. Lovecraft is another 'no, do not'. Lovecraft's prose is incredibly clunky- this is not a criticism, it works well for what he's doing, but it is not at all Tolkienesque.

**A Canticle for Leibowitz** by Walter Miller, jr - this covers the recovery from nuclear apocalypse and a following era of *extreme* anti-intellectualism in three sections set respectively 600 (dark age), 1200 (renaissance), and 1800 (extrasolar colonies) years after the bombs fell. This is a classic for good reason.

**Jon Shadow** trilogy by David Gemmell - three centuries after the apocalypse the population level is still way down, but most people are living in flourishing communities and nation building is in its infancy, though dangers lurk outside civilization. Some people live in-between. Follow Jon Shannow, the Jerusalem Man, a righteous drifter, righter of wrongs, and broken soul, in his search of the lost Jerusalem or a measure of peace. It is a post-apocalyptic western with magic elements, and why aren't you reading it already?

**Empire of the East** trilogy by Fred Saberhagen - the nuclear holocaust was stopped while in progress by the laws of physics changing. Most technology is out, and magic is in. Casualties are significant, but centuries later the world has mostly recovered under the rulership of Jon Ominor, master of the demon Orcus and Emperor of the East. Follow young Rolf, a peasant farmer and unexpected technological prodigy, as he joins the rebellion against the evil empire and embarks on a quest for the mythical technological weapon known as Elephant.

There is a sequel to the trilogy set in its future, and Saberhagen's **Sword** series is set later yet in the same setting, but by then the series is pretty much indistinguishable form non-postapocalyptic fantasy.

\---

These are more tangential.

**Mistborn** trilogy by Brandon Sanderson - the apocalypse happened a long time ago, the world has mostly recovered or adapted to the new normal, and the world is unified under the wise leadership of the eternal Lord Ruler. What could possible go wrong?

**Wheel of Time** by Robert Jordan - the apocalypse happened so long time ago it is mythology to most people and nation states have been around ""forever"", but I guess it qualifies though its focus is more properly pre-apocalyptic than post-apocalyptic.

**Lord of the Rings** by J.R.R.

She absolutely loves it: in the evening, when I come home from work, she’s waiting for me with the book in her hand.

Have any of you read the entire book to a 5-year-old? If so, how did they experience the second part?

I don't see Lord of the Rings there, perhaps you can add it on your tbr if you have not read them? 
You can start with The Hobbit, it can perfectly function as a standalone and not too long. 
The caveat is that The Hobbit is technically a children book, but doesn't mean it's childish or shallow. 

If you like The Hobbit then Lord of The Rings should definitely be up next. 
Then I will leave it up to you whether you want to explore other Tolkien's works.

If you don't mind LitRPG subgenre, and you love beer, one of the funniest new series I started last year is called **Beards &amp; Beers, an Adventure in Brewing**. Author is **JollyJupiter**. Human Master Brewer dies and is Isekied into the body of a dwarf (serving a prison sentence in a mine of all places). While its a shock for Pete, he can handle it. The luxurious beard will take some getting used to, especially on the women, but if there is one thing Pete knows about all those LOTR films, its that Dwarves love beer (or maybe its fighting he can't remember), but with how his fellow dwarves are talking up their first lunch break Pete is really looking forward to his first taste of a beer that has been perfected literally for millennia without changing. With his first taste Pete's mind is set, this is the most disgusting rancid bathwater that he has ever tasted. He sets out to first get out of prison, and then to break into the ranks of the master brewers and show these dwarves what real craft beer should be.

It is LitRPG so there are discussions of spells and abilities along with attributes points the characters use to level up, though for me at least this took a big back seat to the story, characters, and the humor. The author really knows his stuff when it comes to brewing beer and I swear I actually learned something.

It does not have any epic battles or world ending quests to perform, in fact the only real fight in book 1 takes place during a drinking competition (and it is hilarious). Everything is about brewing and making beer along with building up a tavern business to make the best beer. It also doesn't have much of a romance subplot other than the love a dwarf has for a goat, btu that is perfectly natural and does not need to be talked about.

It also has the funniest fart joke, that is a plot point I have ever read. 3 books out in the series so far (through Audible and in print).",1,2026-01-22 04:29:55+00:00,LOW,1.0,20.81943287037037,Dwarf or Adventure Type Books

To me, the main example is LoTR. There's not so much stagnation as there is decay; a central theme is the death of magic and the birth of the age of Man, and with it the advent of Man's magic, industry. Why is industry often depicted as evil and a king with a divine mandate seen as the best form of government? Well thats just Tolkien being a traditionalist.


The other example I csn think of is ive read a fair number of DnD novels, and unfortunately stagnation in the setting is just the price you pay when reading a tie-in to a ttrpg; there can never be serious upheaval or progress, because much of the setting is defined by what's already printed in the game books. There's traditionally been some in-lore change and upheaval as they've changed editions of the game (magic systems will change between editions, and they've done cool events spanning multiple running book series where they depicted and explained that in-universe) but theyre generally not going to do away with popular cities, characters, or player races because those things might be involved in games run at thousands of tables. ",13,2026-01-22 05:03:24+00:00,LOW,1.0,3.9594328703703705,"As a history fan, the ""3,000 Year Stagnation"" trope breaks my immersion more than dragons do."

Since they were both half elven, they were given the same choice that Arwen had in the movies which is they could decide to commit their souls to the Elvish side of the afterlife or the human side of the afterlife (btw sorry if you know all this already! I just like talking about it!)

Elrond chose the elves and Elros chose humans so all of Elros's descendants were humans, but they were, to put it simply, better than other humans. He founded the island nation Numenor, and the Numenoreans were a new subrace of man that were long lived (like 400+ years), taller, stronger than normal humans, smarter, more morally upright, more beautiful, etc etc. 

But every generation was slightly less impressive than the last. Elros's genetic influence was diluted by marriages with regular humans and also just by time. Eventually, the whole nation had a major fall from grace and most of the Numenoreans got drowned as a punishment. It's a long story. Some of them escaped to Continental middle earth, where they became the rulers of Gondor and Arnor, but the same thing happened with the descendants becoming more and more like regular humans. And Isildur was one of them and fell to the temptation of the Ring. We could talk about how it's literally impossible to NOT fall to the temptation of the Ring, but this is how the movie presents the situation. So yeah, Elrond is majorly disappointed in the whole race. BTW he will never see his twin again, not even when he spends an eternity in the afterlife, and the same goes for his daughter Arwen.

1000%. I've had to listen to Andy Serkis narration of The Silmarillion about a hundred times, because the changing and evolving cultures of the multiple races is ridiculously complex and I always lose track.

Tolkien talks extensively about different crafts and skills that were either taught by the Valar or developed independently, like metalworking, gemology, fiber arts, writing, musical arts, etc. The whole point of The Silmarillion was detailing the long term fallout of Feanor throwing a massive hissy fit because of drama around the output of a technology he created. 

The Sundering of the Elves, and this back-and-forth-to-Valinor shit the Noldor pulled created massive divergences in the technological advancements (or lack thereof for some) between the Eldar and the Grey Elves. The different paths taken by the multiple groups of Men that came out of the East, like Beor of the Edain, and the people of Haleth, the different groups of Dwarves and their exiles that developed their own independent civilizations that waxed and waned, the rise and fall of the Numenorians, etc. Valinor itself was drastically impacted multiple times early on, and Arda was remade a couple times.

You often see histories where an Empire has lasted for 3,000+ years, or a ""Dark Age"" has lasted for a millennium, and the technology or society looks exactly the same at the end as it did at the start.

&gt;In our real-world history, 3,000 years took us from the Bronze Age Collapse all the way to the iPhone. 

Bear in mind: in *The Lord of the Rings* there has been a literal devil creating monsters that keep people from being able to travel the roads for hundreds of years. 

In the larger timeline: Numenor *was* advancing technologically, and it is implied they were well on their way to flight had it not been for the entire nation's downfall (and complete destruction). The Shire has clocks, coffee, and other more modern comforts thanks to its proximity to Numenor's remnants, who are themselves destroyed by the same supernatural forces in later years. 

Middle-earth is supposed to be a mythological *pre*history, more akin to ancient places *far* older than the Roman Empire. Sure, if you look at the most *recent* history, we have exponentially larger leaps, but prior to that we had *literal thousands* of years of ancient civilizations that had to do all the groundwork from record-keeping to ship-building, and by those metrics, Tolkien's Middle-earth seems to be on par with an accurate timeline. They also had other mythological races that brought comforts from places like Valinor or magical metals that they traded with the mortal race of Men, which would have removed some of the necessity of technological advancement. Given that Men were constantly being sabotaged by orcs, trolls, and a literal demigod for much of their history, and had other races to help prop them up just to survive, it isn't a stretch to say that it took thousands of years to go from Beleriand, where they little, to Numenor, where they advanced, to Gondor where they were trying to pick up the pieces while Sauron was constantly attempting their total subjugation if not annihilation.

Elves in Lord of the Rings already had their wars with lots of their kind getting cut down. Lives that could have lived endlessly. They likely wanted to be chill. Especially knowing the rings of power they hold is the reason they get to prosper endlessly.

Not only would their culture keep them static, but they have little need for advancements. Progression might even be shunned if new ideas requires dangerous activities, whatever they might deem dangerous.

In other worlds and stories, sometimes inventing can be frowned on, or considered dangerous. Maybe mechanical tech is slow because it's easier to make a spell that does better, spells are more portable afterall.

Especially if the world has a series of different monsters that people struggle with. Distracting from truly sitting down and studying to make the next big thing in science.

Which could mean colonies and communities are in higher demand of strong hard headed workers or warriors, not intelligent desk scholars. And again, if you wanted to be a smart person and study, most would probably choose either magic, or alchemy(still magic)

Steam tech was invented long before it was a country wide advancement. Even if something was invented for science, it probably just gets overshadowed, or converted into magic in these story worlds.

Just dogmatic insistence on creative absolutism - which is irrational - there are numerous ways to tell a story, and there's no such thing as an absolute and perfect form for a creative work of fiction.

-----

If you're going to adapt something to a new medium you HAVE to change it. You CAN'T tell the story the same way, even if you want to - and you usually don't want to, because stories are very different in different mediums. The interaction between a reader and a book and a viewer and a movie are totally different - you have to find entirely different ways to communicate with them and make them invested in your story.

- You have different tools - actual visuals, music, voice and expression, etc. 
- You have entirely different needs for timing and brevity and pacing. 
- You can't simply write exposition, you have to express things through dialogue, setting, action, and acting - and you have to make your audience understand, empathize, and emote based on how you use those tools. 
- You're both constrained and empowered by your actors - You can only do what they're capable of, and their emphasis and delivery within the story is dependent on their ability to deliver - and in turn influenced by how they deliver it. 

And every change you make to adapt to these factors will engender a cascade of need for other changes. Cut a scene or change a plot point for say pacing and focus and you have to adjust how the story works in its absence. 

So to start, it's not even about ""why"" you might change something or take creative license, an adaptation from book to movie REQUIRES significant creative license. You HAVE to take creative license, you HAVE to change things. 

-----

As to *why* you might otherwise value creative license - there's no such thing as a perfect story. There's no one, perfect way to tell a story. And for a creative work to be good, it has to feel true to its creators. A story told differently is not inherently a story told worse.

As for *why change it* - beyond everything I just said, perhaps you like the setting, or the characters, or the themes, or the story beats - and want to tell a different story using them. 

Creative license can simply be good. 

-----

Certainly adaptations can be bad, and creative license can be poorly executed. But nothing makes ""closer to the source = more better"" true. Plenty of adaptations are extremely different from the source, and better for it. 

For LOTR specifically, 1) for an adaptation, it's extremely true to the source - the changes you whine about are typically minor, and 2) while there are meaningful differences, I don't think it makes the story overall worse - they're complementary. Both can exist and both can be good, even while different.

Denethor knows of Gandalf’s ”plot” to put Aragorn on the throne of Gondor and doesn’t like it. But after the battle, he is dead and his heir is unconcious and thus out of the game. Meanwhile Aragorn has just dramatically arrived and saved the day while flying his own king’s flag. He already seems to have a lot of buy-in from southern Gondor having saved them from Umbar’s pirates and brought their forces with him to rescue Minas Tirith. Furthermore, he has a well established relationship with the king of rohirrim, a major part of the coalition force they have against Sauron. Eomer will surely accept and support his leadership as we see.

On the soft power side he not only has the legendary sword, he also demonstrates his healing hands of the king with rumours spreading throughout the city. There is also Gandalf influencing the elites. Aragorn plays the situation cleverly, camping outside instead of coming in to take the city as that could risk provoking protest or suspicion. Instead he demonstrates he is first and foremost interested in dealing with the existential threat of Sauron. Kingship only comes second.

Really, the only person who likely could at that point turn the tide against him seems to be Imrahil who sees Aragorn as a good and useful ally as well as material for king. The myth of lost Gondorian kingship allows a chance for this to happen so easily, but it is only possible under these extraordinary circumstances.

In the movies, the whole structure of Gondor is reduced to Denethor and Faramir. But even there Denethor is clearly against Aragorn taking over and Faramir is unconcious while Aragorn (supported by Eomer) saves the city and leads the victorious march against Sauron at the Black Gate.",1,2026-01-22 11:27:45+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.0,I have two theories on why they changed Denethor in the LOTR movies

Beyond having been alive to see the legitimate line to the throne of Gondor fall (legitimacy being something people always seem to underestimate the importance of in these sorts of societies), he also either has the power to call people of great political influence to his Council (movie version) OR when faced with trouble they cannot handle themselves, all of these people go to Elrond for advice (book version). 

I'll never understand the argument that Aragorn's ascent makes no sense because it feels like a position you could only take if you never read the books or you don't understand how new royal lines wind up on thrones in the first place (or reclaiming them, as in Aragorn's case). The ""worst"" sin of the plotline is that Aragorn doesn't have to confront Faramir (due to convenient unconsciousness) to take the throne but tbh Faramir was never raised with an expectation of taking the throne for himself so it may not have been much of a confrontation. 

Imrahil *could* vie for the throne but he's already in charge of Dol Amroth and his position isn't likely to change much under Aragorn's rule but if he tries to go to war against the guy who just saved the kingdom he could very likely end up dead. So even if he hated Aragorn... why would he do that. If Faramir was against Aragorn's ascent after healing then it would make more sense of Imrahil to support him in a later war against Aragorn as an ""Usurper"" but this claim would be flimsy given Aragorn's bloodline is legitimized by Elrond (but given Elrond is no longer present it could work). Still, Aragorn would have the support of much of Gondor, certainly the south as you say, (there's no reason they'd all turn if he's ruling well), Rohan, the dwarves, and can pull resources from the southern kingdoms he's conquered.

Ohhhhhh, you're one of THOSE Tolkien fans. Joking, joking, sort of. But yes, Denethor being a complete jerkass versus a more noble figure is something that has been something that was debated in Tolkien fandom for decades before the Jackson movies. The previous (animated) movies both depicted him as a complete angry lunatic and lesser villain with the hardcore Tolkien fandom being furious over this. When I first read the book at 13, I was like, ""He is a real POS."" It was only reading online that I got exposed to all of his defenders who saw him as this far more nuanced character.

Some of these saying he was one of the greatest leaders in the book.

I mean the guy accuses Gandalf of running a conspiracy against Gondor from the moment he arrives, hates on Faramir the perfect son, constantly favored Boromir when GOD HIMSELF was telling him Faramir was a better son, planned to hide away the Ring like it could be concealed once found, and eventually tries to commit ritualist suicide without checking to see if his son actually did. 

Yes, Denethor WAS an extremely competent king but that was before the Palantir warped his mind. He was also an arrogant, racist, imperialist, and paranoid ruler that nurtured the worst qualities in his sons while hating the better ones.",2,2026-01-22 12:57:16+00:00,HIGH,4.0,309.6694791666667,I have two theories on why they changed Denethor in the LOTR movies

You don't vote for kings. 

&gt; He just shows up with a special sword given him by an immortal supernatural person of nobility

Symbolism is very important in establishing kingly / ruling authority and legitimacy. 

&gt; and the army of undead minions he only got with that sword

&gt; suddenly he is in charge of the entirety of Gondor's military forces and gets crowned King later without any Gondorian having so much as a line... The only thing going for him otherwise is that he is a relatively decent bloke.

I mean... He was already Chieftain of the Dúnedain with ruling authority and effectively a kingdom, had spent many decades with extensive experience fighting wars across middle earth including for many years as a captain in actual Gondor's armies where he had great success fighting Gondor's enemies, had extremely powerful allies in Gandalf, the elves, and Rohan - who he had just helped win their own war and who in turn showed up to save Gondor in their most pressing hour of need at Aragorn's behest (and formed half of their combined remaining forces - so a pretty important seat at the table), and just so happened to have a legitimate claim to the throne which the Stewards of Gondor had kindly maintained throughout their rule as a means of legitimizing their own authority. 

Add that the need was desperate and that the ruling line had lost both its head and prime heir, and it's actually extremely reasonable that they'd turn to Aragorn without much complaint. 

&gt; It's all rather questionable and I think it only works because movie-Denethor is so unlikable and incompetent. 

It's hard to lose legitimacy faster as a ruling house than to 1) suddenly lose your popularly beloved and experienced heir, 2) go actually mad from the grief and Sauron's meddling, 3) repeatedly lose battles against Sauron (including your prior capital, Osgiliath - lost by your second heir) until they actually breach your capital city, and then 4) attempt to burn yourself and your remaining heir alive - including your patriarch / head of house actually succeeding in burning himself to death.

True, but in the movies the sword maketh the man for the most part while it's the other way around in the book. There Aragorn truly is Elendil returned, sword or no sword.

&gt;Add that the need was desperate and that the ruling line had lost both its head and prime heir, and it's actually extremely reasonable that they'd turn to Aragorn without much complaint.

Faramir still lived even if he was incapacitated at the time. Of course the complete absence of any kind of chain of command and someone like Imrahil in particular is part of the larger problem of with the film's depiction of Gondor. Denethor's characterization is another part.

Joel Rosenburg -- Guardians of the flame (80s-2000s isekai/proto-litrpg)

Tanya Huff -- A big mix of stuff, starting in the early 90s. Blood Price (Vampires), Summon the Keeper (... cozy hellmouth?), Sing the 4 quarters (bards), and many others.

Michael Stackpole -- These weren't epic *series*, but epic fantasy single novels, for the most part. My favorite was 'Once a Hero'.

Melanie Rawn -- Dragon Prince. Straightforward epic fantasy.

Dave Duncan -- The Seventh Sword series (technically 1988, but more like the above than LOTR). He has a ton of other series, too.

LE Modesitt -- The 'Recluce' saga. An interesting twist on epic fantasy.

Mickey Zucker Reichart -- the 'Renshai' series. Sort of norse-inspired epic fantasy

Barry Hugheart -- 'Master Li and Number Ten Ox' really fun twisted take on chinese folklore/sherlock holmes.

**Temporary People** by Deepak Unnikrishnan - 3/5 - (Bingo - Short Stories HM, Small Press and Self Published HM, Author of Colour, Stranger in a Strange Land HM, A Book in Parts)


*Temporary People* is a short story collection centering stories of migrant workers in the Gulf states, primarily UAE. A lot of them are absurdist and/or surrealist, with a lot of allegorical stories about the plight of migrant workers (such as a couple linked stories about workers grown like corn, who end up unionising and rebelling, or a nurse who puts construction workers back together after they fall off tall buildings). The earlier stories were pretty good, but the latter ones dragged on for me. It's certainly an interesting collection though, and worth the read for a completely unique collection of (mostly) speculative short stories.

**The Black Tides of Heaven** by Neon Yang - 2/5 - (Bingo - Author of Colour, Down with the System, LGBTQIA+ Protagonist HM)

I really liked the premise for this - engineers doing a revolution against a magocracy, with a sibling rivalry thrown in - but it did not manage to pull it off in my opinion. Reading this felt like being given a highlights package of a good book - all we got were the emotional moments and the climactic scenes, but they don't really work without the context as to why they are emotional or pivotal. For example, the Machinists - the faction rebelling against the magocratic Protectorate/Tensorate, aren't really introduced as a thing until the main character joins them - there's no build up to the rebellion, we have no context for it at all (no history of the thing they're rebelling against given). On top of this, the characters feel paper thin and caricaturish, and I couldn't take it seriously when calling the mystical magical force ""the Slack"". It did do interesting things with gender, which I would have liked to see more of an exploration of.

**Valuable Humans In Transit and Other Stories** by qntm - 4.5/5 - (Bingo - Short Stories HM, Small Press and Self Published, Epistolary)

A set of incredibly inventive short stories, some in the SCP style,  others in more conventional prose and some more epistolary in style. If you like the ""thought experiment in story form"" that Ted Chiang has, then these stories are worth reading.

**Currently Reading:**

*Walking Practice* by Dolki Min - I'm about 1/4 of the way through, and it's fun so far. Imagine the monster from *Someone To Build A Nest In* in a modern Korean city but they are entirely unrepentent.

They played the other movies too, but Two Towers was the only day I was free to watch one, which I'm okay with because that one is probably my favorite. 

When I was in middle school, my stepdad tried to introduce me to the LOTR movies, which he was right to do, but maybe it wasn't the best method to show all the extended editions back-to-back to a 12 year old. Of course I fell asleep and was unable to appreciate them. It wasn't until about 2 years ago that I actually managed to watch them for real and appreciate all that was happening. So this was my first time seeing one in theaters, and Two Towers is so good for this. There are so many good crowd-moments in Two Towers, from ""They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard"", Aragorn kicking the helmet, ""You have no power here"", ""Po-tay-toes"", and basically all of Helm's Deep. My personal favorite ""hell yeah"" moment is Legolas shield-surfing down some stairs, I always cheer at that part. Another guy in my row sat up in his chair for the ""It's just like in those stories Mr Frodo"" scene, which hit especially hard this time around with all that's been going on in the world lately.

Performances are bored and stale (the main commander guy sees his son get killed and barely reacts at all). I just watched it yesterday but can’t remember any characters names. There are no arcs or journeys or growth of any kind. The CGI is hideous. 

You can tell it’s a poorly made film right from the opening scene. It starts with a human and orc squaring up to have fight, they stride to the left and right of each other, waiting for the other to make the first move, building tension, then the orc brings down his hammer on the humans shield… and then… **cut to black**. Next scene plays. We aren’t actually shown the fight. Set up, no pay off. Boring way to start a film.

c7388b9a-50fa-4145-951c-2560ac5f3cee,1qhocfj,Fantasy,apcymru,"Such a good book. This review really reminded me that 

1. Unless you see the full director's cut, the movies are unfair to Gimli as all his serious bits are left out, making him seem solely comic relief instead of a character with more depth. But the Directors Cut shows that Jackson understood his true character, just didn't have time for him. 

Unlike...

2. The movies made a complete mess of Faramir. His stern, yet gentle nobility and honour made him an absolute paragon of a man, a throwback to the noble Gondor of the past. A leader of men. ""He can master both man and beast"" is I believe the line in book 3. I think Jackson wanted to emphasize the power of the ring and instead made Faramir seem an indecisive milquetoast, prey to the whims of his father. His suicide mission in movie 3 makes it seem like he lacks judgement and any of his own agency ... It is nothing like his real job of reinforcing and holding the outforts in book 3. Which was a risky but a more reasonable decision. 

I love the movies. I own a complete boxed set, extended, blue-ray edition ... and think in general Jackson did a great job. But he missed the boat with Faramir.",20,2026-01-20 02:39:05+00:00,LOW,1.0,32.862233796296294,Finally Read The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien for the First Time...and WOW

**Stone of Tymora Series**\- (*part of DnD Cannon*)It follows a young protagonist and the famous ""Drizzt Do’Urden"". It's written for younger readers than the main Drizzt books, so vocabulary and structure are simpler.

**The Adventurers Guild**\- It's about a group of kids who live in a town protected by professional monster-hunters and dream of becoming adventurers themselves. When those adventurers disappear, the kids are forced to team up and face real monsters, secrets, and dungeon-style dangers on their own.  
It's aimed at **middle-grade readers** with straightforward language and fun pacing.

**Dungeonology**\-It's an illustrated, in-world guide that explores dungeons, monsters, traps, and magical artifacts as if the reader is an apprentice adventurer. It explains classic D&amp;D-style concepts in short, easy sections with pictures, notes, and “found” documents instead of telling one long story.  
I think **Dungeonology** might be a THE book for you and your son if he's really loving DnD. They seem pretty engaging and much easier to follow than a normal book, but they will be great for learning lore in bite-sized pieces for the both of you so you can both get more into DnD.

***Harry*** ***Potter*** was my first foray into fantasy, and I was an adult already when those books started coming out. The first three were already published and then I got each of the remaining installments as they came out (even going to Barnes &amp; Noble at midnight to get one of them). The were NOT something I would have thought I'd like reading, but I kept getting told by everyone to just give them a try and, I loved them.

I tried fantasy a few times afterward and just couldn't find anything that scratched that particular itch.

Then a friend suggested ***Game of Thrones (ASoIaF)***. The show had just started on HBO, I believe, but I didn't have HBO and hadn't seen any of it when I started reading ***ASoIaF***. I made it through the first three books and then just had to watch the show. I never finished the remaining books. I loved the show (other than the way it ended, sigh) but I truly preferred the experience of reading those first three books.

Now I'm into a sort of cozy fantasy/romantasy mixture as those tend to give me the same feelings I had back when I read HP so long ago. I don't go for the heavy spicy romantasies (no ACoTaR or Fourth Wing for me), but I always enjoy a slow-burn romance. For instance, I love ***Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faerie*****s,** and will be continuing that series.

I haven't read these yet, but two fantasies I'm planning to read this year are ***The Name of the Wind*** by Patrick Rothfuss and ***The Lies of Locke Lamora*** by Scott Lynch, both which seem accessible and interesting to me.

I have mixed feelings on ***The Hobbit***. I've read it, heck I've taught it to my high school freshmen English classes. It just gets to be a bit of a slog to me. It probably doesn't help that I grew up watching the old cartoon movie version, so I knew the story ahead of time and what would happen. I don't do well reading books if I already know what happens.

Oh, another fun one is ***The Night Circus*** by Erin Morgenstern.

That can definitively make something mainstream, see The Witcher (very much unknown outside Poland before the games) or Cyberpunk (when it was a tabletop only). However, adapted video games are rare or they are more the other way around (the IP is already mainstream and get a video game, see Star Wars, The Expanse, Game of Thrones, Avatar, Alien, Robocop, Marvel, DC, LOTR....). Guess with big AAA games it makes sense as those projects are super expensive (so risk involved if you take an unknown IP). Plus, I guess studios want to own their IP, business wise it's better 

One that will soon grow in popularity is likely to be Warhammer. Although it's already big, it's not the widest mainstream yet, a live action TV show is certainly a way to make it explode. Many video games have their adaptations coming (Mass Effect, God of War,...) too which will grow them.

If he is determined to go for it, as it seems to be the case, I think it's more likely to be an ok adaptation at best.

If he used his influence and connections to get an established animation studio it would be entirely different case, but animation has a growing but limited reach. Sanderson seems to be hell bent on hitting it as big as possible so it seems unlikely. 

If I were him I would try to get an anime studio (or known for their quality to get Tress adapted into a stand alone season. (stand alone, visually engaging, simple story and unlike Yumi is not a repackaged *Your Name*) Book media would get the ball rolling and if the quality was good the anime community would jump on the wagon. If I felt that this studio could be the one to potentially follow I'd have an added scene with something along the line of Hoid talking about different places and having short but recognizable glimpses into Roshar, Scadrial and other places.

For the live action route I believe it to be a dead end. But Sanderson seems to have insane luck on his side (him being picked to finish WoT skyrocketing his popularity in the community, a chance other authors can dream to have) and as I said he is relentless so who knows. I think his books are too much of a financial sinkhole, because the fantasy element is so everpresent.

The hobbit is simple enough as well. I read Lord of the rings at 12, so the hobbit is a good introduction to more complex fantasy.

A Wrinkle in Time is great and another good one to read with her.

Eragon is a good choice for heavy fantasy. I always think of it as a gateway to Lord of the Rings since that can be a bit much to read when you're 8.

031c691b-da66-4fdc-bf90-ffb1279d823e,1qf7a9g,Fantasy,Somniumi,"Hey there! I have a 9 year old who loves to read. Over the past few years we have gone through a number of books together, some with me reading, others with us reading on our own. 

Some real standouts:

Kiki’s Delivery Service (a literal classic, and well worth it for both parent and child)
The Girl Who Drank The Moon (this was utterly captivating, even reading alone, I would have loved it. It does have a bit of violence)

William Joyce’s some real home runs:
Ollies Odyssey was an early read for us. She was 4 or 5, and she still talks about it. I read it aloud. 
The Guardians of Childhood series 10/10. This was her first introduction to a true series. As an adult, it’s an average read, but a great stay for kids to see how fantasy series progress. 

She read The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, and liked it, we haven’t read the second yet. 

We also read the first book in Sandersons, Alcatraz series. She really likes #1, but is having a hard time getting into the second book. She’s about 30% through and it still seems little slow. 

She devoured the Amulet Graphic novels. I’ve read two and liked them enough to want to finish them. 

My absolute favorite (not hers, lol) is The Little Prince

One weird thing we do. I’m a huge fan of GGK and I think the way that he writes is important. His work is obviously not suitable for kids, so I’ve given her excepts to read. Just so she can appreciate how different authors write. Some focus on story and narrative, others, like Kay, focus on structure, cadence and flow. 

We have a “shelf” for her on my Goodreads. If you want other recs, let me know! I’d also love to hear what your guys come up with. 

Bonus comment: my 7 year old son is not as avid about reading. He finally agreed to read a book with me and the Hobbit has been incredible. We read it together, but often go back and listen to Andy Serkis’s audiobook. I’m surprised how well received it’s been.

cb12864d-5eae-4a45-bd9f-743755e8bc76,1qf7a9g,Fantasy,SapphicSwordGirl,"As a former eight-year-old girl who adored reading fantasy:

\- Ranger's Apprentice series by John Flanagan (consistent medieval fantasy with lots of books and lore to throw oneself into. page-turning plot and advancing emotional stakes. cool sequel series with strong female MC as well)

\- Wildwood series by Colin Meloy (urban-ish modern fantasy that functions as a modern folk tale with whimsical woodland creatures, sad orphans, and plenty of contrived magical politics. great trilogy)

\- Earthsea series by Ursula K. Leguin (you cannot go wrong here. I had the full set as a kid and devoured it. such a classic fantasy that doesn't center typical medieval european conventions)

\- The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper (cornish, welsh, and english folklore combine to create a thrilling series that doesn't hold young reader's hands with darkness, but is still kind enough to be very digestible for children. is easy to read without compromising great prose)

\- The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien (this should be required reading. I read the 50th anniversary edition when I was seven and never looked back. a great warm-up before introducing LoTR in middle school)

\- A Wrinkle in Time by Madeline L'Engle (the first book I read as a child where I felt seen as a young girl. meg is such an identifiable protagonist, and the themes of science and philosophy involved will make any reader feel like the smartest in the room)

\- Percy Jackson Universe by Rick Riordan (such great fun. I went to the library every weekend for these. not exactly cerebral or anything, but amazing representation for lots of kids who have dyscalculia, dyslexia, ADHD, and other learning disabilities)

\- The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame (a sweet and charming little fairy tale that captivated me as a child. I read this alongside Beatrice Potter and Arthur Conan Doyle)

\- Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (the protagonist is a child criminal. there are faeries that live underground. what more could you want)

\- School for Good and Evil series by Roman Chainani (this one gets a bit more mature as it advances, but I read the first book when I was your daughter's age. compelling female friendships and good introduction to narrative subversions in a fairytale setting)

\-  Fablehaven series by Brandon Mull (I CANNOT recommend this series enough! it is an incredibly underrated fantasy romp about siblings who work at a wildlife preserve for magical creatures. I was so inspired reading it as a kid I filled an entire sketchbook with fan art)

\- The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman (if your kid has some gothic tendencies, this is the moody introduction for her. I enjoyed both the original text and the brilliant graphic novel adaption as a child. the author sucks, unfortunately, but I would be remiss not to recommend this)

\- Gregor the Overlander series by Suzanne Collins (yes! she didn't only write the hunger games! this series is a great bridge between elementary and middle-grade)

\- The Mysterious Benedict Society series by Trenton Lee Stewart (one of the most foundational book series I ever read as a child. opened up a whole new realm of imagination, problem-solving, and alternative thought. I probably wouldn't be pursuing the career I am today-- research science-- without books like this)

\- His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman (as others may have said, this one can get pretty dark, but I thoroughly enjoyed it in 4th and 5th grade. great female MC and incredible world building that inspires. one of my first 'grown-up' fantasy series)

\- Spiderwick Chronicles by Tony DiTerlizzi (this series is an easy read with beautiful illustrations that delves into folksy urban fantasy and well-written sibling dynamics)

\- The WondLa Series by Tony DiTerlizzi (this might be my ultimate recommendation. I still re-read this trilogy today. incredible science fantasy with compelling, emotional story arcs, gorgeous art, expert prose, and supremely innovation/imaginative world building elements. I could sing its praises all day long. do your daughter a favor and hand her these books)",1,2026-01-17 16:55:14+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.0,Fantasy recommendations for 8 year old girl

496ed9bb-a35e-4a39-b242-17677395d4c5,1qf7a9g,Fantasy,PiraticalGhost,"That's brilliant!

I think Narnia is a good first stop. There are lots of books, and a lot of them are a little different. My mother and I read them when I was around ages 6-8 (many moons ago!)

Some of Terry Pratchett's Disc World can be good as well - the Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents for example - for a child who reads a year or two above typical age level. But that is definitely a case of picking and choosing books - there a lot of really important lessons in his books, but what your daughter is ready for is another question.

I think The Hobbit can be brilliant - it was literally born of the stories Tolkien told his young children at bedtime. And, if you are comfortable with serious topics, I think that Lord of the Rings can be really good for child-led storytimes because it is challenging. If she's resilient and doesn't get upset at ""failure"", navigating LotR is a great way for them to read to you or with you, while you help with the sticky bits. But only after The Hobbit - The Hobbit sets up a lot of the ""heart"" of the stories I feel, and once you have that, the rest comes naturally.

I also think things like The Wizard of Earthsea can be really impactful because of how it deviates from post-Tolkien fantasy conventions in terms of tone and worldbuilding.

All of this does have to be taken with the grain of salt that I was a *very* strong reader. So a lot of books I encountered way younger than typical.",1,2026-01-18 22:21:31+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.0,Fantasy recommendations for 8 year old girl

The reason you were downvoted is that no one knows what specific modern fantasy you're talking about. Like, is  Kingkiller Chronicles written like a video game? No. What about The Gentleman Bastard series? No. What about The Fifth Season? No. Greenbone Saga? No. Poppy War/Babel/Katabasis? No. China Miellville's  New Weird books? No. Fourth Wing and other Romantasies? No. Cozy Fantasy like Legends and Lattes and other books in its series? No. The Second Apocalypse series by Bakker? No. The Hierarchy by James Islington? No. That's why someone asked if you're only talking about self-published works/Lit RPG books that never made it on anyone's radars.

People are downvoting you because you don't actually sound like you have *read* any ""modern"" books. It just sounds like you're giving empty, cliche criticism in an attempt to big up your own work in comparison, in order to promote it. The only modern fantasy author that people sometimes compare to video games is Sanderson's way of using magic systems in his action.

-----

**All that being said:** I went ahead and read the amazon previews for one of your own novellas that are ""unlike modern fantasy"". It reads like it's written by someone who doesn't read enough to know how books are supposed to be written. It's littered with style errors in terms of basic dialogue tag convention that every published book follows. It shifts between past tense and present tense from sentence to sentence as if you don't know what tense means in writing; it is impossible to ascertain what tense your book is actually meant to be in because it's not like it's present tense 70% and past tense 30%---it's more like this sentence starts in past and somehow still ends up in present. Like it's completely sporadic. Either you don't understand tense, or you do and didn't bother to proofread your book before throwing it on amazon.

Then let's talk about your fight scenes by the end of the chapter. You mentioned in another reply that  your action scenes are ""Grounded in HEMA"". They are not good. The problem is they read clinical, almost as boring in the way a distant historical text is boring, because you're prioritizing the fight scenes as opportunities to unload your knowledge of HEMA and terms related to HEMA. But since the vast majority of readers do not know HEMA, it just reads like you're using esoteric terms and descriptions, like you're writing in another language. But not in a good way, in a way as if you're trying to teach HEMA clinically through your step by step description, not actually channelling the emotion of the action and voice of the characters. What you need to do is use your knowledge of HEMA to inform your fight scenes in terms of choreography and physical logistics of movement, not dump your weapon knowledge and HEMA knowledge onto the scene. That's the temptation of knowledge, you must resist the urge to show it off, but let it work like an iceberg basis beneath the visible tip that is the surface of what you actually write.

All in all, you shouldn't be complaining about any ""modern fantasy book."" Edit yours, have it properly formatted for amazon so that it reads professional, have dialogue tags properly done in the recognizable pattern of style that every published work does, stick to either the past or present tense, do more in your narrative than take the opportunity to describe weapons and armor i.e. more than as an opportunity to dump your HEMA/medieval weapons-armor knowledge, put some actual motion and emotion and life in your fight scenes instead of diagramming fights in a more technical way that fits your HEMA knowledge (which requires you to play with sentence length, rhythm, and grammar). Write your book in a way that makes you feel pride in comparison to your giants. If your book has obvious mistakes, don't insult ""modern fantasy books"" in an attempt to promote your book---because I'm sure there are plenty of videogame style fantasy books better written than what you put up, given how elementary the mistakes are in your work.",1,2026-01-17 17:34:27+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.0,Does anyone else HATE action scenes?

9e97ae21-00da-43aa-864d-099a1562cbeb,1qeaupy,Fantasy,Wanderer_Falki,"I think what you are at least partly looking for is the narrative concept of adventure, as opposed to the 'quest' narrative. The Hobbit was inspired by both these aspects (as taken from Arthurian Romances), and it works in this case because while Smaug is the antagonist within the Dwarves' quest, the story is told from Bilbo's point of view; and for him, the whole journey is closer to an adventure, a series of events along the way that aren't necessarily interconnected and do not necessarily have a clear goal.

Of course he does share the Dwarves' goal, but for most of the adventure Smaug acts more like this far away goal than an actual antagonist; and after his death, it's shown that the real antagonist of the whole book is more abstract: it's greed, of which Smaug was simply a sort of embodiment. That's why it feels like the book doesn't have one central antagonistic character despite Smaug being the explicit goal of their quest.

After all, the real focus of the story isn't the plot (including the main quest of retaking Erebor from its main antagonist Smaug): it is more character-centered, about Bilbo's internal journey. So while I don't have any specific book in mind to recommend, I think the kind you're looking for is more character- or theme-focused with a more abstract ""antagonist"".",12,2026-01-16 11:08:00+00:00,HIGH,5.0,442.12642361111114,"What are some good fantasy novels similar to the Hobbit, where the main characters are journeying across the world, and there's no one single consistent antagonist?"

- Wheel of Time is a middling, derivative cliche story at the beginning, the characters are often infuriating, the infamous slog is very much real, the author transition isn't as smooth as it could've been. I still love it though.

- Stormlight Archive falls off quite heavily after the third book. Sanderson needs an editor to keep him in check. Book 4 is a boring slog. Something about the tone and modern therapy talk in book 5 really rubs me the wrong way. Sanderson handles themes with the subtlety of a bulldozer.

- ASOIAF is a jumbled mess towards the end and I don't see any way for Martin to write a satisfying ending. Let's face it, he's unlikely to write it anyway. It has a lot of loose threads that go nowhere

Mistborn: The characters are sort of generic.


Dungeon Crawler Carl: The plot often tries to up the stakes in an imo artificial way. ""You thought you would fight a boss? Nah here are 5 Country level bosses and 2 gods thrown in as well.""


Locke Lamora: The quality drops after book 1. Also the plot of book 1 kicks in halfway through, pretty late. Great book tho.

Wheel of Time: Gender essentialism and heavy emphasis on enmity between the genders that only lets up at the very end

Lord of the Rings (a.k.a. the only series on this list I haven't avoided in favor of lesser-known but more female-friendly alternatives): Women play small roles, but at least those roles are usually heroic and often pivotal.

I'd like some recommendations for fantasy books or series to read, as I'm in the mood for it, but I don't know what to choose, because...there are so many options. I used to read more in the past, and I want to get back into the habit.


Some things to consider:


I definitely prefer ""medieval"" fantasy to Sci-Fi, although I like both.


I love rich lore and world-building, and for it to be an important part of the book or series. I feel that some books that focus much more on the characters than on their world don't really grab me the same way.


I don't mind humor, but I prefer humor that isn't too much ""contemporary"". I don't know if I'm explaining myself well. I like the humor, the memes, etc of our current time, but not in a fantasy world, or at least not too mich of that.


I don't mind if it's more ""dark"" or ""grim,"" but in general, I like the balance between dark and lighter moments.


My all-time favorite, TBH the first thing I read as a child: Lord of the Rings and everything related to The Middle-Earth, because of the elegance of its lore.


I don't like Sanderson very much. I've read about seven books: Elantris, the first three of Mistborn, and Stormlight, and I don't think they are for me.


I'm currently reading The Realm of the Elderlings (I've finished The Farseer Trilogy), but I need a break. I loved the first book, but I struggled with the last one in that trilogy for various reasons that aren't relevant here. But I'll eventually continue it.


Other books and series that I've enjoyed to varying degrees: Dune, ASOIAF (not all of them, but I'll read them in the future), The Witcher (some books more than others), and The Kingkiller Chronicle.


Thanks in advance!!

*Under the Eye of the Big Bird* is a fragmentary novel / novel-in-stories set in a future Earth where humanity has long declined and consists of isolated communities that differ in strange ways. Most chapters switch POV and setting, and we get snapshots of what the world is like, slowly revealing what is consistent between the isolated communities and what changes. 

It's completely unlike anything I've read before, and is one I will certainly re-read in the future, as the latter stories make you re-examine what you have read up to that point. The best comparison in writing style I can make is to SFBC darling Thomas Ha - there's a similar sense of mystery and occlusion in these stories as there is in Ha's more dystopian work.

I also re-read **The Fellowship of the Ring**, which I haven't done for a long time. Having read a good amount of classic horror and weird lit in the last year, it's striking to see how well the early chapters, particularly those pre-Rivendell, fit with that style, the encounters with Old Man Willow and the Barrow Wights in particular.

Freiren: Loved the relaxed, introspective vibe. Demon arc in the middle boring though.
Star Wars: Didn't like the good vs evil stuff of OT, but the themes. Liked the plot, world-building &amp; themes in PT. Liked Last Jedi for its unique storyline. Absolutely loved Andor for its dialogue, themes &amp; interesting characters.
LOTR: The dialogue was too childlike, the plot too predictable, the characters were very boring and 1-dimensional.

Is your problem with the content, or how the content is being presented? I assume from you're comments that you haven't read the books you're referencing?

I can't speak to DC Carl but The Ninth House is a series I enjoyed. I wouldn't give it a universal recommendation, but I do think it is well written.

The tagline ""Lesbian Necromancers in Space"" is technically accurate, and I guess enticing to enough people (including me). But it was a description that I believe came from a marketing department rather than the author. The titular character, and some characters around her were lesbian, but their being lesbian wasn't a plot point as much as world building. There is some space travel, but the only really important part of the tagline is Necromancy. Gideon could be a straight man interacting with straight women and it wouldn't change the plot.

Would you have been more receptive to Gideon the Ninth being advertised as a ""Locked House Murder Mystery with Necromancy""?

What if we flipped the script and applied modern marketing to the classics? Would you want to read these books based on the taglines?

**The Bone Harp by Victoria Goddard** I ended up really liking this one, despite really disliking the middle section. Frankly I think it would've worked best with minimal changes to the rest of the story if it had been an interlude, but I also just don't think that Klara added much to the story and I don't think it would've lost anything thematically if she and the middle section were completely removed. It felt like we had platonic love and familial love, so surely we must have romantic love in there too, right?? But their relationship was so unconvincing.

*However*, overall I still liked this book a lot because I really enjoyed the characterization of Tamsin and the first and third parts were just nice to read. I'm not usually a cozy reader but I felt like this still had enough internal conflict and good characterization to work (usually I find cozy books too flat and boring). *Hidden Gem* for bingo!

**Natural Beauty by Ling Ling Huang** I'm sorry, I just can't. Respect to it, but it wasn't working for me and it took me a week to read half of a 270 page book. I would recommend it to others, especially those who are interested in looking at beauty standards through a race lens.  

**Heartless Hunter by Kristen Ciccarelli** Horrible, simplistic writing that beats you over the head with all the really explicitly stated thoughts and feelings of the POV characters and leaves literally no room for subtext or metaphor or anything interesting.

&gt; That's a fair interpretation, I guess I'm just not used to magic as such being equated to physical strength and im not sure I like it a lot. 

I thought it was one of the most interesting aspects of the series. It makes it stand out in comparison to other power systems, that’s for sure. I’d like to see something similar again. Not necessarily in a “this gender is stronger than this gender,” but in the sense of having a power system with gender-based strengths, weaknesses, and interactions.

&gt; But then again I am also seeing comments that claim this to not be as black and white as Azmodean claims it is in the book.

There are certainly benefits to each side, and both sides often begrudge the other for these benefits. 

&gt; This is true, I understand that much better now. To bad so many people sell it as such

True. People often sell it as such. It’s more of a heavily mixed world. I usually appreciate stories that recognize gender differences in society, as opposed to those that simply make it so that they don’t exist. That said, in WoT it feels a bit… arbitrary and forced? 

One series I found interesting in this sense was The Stormlight Archive, though it’s also a bit unpractical in the way it’s done. But I do think it’s inspired by Robert Jordan in terms of trying to find a middle ground in terms of gender, meaning both genders have their respective spheres, both genders face backlash when they try to step out of it, etc. But unlike WoT, you at least see some characters trying to reflect on these arbitrary rules, and some of them do make an effort to leave their prejudices behind, since society is changing so fast. 

&gt; I agree and I do find their institution to be interesting, as I said in the post. I think my main problem there is similar to point 2 where I came into it believing that Moraine was a female version of Gandalf.

Moiraine’s parallels with Gandalf begin and end with her being a magical figure with a staff who takes a village boy to the outside world. I’ve always seen her more as a character inspired by Lady Jessica from Dune: motherly mentor figure coming from an all-female institution guiding a male chosen one without paying heed to such institution, and who’s often very manipulative, though not necessarily evil. They even share a desert arc. Well, WoT is heavily influenced by Dune. And by Arthurian legends.

Back to LOTR, though, consider that Gandalf was one of five wizards in Middle-earth.

Moraine is also imo the wisest and most noble character in the books with Tam as a close second. She was basically written as something akin to the role a female Gandalf.


A large percentage of the really really shitty people in the books are male, some are female but most are male.

And in a similar vein - something that remains unique despite seemingly having ingredients that've been iterated on almost endlessly - I would recommend The Lord Of The Rings. 

It has a reputation as the most archetypical fantasy, but I think the guy who said that Tolkien remains ""out on a lonely promenade"" (or whatever the exact quote is) had it right. 

It's *superficially* like a lot of later fantasy that took influence from it - elves, dwarves, tree-people, quests, dire magic objects - but the resemblance isn't much more than skin deep. 

The atmosphere, vibe, language etc. was so heavily influenced by (and reeks of) the sort of ancient mythologies of Europe that Tolkien studied (Finnish, British, Germanic mainly) - these are the sorts of things he was drawing on, and in an almost umatchedly deep way (as his professional life's work was studying them as an Oxford professor) whilst many of his imitators were mainly drawing on him

I'm yet to come across another book considered solidly fantasy that has anything like the mythic quality and feel - bits of Circe (Madeleine Miller) and Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell (Susanna Clarke) are probably the closest I've gotten to it, and maybe some fantasy-adjacent stuff by Borges or Mary Renault.",1,2026-01-12 19:50:22+00:00,LOW,3.0,301.39890046296296,Recommendations to recreate the “I’ve never read anything like this” feeling.

The slow regard of silent things- in one view, a story of a mentally ill starving girl trying to survive in ruins with intense feng shui based OCD and find what joy she can, in another, a story of a girl in a broken world setting it to rights. One thing everyone can agree on is its a close look into another type of mind, with prose that's pure poetry.

The last unicorn, a story thats both a serious fantasy story and a total subversion of a fantasy story, with some of the most beautiful prose ever written.

Harry Potter and the methods of rationality, being fanfiction you'd expect it to be trash, but it's really quite something. The first good unique thing is it has a main character who's *actually* intelligent, who uses magic and science in subversive ways to solve problems and get out of jams, think doctor who or captain jack sparrow but using genuine intellect and creativity.

To expect any fantasy series to have the mythic quality and reputation of Middle-Earth. Well, it is not going to happen. Not anytime soon.


LOTR was the first modern fantasy trilogy that was a great publishing (and financial) success and became a phenomenon. Tolkien himself was really surprised.


Every publisher in the 1980s and early '90s wanted that. Which is why so many series of those times are called derivative of Tolkien.

- The **Penric and Desdemona** series by **Lois McMaster Bujold**. Light but has enough plot to keep you engaged. (*The Curse of Chalion* and *Paladin of Souls* are edge cases; they're not grim but there also is a fair bit of violence.)
- Pretty much anything by **Diana Wynne Jones**. 
- Also most of **Ursula Le Guin**. Even when dealing with serious themes she tends towards a lighter touch. The **Earthsea** books are good for this. 
- I would say a lot of **Robin McKinley**'s books would work (just NOT *Deerskin* [*edit: or maybe so, as the second half is about healing, but check content warnings first*]). Someone else mentioned *The Blue Sword* but **Beauty** and **Chalice** would also be good.

This may not be what you want, as the story revolves around magic, but it is the old, mysterious, soft magic like an old fairy tale or Lord of the Rings. Maybe something like Jane Austin meets Lord of the Rings, without the romance.

It's a historical fantasy set in England during the Napoleonic wars. Two magicians appear in England and attempt to return magic to the world. The world is incredibly rich, detailed, wondrous, and *mysterious*. 

The text is augmented with a bunch of footnotes that expand the world building (and the mysterious and otherworldly feel of the setting). For instance, the story will reference a long-dead magician and his trip to the land of the fae, and there will be a footnote with a half-page story about that event. 

The book is huge (one single volume, but it's *long*) and only has maybe five magical fights, and they are more along the lines of creating illusions to distract the French, or a magician trying to break the enchantment of a fairy to save a character from being stolen away. There are no magical duels where they throw fireballs at each other and there are no rules of magic to keep track of. 

This is a story about fleshed-out humans engaging with the return of ancient (or at least old) and mysterious magic re-entering the world.

No flashy magic system? Check. The reader and PoV characters have basically no idea how the magic actually works, and the closest thing we get to a fireball is a wizard setting a branch on fire (there's probably a largely discussion that could be had about how the trilogy was translated to the screen re: making dramatic and visual on film what was implied and muted in the books). 

Muddy world where people worry about weather, horses, debt, bad knees? Check (except the debt). It's got a reputation for lack of grittiness because it's thematically good Vs evil, but only a tiny fraction of fantasy stories write travel and its trials more realistically than LotR (and if you check out military history blog acoup.com, the professor has written multiple articles about how shockingly accurate it is on war, logistics, cities etc.).

Mythic weight? Like the biggest check in fantasy. 

Don’t want the plot to be driven by wizards dueling every 30 pages? Huge check. The two most powerful wizards have a conflict and there's no duel. A wizard (very briefly) spell-duelling a demon happens off screen. It's like Tolkien was trolling later generations of fantasy by putting almost no overt magic in his genre-defining opus. 

Swords, betrayals, oaths, messy family histories, religion that actually matters to characters, and that sense of history pressing down on everyone? Check to some; the religion stuff is pretty implicit, and some of the betrayals are again, off screen, or sort of historical. 

Bonus if it has a strong sense of place, like you can smell the wet wool and smoke, and the author doesn’t rush the travel bits. CHECK. Tolkien gets so much shit for describing the trees too much as the characters walk past them.

***The Divide*** by J.S Dewes

Another action-packed scifi series about a group of washed-up legionnaires discovering that the universe is collapsing, and that their own bosses are fascist pigs.     Full of compelling, memorable characters that feel like real, layered people.     Also full of over-the-top 80s-movie action. 

***The Winnowing Flame*** by Jen Williams

Kitchen-sink fantasy-turned-scifi that includes a rogue archeologist, a dilettante elf poser,   space witches,   Yggrasil,  dragons and griffins,  ancient alien builders,  and an invading swarm of space bugs.

9973486e-8efb-41c2-93d2-cc0dda9b4f4f,1q4jys7,Fantasy,Baltering097,"Sometimes, I think it is easy to assume that your story will be a certain number of books and then realize as you're writing it that you need more space/have more to say/more to explore. I originally planned for my series to be a duology, and realized while finalizing the outline of the second book that many story threads wouldn't have space to breathe (and also saw that I basically had two 5-act structures present anyway). So, it became a trilogy, and is much better that way. In a famous example, The Hobbit was a standalone and eventually Tolkien realized he had more to say about the world and more stories to tell, thus the creation of the main trilogy and the lore-focused books. 

Additionally, in publishing, a writer might have lots of ideas for a series (or may have already written additional books) but pitches their story as a ""standalone with series potential"". Some agents and publishers are scared off by the idea of selling a series, due to financial risk, so authors write their books as being ambiguously ended so that they work as a standalone or the jumping point for a series. This works the same if you have a 5-book series but pitch the technically-sound first 2 books as a duology. Many authors may also have two or more versions of a series, a longer, more fleshed-out version and a more condensed ""marketable"" version, (in this case a trilogy over a 5-book series). If the initial run (a standalone, duology, trilogy, what have you) sell well, the publisher is more open to a bigger deal. 

However, for books like Yarros' Empyrean series, it is clearly financial influence stretching out something that could have been finished already. Even fans of the series have complained that very little happens in the last two books. But, now that they know that it will be a financial success regardless, there is incentive to produce as many as possible while the stove is hot. The story probably could have been wrapped up in three books, but it's being intentionally stretched. 5 books is much easier to jump to from 3 than a bigger number and has more space to wrap up potential new additions than 4 (and more release dates).

THIS. RIGHT. HERE.

The show was already out of focus from the very first epside in which, on one side they gave us the most bland adaptation of The Lesser Evil (one of the stories, if not THE story, that better encapsulates Geralt as a character), and on the other side they went out of their way to represent the whole fall of Cintra (which in the books is just a ""background"" event) with the excuse of giving Ciri more screen time.

Some people are quick to use the tired ""Ciri is the main character"" excuse to defend this choice, but The Witcher is Geralt's story first and foremost. Leaving aside the fact that Ciri only debuted in the second to last short story, her role in the first 3 novels of the saga (i.e. what Netflix adapted so far) is still very limited and she's definitely NOT the protagonist of those early books. 

As a literature/narrative teacher, I often notice that these days people have some trouble distinguishing between ""Protagonist"", ""Hero"" and ""Main character"", often using those terms interchangibly, while it's much more complex than that. From a narrative standpoint Geralt is THE protagonist (and the hero) of all The Witcher books, from the first to the last one (plus the most recent prequels where Ciri isn't even present)

And while Ciri is the ""main character"" in the sense that most of the story revolves around her, up until Tower of the Swallow, from a narrative standpoint she's just the ""object of desire"". It's only in the last two novels that she gets promoted to protagonist (characterized as an anti-hero) alongside Geralt.

It's not so different from the Hobbit comparison you brought up. On paper, it wasn't a bad idea to to better develop Thorin as a character, but Bilbo is the potagonist and it should have stayed that way. Instead, by the time of the third movie he was relegated to a secondary role while not only Thorin but also Bard, Gandalf and Tauriel-Sue were stealing his screentime. 

Just like PJ/Warner could have easily made Thorin the main character while keeping Bilbo the protagonist (as perfectly shown in the M4 fan-edit), the same way Netflix could have easily kept Geralt the protagonist in his own story, while still making Ciri the central focus of the narrative, just like in the books.",2,2026-01-19 12:32:27+00:00,MEDIUM,2.0,57.89978009259259,The Netflix Show’s Descent into Mediocrity in season 4

Then morgoth( black bad man) steals the light from the sun and moon trees with ungoliath drinking them while elves and gods(Valinor ) are partying. Then a few days later Ungoliath and Morgoth find out about the silmarils and how they capture the light of the moon and sun tree. They steal them. Ungoliath wants to eat them Morgoth says nah bitch you ate enough these are mine. Ungoliath goea reee and steals the silmarils from Morgoth and flees north then east into Middle Earth. Morgoth enraged chases after Ungoliath, Feanor enraged chases after Morgoth with his noldor elves(most of them). Feanor swears an Oath of Vengeance, Mandos( god of dead  and of prophecy) speaks a prophecy where he warns Feanor that all his descendants will die chasing Silmarils never actually gaining them. Feanor doesn't give a shit. Meanwhile Morgoth catches up to Ungoliath defeats her and gets back the Silmarils. Ungoliath limps back to some cave and has descendants somehow( Shelob is her descendant in Lotr). Then Feanor wants to take ships from some other group of elves. They refuse, he steals the ships he can crew and burns the rest so that they cant follow him. They instead follow him via the north passage through the ice( where Ungoliath and Morgoth went) Celebrimbor and ( woman elf queen, forgot her name) also go with them. The third group of elves Feanor meets on the Middle Earth( the sindarin elves, Legolas is a sindarin elf) they just tell Feanor to fuck off. He tells them either you are with me or against me. He chases them off the northern Beleriand. Then Feanor dies in a pretty metal way. As soon as he was able to he raised his warhost and charged at the Morgoth's evil castle in the northern mountains. They win the battle under the stars, but Feanor was too eager in chasing down orcs, wargs and trolls so he overextends in fron of his army. He gets confronted with Balrogs and he gets slowly wittled down and gets mortally wounded. Then his sons finalyy catch up to him, and Feanor being the angry chad that he was realizes that they won't catch up to Morgoth and kill him any time soon. So he just burns to ash from rage at the fact. 

Eventually yes they beat Morgoth ans Valar imprison him outside of the Plane of existence in the ""outer world"" and he is prophecised to be able to come back to Arda( world that lotr takes place in) at the Dagor Dagerarh( or some shit like that) which is basically Christianity's Judgement say or Apocalypse.

ae945b2e-1d56-4716-9a7c-a099f6396312,1qa13sv,witcher,UrsusRex01,"I think the fact the elves are rarely depicted positively in the franchise as a whole plays a big role in that.

I'm not familiar enough with Dragon Age and Warhammer Fantasy but I suppose that, even though those settings have the same kind of racial tensions (and to be honest the Witcher novels *really* give me the impression that they're inspired by Warhammer), there are probably some elves that are depicted positively.

Plus, as someone else said, the elves of the Witcher are far from the graceful and wise beings depicted in most Fantasy stories (thanks to Tolkien). In the Witcher, elves are actually not that different from human beings. They sure have different features such as body types, eyes size or their teeth, but except for some arrogance coming from their long lifespan, they behave like humans and their culture is not that different either.

In fact, speaking of culture, some elves are depicted with negative cultural traits. For instance, in the book, we learn that the *Aen Elle*, aka the elves like Eredin, are slavers and imperialist assholes who plunder other worlds and inhabit one that they have taken by force.

And, because this is a brutal dark fantasy setting, the other elves, the *Aen Seidhe*, aren't exactly innocent either. The *Scoia'tael* commandos are not just freedom fighters who attack military convoys and fight the good fight against racist governments. The *Scoia'tael* also plunder villages and kill civilians. In their eyes : if you're human, you're an enemy, and if you're not human but don't want to fight humans then you're a traitor. As a matter of fact, in the book we get a scene where a dwarf reminds some elves talking about ""all the elder races joining force against humans"" that, before things got too hard for elves, they used to treat other non-humans with the same kind of racism that they suffer from the humans.

As for characters, we don't get to see many elves that are not part of the bloodthirsty *Scoia'tael*. Francesca Findabair, their queen, is just another manipulative sorcereress. Even Avallac'h, probably one of the most positive elven figures in the story, has his darker side.

Tl;dr : Why are elves from The Witcher not that popular? Probably because, even though we can understand where elves are coming from, most of them are depicted as awful and prejudiced and some of them are even downright evil, which is very different from the usual depiction of elves in Fantasy. The beings that are the closest to the ""Tolkien elf"" in The Witcher franchise are, ironically, the dryads and even them are prejudiced and will just kill on sight whoever enters their turf without permission.",39,2026-01-11 15:39:00+00:00,LOW,5.0,208.88484953703704,It's weird elves are not that popular here

Long lives and slower reproduction are a common theme among Elves but usually the longer lives come with insane experience and thus expertise in battle or magic. Shouldn't be surprising if an Elf swordsman, archer or mage would potentially be training and fighting for centuries. Some strong Elves (like Legolas or Drizzt Do'Urden) in fantasy pull off Witcher+ tier feats, they slaughter dozens of enemies at once, bring down giant beasts, demons, etc. In the Witcher they live long but it doesn't give them much seeing how they're being slaughtered by regular dudes (most of whom were probably illiterate farmers that got drafted).

I see some people saying “they’re like humans but with pointy ears.” I can see that — they definitely do not have this otherworldly, almost demigod-like status like the LotR elves.

An elven lover is a fantasy even in that Arthurian world Ciri visits at the very end. 

The elves also teach their kids, be they boys or girls, horse-riding and archery from an early age. They also have very distinctive clothing styles and cuisine, and come across as more refined and put together, even if they’re Scoia’tael (Blood of Elves, Geralt points out how devastated and broken the elves look after a battle in contrast to their usual clean &amp; tidy attire).

In fact, something the series barely explored is her agility / balance. Book Ciri could very much perform on a modern day circus. She is an amazing athlete. She would be world class on both gymnastics / acrobatics and also horse riding. The moves she does in the books are almost Legola´s style (LOTR movies). Like, when the Rats first meet her they are completely amazed by what she can do on horseback.

And I almost forgot ice skating :)

Truth is book Ciri is a thing of perfect balance / agility / grace / speed. She is almost like a feral cat.

I dont know if Freya was up for the amount of training / stunts she would need to properly portray this. But it would have been quite cool.

And its grounded in lore too. Because she is after all part elf. And her elven blood is supposed to give her a slight physical advantage. Not exactly in size but more in speed / agility / balance.

Also explains why her grandmother was a warrior Queen. And why Ciri could make it at Kaer Morhen.

She has physical abilities which can be used to fight. Its just not about brute force.

And this is also something hollywood often gets wrong and people have misconceptions about. A sword is a pretty light and nimble weapon. Its a very good weapon for a girl. Just needing the proper martial arts training to be like Ciri: fast, nimble. Its never about crossing swords with your enemy. Its all about toying with him, making faint moves, trick him, get an opening and move for the kill.

Could have been interesting to see a female performing like this.

P.S.: If one wants examples, there are some fight scenes with River Tam (Firefly) which embody this. The actress was directed almost like dancing between her enemies.

Taking into account that a lot of shit probably happened between the books and the game and his characted probably developed to some extent it's maybe even too consistent.

You could play the game as Gerald would (for example always chose Ciri, always help Jaskier etc. ).  While reading the Crossroads of Ravens for the first time, that really felt more out-of-line and more like a fan fiction that the game. To clarify, IMO the last book is very complex and it requires multiple readings and really in-depth knowledge of previous books to fully understand it and it's my fauvortie one. So when I play, I think it's the same Geralt, same Ciri, same Yen, Jaskier, same Regis, same everybody, really. I can't think of even one character that was inconsistent. I think amazing is an understatement. I consider the combination of books and Witcher 3 in particular on the same level as Tolkiens work. I know it isn't, but for me it truly is.

I don't think that speaking gently and kindly means the spirit is benevolent, it could just mean that it knows how to appear that way (as Frodo says in LOTR ""a servant of the enemy would seem fairer and feel fouler"").

I think it was warning Geralt to stay away out of self-preservation, not because it was concerned about his safety. It could sense he was a threat.

Once Geralt interacted with the Tree Spirit, it realised it could use him to lift the curse and be freed.

I don't think we have to choose the lesser of two evils. I think we can intend to kill one evil, the Tree Spirit, and then kill the other evil, the Crones, as well.

I think Velen could be a much less depressing place if the Spirit and the Crones were all gone.

Though the comment that the Spirit called the Crones ""sisters"" and not ""daughters"" is a VERY interesting discrepancy - perhaps the most puzzling bit of new info I have yet come across. That is going to be stuck in my brain for a while.

If we look at what happens when the spirit is freed, it does take away Gran's children from the Crones and deposits them at the school in Novigrad, which seems pretty benevolent. But I've never actually been back to Downwarren to see what the Spirit did, so I don't know this - were there children in the village who were killed? Because that kind of defeats the purpose.

Regarding the villagers around the tree - I always think back to what Kiera said had happened when she just arrived in Velen. She had nightmares about something calling her to go into the swamp. When she approached the dream in a lucid state, the presence fled and she had peaceful nights since then. She says this when she and Geralt are talking about the ""witch(es)"" that Ciri is said to have quarrelled with when she arrived in Velen (which we later learn was the Crones).

So we have someone mention being called by a voice in their sleep to enter the swamps, and linking that with the Crones. That could certainly mean the Crones were the ones calling people to walk to the tree in their sleep. 

The alternative is that the Tree Spirit was the one calling Kiera - a possibility, but nothing is nudging us that way, except maybe that Kiera mentions only one voice and not three.

I just feel that if the Tree Spirit really was benevolent, it would've stayed and helped the residents of Velen. They are being crushed under the Crones' oppression, getting precious little in return for worshipping them. But it just fucks off and we don't see it again. I think the idea that the Spirit was one of the Crones who objected to their cruel treatment of the villagers is interesting. But then I imagine it would be more helpful to them once freed.

I get the feeling that the ending of the quest is a bait and switch. We feel good about rescuing the children and it seems like Downwarren's people got what they deserved. But in reality, we released a great and terrible evil on the land, and the deaths of a handful of children would've been minor in comparison to the destruction the Spirit will cause. We just don't know it yet.

This is certainly a very puzzling quest and it's amazing that it still has people talking and debating ten years after this game was released. I really hope we get some continuation of this in W4.

This quest, and ""Where the Cat and Wolf Play"" are two that always leave me wondering if I made the right choice.

&gt;I don't think that speaking gently and kindly means the spirit is benevolent, it could just mean that it knows how to appear that way (as Frodo says in LOTR ""a servant of the enemy would seem fairer and feel fouler"").

I did not claim it was entirely benevolent. But the Spirit's behavior contradict some of the assertions made in ""She Who Knows"" - a mad spirit doesn't talk coherently, and a spirit with a thirst for bloodshed does not complain about spilled blood (op. point 7). 

&gt;I think Velen could be a much less depressing place if the Spirit and the Crones were all gone.

Probably so, but at that point, you don't have a third option: you either help the Crones, or you help the Spirit, otherwise you can't acquire Ciri's whereabouts. 

&gt;The alternative is that the Tree Spirit was the one calling Kiera - a possibility, but nothing is nudging us that way, except maybe that Kiera mentions only one voice and not three.

The Spirit does not live in the swamps - the Hillock is in the forest beyond the swamp, where the Crones have no control over creatures.

&gt;I just feel that if the Tree Spirit really was benevolent, it would've stayed and helped the residents of Velen. They are being crushed under the Crones' oppression, getting precious little in return for worshipping them.

It has just spent a lot of time imprisoned, and it has lost most of its original power as it no longer has a physical body. Perhaps it leaves because it can't stand to fight in its current state, and seeks to restore her power? She does kill all the villagers in Downwarren, which could be a way to relinquish the Crone's control over the general populace - killing the ones that willingly support the Crones. Besides, killing isn't seem as outright evil in the Witcher's game universe. In the game at least, Geralt kills droves of bandits - he doesn't arrest them and bring them to court. So if the spirit is killing people he sees as dangerous and malevolent because they willingly feed the Crones to their own personal gain, possibly at the cost of jeopardizing the entire region, it could amount to something akin to what Geralt does when he goes around killing the bandits who terrorize the population.",3,2026-01-17 14:19:52+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.131875,The Whispering Hillock - why I think the Tree is [SPOILER]

George has had 15 years since the end of Dance with Dragons, 10 years since the end of season 5 (when the series ran out of books to adapt) and 6 years since the end of the series as a whole. 

To put this into perspective, it took Tolkien 17 years to plan, draft and publish the entire LOTR trilogy (including having to deal with WW2). JKR thought of, planned, drafted and published the entire 7 books of Harry Potter in 17 years. CS Lewis took 8 years to do all of the Narnia Books. Rick Riordan finished his first 5 Percy Jackson books in 5 years. Even Stephen King has an average of 1 book (not even counting all the short stories and other stuff he does) in his 50 year career, probably more since he isn't as active any more. In that same space of time, George has struggled to finish one book and keeps on taking on side projects and additional writing because he is painted into a corner.

You cannot place all of the blame at the feet of the showrunners and screenwriters for having to fill in the blanks of his rough manuscripts when George himself couldn't do it for this long. If he was that talented a writer, this would have been complete by now.

The unique flavor that each character has in combat just adds to the fun - using Barret and Aerith feel almost like a different game than Cloud or Tifa.

And it has been... conflictual. Despite them allegedly reading through all the dwarf lore while working the last expansion. In a way they did respect things... by recreating alternate versions of them and showing us how it's supposed to be, when it's done right... while ALSO, allegedly, consciously ignoring important implications for the narrative building of our own dwarves in the very same scenes. Again, like the simple fact one certain trained people are able to ride mythical gryphons... then our own NPC casually mount their own like it's suddently nothing. It's messy, no matter if you're a new player or a veteran.

In another burst of flowing creativity... Blizzard also recreated Rams, but I'd have another word of reconnaissance for those... because they actually seem to be a pure creation of WoW Vanilla !

Ill get downvoted for this, but the 2nd war was a massive clusterfuck with lore, and everything to do with it, and the period between it and the 3rd war when it came to lore seems like blizzard brainstormed ideas, and chose to implement them all. The orcs barely won the first war, yet somehow were a threat to the rest of the continent,  and no one did anything for 6 years about them. Then after getting bodied in the 2nd war, they somehow were able to do multiple smash and grabs across the whole of EK in populated places to get items to eventually accidently break their own planet.

Even when it comes to the dwarves, blizzard sidelined Ironforge as if they wanted to copy erebor being besieged for the whole war of the ring from LotR, and the wild hammers participated in the war as dragon counters. With the dark irons, they ""existed"", then didnt really do much in lore until dagran1 kidnapped Moira,  and we find out the blackrock clan is still around despite how the orcs lost the 2nd war at blackrock. Nefarian using the battle between the 2 sides to his advantage may have hampered efforts to reach out to the dark irons, kidnapping aside, and cataclysm gives the impression they were resistant to siding with the alliance, or at the very least not cause them problems.

It’s power is super ambiguous, and everyone wants it / drawn to it, protagonists and antagonists alike. Everyone that comes into its proximity wants it, and the whole story revolves around it.

It kind of ebbs and flows depending on who is explaining the ring (in the hands of Frodo and Gollum, I’d argue it’s certainly a McGuffin, but in the hands of Sauron, probably not. He however does not handle it in the story, and wants it just the same as the others in the narrative.)

It’s definitely a McGuffin through and through imo. Definitely when it’s in the hands of Frodo (which is where it is for the majority of the story). Infact, it’s probably a definition of one in that context.

Times where the Ring are not a McGuffin would probably be via Saurons history with it.

The One Ring's power isn't just invisibility, it changes based on the desires/ambition of who's wielding it. Frodo, Bilbo and Sam only had the invisiblity from what I remember. There's also the extremely slow aging for Bilbo and Gollum, and potentially anyone else who wields it. 

But if say Gandalf or Saruman or even Galadriel were to wield it, then they would very likely be on par with Sauron during his peak - maybe worse in Galadriel's case. Gandalf even mentions something like that (I mean on what if he were to wield the One Ring when Frodo presents it to him).

The ring also has sentience as it continously tries to tempt it's wielder with visions of how mighty and grand they would be if they were to use it. This is mainly where the addiction to the ring comes from, not from it's power but from the visions. 

It's kinda like how Xal'atath was when she was a knaifu, continously trying to tempt whoever is wielding her and then abandoning them to the next host and so on.

Arguably for something like Frodo or Gollum, it's just an object that has some magical properties.

However, to someone like Sauron, or Saruman, it becomes far more than just an object, it's the power of a ""god"" that can be used for evil.

With someone like Boromir, that would've sealed the deal whether or not it truly was a McGuffin or not - would he suddenly gain magical powers? (I don't think so), or would it corrupt him into thinking Gondor could take on Mordor properly (I think this).

I know Tolkien specifically never went out of his way to explain the powers specifically (I think on purpose). However, the novels do explain the *significance* of the item to the reader and the protagonists, while most McGuffins tend not to, they're just The Special Item^tm

In the end, because of how it's presented and explained in the story, I don't *personally* consider it a McGuffin, because while to Gollum/Frodo/Sam/Bilbo it's just a magic ring, we are explicitly told that in the wrong hands (like Sauron or Saruman) it would be devestating to all who lived in those dark times.

It’s also why LoTR has remained so popular. Tolkien gave the time and care to have something like this that seems so insignificant (it’s a ring) and it kind of starts the adventure that way, but then you come to get to know all about Sauron and it’s creation and what the ring possibly means to him.

[Development notes](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Night_elf#Development)

The night elves were created early on in the development of Warcraft III when the developers were arguing over whether to make dwarves and elves their own standalone playable factions. They could never get the majority of the team to agree to make elves a standalone race until one developer suggested ""dark elves."" The team was enticed by the idea but since they didn't want to do a traditional dark elf race based on the drow from Dungeons &amp; Dragons, they instead took the best of wood elves and dark elves and combined them into a single race, which became the night elves.[283] The developers wanted to stay true to the elf archetype, while adding new ideas to make the concept feel fresh.[284]

The night elves remained heavily based on the drow in early development,[285] at one point being envisioned as jungle-like insect riders.[286] The gender divisions (warrior and ruler women and magically-inclined men), darker-hued skins, and a very powerful goddess are the only elements of this that survive. According to Samwise Didier, many developers within Blizzard were initially skeptical toward the night elves since ""people were used to the Legolas types, the elves that are your typical elves – blondish, brownish hair, while we were going blues and greens and purple."" It took a good picture to help sell the concept, with Didier adding that ""if you have a good picture, you can sell almost anything. If we had a bad picture for it, we probably would have just had wood elves.""[287]

The interesting info to take from this is that we could've had a faction of dwarves but we're now stuck with night elves.",132,2025-12-27 17:19:31+00:00,MEDIUM,2.0,125.98226851851852,How did Blizzard come up with the Night Elves

DK Arthas wasn't in the business of burning libraries, and while there are people who died that held mastery, they'd still have SOME notes - unless we're saying that the High Elves didn't keep any sort of documentation on anything in their world.

So despite losing a ton of people, they've learned to work around that. That's why they have those arcane constructs to do work, they use magic to do work. They're using magic constructs to get materials. They have enough to survive that they have a dedicated Archeology organization to go out and plunder. That alone should tell you that they're not doing terribly right now.

Just because it's the answer people give doesn't mean it's correct.

Why do people think Warhammer before Tolkien? Warhammer is very heavily based on Tolkien anyway. Tolkien is probably **far** more popular with the creators than Warhammer. AFAIK, Metzen doesn't even play Warhammer Fantasy, he plays 40k.

By the time they'd come to WC3 (with Night Elves), they'd been making their own games and nothing to do with Warhammer for 8 years. There are very similar influences, but the similarities are paper thin at most.

Humans in Warcraft have no similarities to humans in Warhammer. At least not when contrasted with literally any other fantasy series. It's more like D&amp;D than Warhammer, but people don't keep saying D&amp;D is the influence.

They also remind me of a bit of eastern european lore I just can't quite remember the name or details of, it's been too long. 

Human warriors are most closely related to the Vrykul/Valajar which are wows vikings that go to Valhalla when they die. 

Human paladins are likened to Knights that serve an order like those of western European tales.

7f6b9d5c-a79d-4981-8601-5e0a29c7026c,1pmjgey,warcraftlore,Any-Transition95,"Agree. While the game has gotten better, the story no longer inspires the same hype and excitement as it used to. Even during the worst expansions, like BfA and SL, I was still intrigued by what was coming next in the story. But after the last patch of SL, I've just felt indifferent.

I'm no stranger to that feeling however. I felt disillusioned with WoW lore when TBC came out, when I realized Blizzard was willing to retcon anything on a whim to fit the gameplay. Characters like Kael'thas, Vashj, Illidan were slapped on as raid bosses with barely any story. Blood Elves and Draenei lore were bent over backwards to make them playable. The grounded fantasy of the Warcraft setting was completely thrown out the window with ugly sci-fi architecture designs, windchime Naarus, Protoss-ified Draenei and their spaceships, magic siphoning pipes, etc. But I've come around enough since then to appreciate WoW's story for what it is, not what I expect it to be. I've learned to enjoy the later expansions separate from my enjoyment of the old Warcraft lore. It's probably why I didn't hate SL as much as most people here, because I still preferred the grounded fantasy setting it had over the ugly sci-fi elements of TBC. The rolling Elysian plains of Bastion, the starry night sky and twilight groves of Ardenweald, the gothic castles and vampires of Revendreth, the Sauron torturers of Torghast and the Maw, etc. Even when the main expansion plot was comically bad, the visuals in SL spoke to me, enough to keep me hooked.

Even if I don't have the same enthusiasm for Warcraft's lore, I still enjoy discussion threads like these because I love observing how players react to the lore/story changes every expansion. I think people tend to overlook how inconsistent the writing quality in WoW has always been, even during the supposedly well-written fan favorite expansions. I think people put Metzen on a pedestal way too much. Wrath was ridiculed at the time for flanderizing Arthas in the leveling zones like a Saturday morning cartoon villain, wasting Azjol'Nerub and Anub'rarak, and cramming in out-of-place sideplots like Malygos and ICC gunship. MoP was mocked for its ""Kung Fu Panda"" theme and cartoon visuals, 180-ing Garrosh into comical villainy, and having half of its story explained outside of the game, leaving many confused with Jaina's heel turn. Legion was lambasted for unceremoniously killing off Vol'jin, corny Valsharrah campaign dialogue, diminishing the importance of lore by handing out Ashbringer like candies, and the over-the-top cosmic plotline in the Antorus raid that has completely derailed the scale of threats in this game since then. These expansions have no shortage of retcons and bad writing, but because the overarching plot of the expansion was an epic experience and the story delivered a satisfying conclusion, most people look back at them fondly.

Meanwhile, expansions that are usually hated for their writing are the ones that didn't stick their landing. Cata wasn't so widely ridiculed until MoP was announced and Dragon Soul came out. Deathwing was touted as a boring edgy one-dimensional villain with a lackluster story and an underwhelming defeat. Most of Thrall's therapy journey in Cata, the sappy conversations between main characters, the edgy one liners from the enemies, and the overall tone of the expansion are exactly what people hated about DF and TWW. People who hated MoP for its themes were excited for the ""metal"" orcs in WoD, but after the horrendous content drought, the random shoehorning of Archimonde, the unceremonious ""Draenor is free"" ending, on top of the convoluted time travel alternate universe plot, the expansion became the worst expansion of all time. By that point, most players have written off post-Wrath WoW lore as completely ruined and unsalvageable. Which is why I find it comical that these days people like to parrot that ""WoW lore was great until Legion"". If it wasn't for Legion's epic conclusion to the Burning Legion's storyline, like Wrath was for Arthas', I doubt people would still be so kind to overlook Cata and WoD for their terrible writing.

They are just are arrogant and xenophobic as they were under Ashara. Tyrande is not a good leader.   
She acts on emotions and is the reason why Blood Elves and Nightborne and not aligned with the Alliance. High Elves get a pass because they are allied with the KirTor and humans.   
  
It is frustrating to see NE player complaining about how the Blood Elves and Nightborne backstabbed the NE ignoring Tyrande and Malfurion made to choice of being enemies. They want to pretend NE are welcoming love hippies that just want peace for the world. They are not. Tyrande is the new cult of personality figure that replaced Ashara.   


Malfurion is better, but is too absent from doing Druid stuff in another plane. (Yes, he is not completely responsible for being away trapped in the Dream for periods against his control).

If it wasn't for game mechanic needs- they would not be part of the Human lead Alliance that fully embraces Arcane. Blizzard has never explored that discrepancy- how NE can overlook Arcane use in Human, Dwarves, and Gnome but completely stonewall other elves after 10,000 years. 

It hard to write them correctly because such a power faction that Blizzard has to nerf their power constantly. With Tyrande and Malfuron on the warfront- Teldrassil should have never been burnt if they were written correctly.  Heck, the Green Dragons should have show up. The ridiculous power up that Sylvanas and Nathanos got to make that story happen it a problem that NE player are right to point out. Elune stopping Tyrande from eliminating Sylvanas was also BS.

It is simple a two prong problem: player perception and Blizzard not embracing their own lore. They finally answer those who want hippy peace loving elves with Amdrassil and that isn't enough. They now want to erase the Blood Elf and Nightborne history so they can have the other ""pretty models"" to serve the NE under the Alliance. 

Tyrande and Maiev murdering NE in their positions of power being hand waved away without a people from NE society is unrealistic.   
Fandral was absolutely right that Tyrande is not a good overall leader even if he would be just a bad. No problem with going evil.  
Jarod was right in the moment of Legion to focus on the bigger picture, but Maiev still should not be welcomed back into leadership circle like nothing ever happened.

Immersion dies when the inner consistency of reality breaks. Early WoW felt like a world with its own history and grounded rules. Now, with the constant cosmic retcons and writing that prioritizes spectacle and the message over logic, that consistency is gone. You stop believing in the world and start seeing the writers' hands pulling the strings. That’s why it feels like a crap show: it’s just a series of events rather than a cohesive place.

Enchantment is a deeper vibe. Tolkien called it Recovery, which is the ability of a story to make you see simple things like a forest or a campfire with a sense of wonder again.

* Warhammer Orcs use shamans, goblins do all the work so Orcs don't need to, squigs, and archers. They ride boars.

* Warcraft humans are a classic fantasy with peasant workers, armoured footmen, knights, catapults, healing clerics, conjurers, elementals, and are a kingdom. Generic fantasy theme.

* Warhammer humans are:
 * Bretonnia: Peasant workers, knights, and a kingdom... but no clerics/summoners/elementals/armoured footmen/catapults.

 * The Empire: Peasant workers (in lore, never in tabletop) and none of the rest. They don't even use catapults. The only thing they have in common is knights.

Warcraft is more similar to *Lord of the Rings* or *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* but people see surface level similarities and a similar name and think they're the same thing.

Void just being shadow expressed different is clearly done to smash in reasoning after the fact, but such rationalization is everywhere for Warcraft from the very beginning.

Actually this is the opposite of what is said. Frostmourne and the helm are the runecarvers greatest creations. They were among the last things pried from his mind. 

The cutscene where primus tells us about it is literally jailer standing over him torturing him then going ""ah yes, finally I have your greatest creations."" 

They are totally unique. So much so primus can't even make another one to help with the scourge and we require recrafting the helm of Dom into the helm of wills. He can't just make some super duper hacks shit with nothing apparently because he had to reuse old materials. 

&gt; cheap franchise instead of original horror

I hate to tell you that most of the scourge (including icc and all that in WoW, which wasn't present in wc3,) is also just a rip off of LotR sauron architecture. It's like a 1:1 copy from the movies. Even arthas armor and helmet look like he's just sauron and he has a blue eye and shit. It's heavily inspired. It was never original. If anything jailers variation on it attempts to make it its own thing rather than thematic theft. 

&gt; 

&gt; you ignoring the gaping voids in the script where entire plotlines simply ceased to exist. 

I'm not. Things can happen and not have an immediate resolution. This is often how blizz foreshadows future events. But in the case where this actually happened it was because of cut content. Korthia for instance had excellent depth and contributed to world building on ptr and all of it got cut on release to retail so now it's a weird half baked zone. This is the case for the devourer as well. 

Besides cut content things (which just get reused later anyway so they're never lost forever,) I'm not sure what you're even referring to. As far as I'm concerned everything that needed to make sense made sense and the issue was navigating to figure it out. I believe that was the issue for SL in terms of things making sense, the delivery method was bad. 

&gt;A cosmos divided will not survive what is to come."" Survive what? It is the laziest trope in fiction...where the villain has no real ideology, only a warning about a bigger, scarier, undefined sequel bait. It renders the entire conflict performative

I want you to read Firim in Exile the next time you think ""what is to come, what does it mean, what did any of it mean,"" because firim was a character whose entire purpose was to act as a stand in for players questioning everything and firim is trying to explain what he can and rationalize what he can't. 

I can save you some time though. It's likely or possible the first ones don't exist anymore and their song of creation already ended. What is happening now is the echos of that song are reverberating. Firim concludes the song can't be allowed to end. In parallel he figures out the 7th cosmic force is at the intersection of the 6 cosmic forces. I'll save you some time speculating on that, it's probably azeroth. The oracle even says ""her dreams sing beneath the surface,"" in zerith mortis. Something nzoth would repeat later. Foreshadowing the setup for TWW and the radiant song 2 expansions in advance. 

I subscribe to a theory that the universe is Azeroths dream, like Azathoth from HP Lovecrafts work. And that the cosmic forces are fighting either to wake her up, destroy her, or keep her asleep. And I think elune is one of her lucid dreaming states and that elunes body is the universe itself like Infinity/Eternity from marvel. 

But that's just speculation or fanfiction in that last paragraph. Everything before that is what happened and what is written or spoken. 

If this is difficult to understand then I highly recommend reading Tolkeins works to understand much of the thematic inspiration for a song of creation or various Lovecraft works with regards to the idea that reality is a dream of an entity that will cause everything to cease to exist when it wakes up. 

&gt;saw Tyrande send him to the Maw, explicitly waiting for Sylvanas,

No. We see tyrande kill him after he brutally beat our asses. His final words are that killing him just returns him to sylvanus. This is what nathanos thought would happen. He also thought this is what sylvanus wanted him to do (it wasn't.) 

It is revealed the jailer is treacherous in many ways because tyrande tells sylvanus she killed nathanos and sylvanus says something about it and jailer is like ""he played his part, he doesn't matter now."" Or some other smug shit. It's actually what makes her turn against him is realizing he not only withheld this information but had withheld, hidden, or possibly obliterated nathanos soul. I actually thought it was good writing because this betrayal and indignity makes sylvanus turn-coat make a lot more sense than anduins boring philosophical lectures and debates. Put yourself in her shoes, you burned every bridge and you think nathanos is leading the scourge to victory on azeroth. You have nobody and blind faith and the belief you'll return to him and right every wrong in the universe. Only to find out, you're a sucker and nathanos has been dead since before you shattered the helm and your boss knew that, didn't tell you, and you can only assume what terrible things have become of your late husband. This makes a lot more sense than Anduin said a bunch of sad words. 

&gt;First Ones and their geometric obsession, yet we still have zero clue who they are, 

We only know what ZM looks like. Reality is a pattern among fractals. Fractals are infinite in scope and change at every depth of viewing. ZM might be very geometric and well tuned or precise but Zerith of Chaos might be totally incomprehensible nonsense. We simply don't know. ZM being the way it is lends itself a lot to this concept of a ""machine of death."" 

We don't know who they are but we know they're very likely dead or nonexistent by the time we've entered ZM. Whether they still are now is a different question. I have a lot of theories about this based in theology and philosophy but this post is already too long. 

&gt;why their perfect design was fragile enough to break just because one bald guy threw a tantrum.

See this is something firim observed. And he wondered why the first ones hadn't implemented safeguards against this happening or why ZM is seemingly incapable of defending itself or anything like that. And he comes to a terrifying realization that reality is not designed to exist forever. 

Firims realizations mirror not only the people thst exiled him but the Jailer himself who is not only privy to all of this information by right of origin and creation, but also has had eternity to ponder the same things Firim has. 

Firim essentially comes to the same conclusion as the jailer in different words: the design is flawed.",2,2025-12-15 12:28:18+00:00,LOW,1.0,81.11767361111112,Can someone make me a good catch-up after a long hiatus ?

The oracle of the first ones hears their songs and interprets what to do from them. Including making afterlives or whatever they will that is in her power to do. 

She also says 

&gt; Her dreams sing beneath the surface. Quiet now, but her voice will awaken the others.

&gt; Mortis. Lumen. Ordus. Rhythm and structure.

&gt; Vitae. Umbra. Tumult. Improvisation and possibility.

&gt; Six voices in discord. Without harmony, the anthem will be ended.

&gt; The cycle has been broken. An eternal song stirs, but the threads must be woven.

These are lines from the Oracle of the First Ones in zerith mortis in SL

&gt; her dreams sing beneath the surface, our dreams, our song 

Nzoth says this in DF

&gt; But the song of the oracle continued to reverberate in my consciousness. And as I allowed my focus to soften, my grip upon the tangible to loosen, the geometry took shape in my mind.

&gt; It was both six AND seven. The six were one, and the seventh the other.

&gt; Did they desire union? The song seemed to say otherwise. Both were, yet only one could be.

&gt; The melody shifted. I shuddered at the shape it took.

&gt; This was not a variable to be solved. It was a solution awaiting its opportunity.

&gt; The song must not be allowed to end.

&gt; Do the First Ones still sing it? Truly, I do not know. But if they do not...

&gt; If they do not...

&gt; Who will?

The six cosmic forces to the first ones aren't demons or titans or anything like how we think of them. They are parts of an Orchestra in discord. And their parts matter like how order is tempo. 

The first ones song of creation borrowed heavily from Tolkeins work as well. Llutvar sang the first song, which created the the lesser gods or angels who created dwarves and things, and together they began to sing the second song. 

I made a longer comment about this. You guys really don't know what you're talking about here. Lifting the name Azeroth from an RPG is a tribute to that name but so is it also named for Azathoth for the second song to keep her asleep and the first song, the one of creation, sung by rhe first ones inspired by Tolkeins creation myth in the lotr universe setting. 

It's so obvious too that for yall to argue against it actually feels profound if not ignorant. 

But think about this. If Saezuruh hears the song of the first ones and it tells her what to do. And she hears the radiant song of our world soul. What does that mean to you? Is it just random to you? Coincidence? Yea the oracle is talking about the radiant song, big whoop, and the oracle hears the song of the first ones who created it. Almost kind of like they are one in rhe same or at least deeply connected. Especially if Azeroths song will supposedly ""waken the others.""

c656153e-e772-49d1-bfdf-7c6dab2c3bc6,1pk76gl,warcraftlore,Karsh14,"They’ve been this way for awhile. People don’t like to hear it, but the snotty arrogant elves were just a “thing” for TBC, and it was resolved at the end of TBC. It was incredibly temporary, and with Midnight coming and it’s makeover of Silvermoon, the snotty elf culture has largely been paved over completely. (TBC Silvermoon still had some relics of that behaviour that will disappear in new Silvermoon)

After TBC concluded, they’ve largely been pretty consistent. It’s why it will always feel weird that they’re still in the horde (until the Horde neutered itself and became lame that is). They share far more in common with their former allies in the alliance (high elves vs humans just feels wrong, even if it’s been almost 20 years since TBC), not to mention geographical alliance would be advantageous for them (but obviously can’t happen for gameplay purposes). A hollowed out Undercity offers them nothing.

Blood elves are functionally just High Elves now (and have been for awhile). They are Blood Elves in name only. As far as I can tell, there’s no distinct difference between High Elf society and Blood Elf society now that TBC is over, and it’s weird they don’t refer to themselves as such. 

If WoW ended for some reason but the franchise continued, i believe they wouldn’t call themselves blood elves anymore, and go back to the High Elf name. (I think so anyways)

For an elf, the events of TBC would be incredibly minuscule in their lives (doubly so since blizzard can’t decide if Elf lifespans are Tolkien or not), so a permanent name change for a civilization full of long lived lifespans seems… forced.",7,2025-12-11 20:19:01+00:00,LOW,1.0,121.67914351851852,How does everyone feel about the direction Blood Elves have been going?

5befb161-80cb-4188-825c-ad7869b5e8d8,1pgibod,warcraftlore,PoopSnorkelLmao,"No..metzens anthology clearly state that the titans are the most powerful beings at the time of the Chronicles writings ans that the void lords covet their power. Because the void lords can't materialize in reality and also can't over power a titan (in the original lore) they resolved to the old god plan. 

Emerging stuff like dimensius being able to hurl planets or jailer overdosing on infinite anima are observable as exceptions to the typical rule as it was originally written. This is part of why the void lords plan is so insidious. If they can't fight the titans they will corrupt a titan and it will devour them and all of existence. Supposedly. 

How you could get a bunch of entities that just want personal power to agree to divide their power to invade worlds to corrupt a planet for the old gods to gain power...well idk. That's actually a good question since the void is not homogenous and lives strictly by the rule that the strong devour the weak so why would a void lord create something bound to be more powerful than itself and likely to devour it if encountered? Lol. We may never know. 

The theory that the titans created the shadowlands simply doesn't work without so many retcons to lore that it would make the shadowlands retcons look like amateur hour for crashing the lore. For instance the SL existed since before the first mortal soul. Thus meaning it was created sometime around the creation of the universe. This is also the period of time supposedly in which the naaru were created and if khadgar is correct and elune created them and that WQ &amp; Elune are sisters created at or around the same time in the same epoch in which naaru were created, then besides all the ways that doesn't make sense with the timeline and conditions for a world soul to awaken, it means the titans created elune which would do more damage to anger the player base than ANYTHING the shadowlands did. 

On top of that Odin said spoke already that the titans and first ones are separate entities. It is unclear how odyn is aware of this and the writers could say that odyn was lied to by the titans but this again just gets more convoluted. I have to assume that Odin bearing a portion of the soul of his creator or maybe some of his memories or orders ability to see the timelines, was able to learn about the first ones but it is unclear. This is perhaps a question better meant for Loken, Helya, or anyone of similar origin and ability that would disregard Odins edicts to never speak of the first ones. 

Everyone wants shadowlands retcons just because they hate jailer/sylvanus but honestly it would be best if the first ones were left as the ambiguous ""what came before the big bang?"" I think firims speculation on the matter was satisfying enough because it implies they don't even exist *anymore.* Which is good enough explanation and could remain a known unknown about the pre-existence of reality. The primordial forces that make up the cosmic forces wove it into existence through song and mathematics and then ceased to exist. 

In fact this concept touches on some very fascinating theological theory in real life. I highly recommend you look up a dissertation called ""is God temporal or timeless?"" I'm atheist but I do find the depth of theory crafting and philosophy to approach this question fascinating. One example of temporarality might be that God came into existence for a second and in that second created everything, heard all the prayers that would happen up to the point of his end of existence, and then ceased to exist. Or that he could be both temporal and timeless in that he always existed as a thing which was utterly disconnected from intelligence or power or form that arranged in such a way for a certain amount of time and materialized and did stuff then dispersed again into disconnected form that might one day, through trillions of years of things happening, be rejoined the same or as something entirely different.

In fact, there is a topic similar to this in scientific thought experiments like the Bratz Brain thought experiment. Which is this concept that if matter collided and had reactions and did stuff over and over forming into new random things it would eventually form a brain that is conscious and sentient and then also cease to exist. This idea of randomly generating things is amusing. You can randomly generate pixels on a screen until it generated Mario for instance. Or randomly type on a type writer until eventually you wrote Shakespeare out of pure randomness. 


For me, in combination with firims speculation, something like this is the best theoretical explanation foe the first ones and never needed to fully explore it beyond that makes them more interesting than defining them. Or else we'll like about the super first ones and the super duper firstest ones before them. Or something disinteresting like that the universe is a simulation as a meta joke on it being a Game by the writers who've hit creative bedrock and can't go any deeper. 

I actually like shadowlands lore. It borrows heavily from HP Lovecraft and Tolkein as well as many real life mythologies. Iirc korthia is based on a babylonian afterlife concept or maybe it was akkadian idr. Where as with the maw you get a very modern depiction of hell as this place of endless inescapable torture but in revendreth you get a very sort of Milton-y hell that is wrought with sin and decadence and the craving for power. And maldraxus is a lot like the bad place warriors go in Norse (maybe Danish actually) mythology where they just fight forever and despite deteriorating and rotting, despite being killed over and over, they never die. 

Bastion is like a mix between a typical heaven setting and the Greek concept of elysian fields among other things. 

I could type all day about this. There's quite a bit to appreciate. Jailer himself could have been interesting if he was fleshed out for longer, delivered better, didn't impact Arthas/scourge story or do the puppet mastering of the legion, and just stuck to what he actually is. A deity that rebelled against his pantheon to be bound in chain and cast out of the realms of the gods into a timeless void. You know, exactly like Morgoth in lord of the rings. Also they should have just let tyrande kill sylvanus. That will mever not have been the right decision imo. 

Retcon of the first ones to be the titans would be unbearably painful. The hoops to jump through just to make the chronology of it work require rewriting the history of wow in a way that would displease people even more than shadowlands.

I've always found it quite odd that Dwarfs in wow don't have any sort of enmity with dragons in particular, as far as I can tell. Very different from Tolkien and Warhammer, Warcraft's main inspirations. Dragons were clearly known of, as there's a Red dragon's Skeleton in Ironforge (I should hope they give that back at some point, rather rude).

According to the oracle the purpose of demons, fel, chaos isn't the evil nature we think of it as. Rather the first ones created demons with the label of improvisation and possibility. Order would stagnate but demons/chaos give order something to do to require innovation. Except the titans figured out killing them didn't work and didn't bother with rehabilitation or any of that nonsense, they imprisoned all of them they could find in Marduum. A prison world in the twisting nether. This meant the check to their power was uninhibited. 

This actually better gives cause to why turning sargeras to chaos/fel and freeing the demons was necessary. Otherwise it doesn't make like any sense. 

It is possible also that the titans themselves were meant to be diverse and not exclusively Order. Eonar for instance is a nature titan. And perhaps not the cosmic forces but their titan embodiment are meant to sing the next song. 

The reason I think this is also possible (though not a part of my original theory,) is that the world souls are known to sing songs. The radiant song of Karesh, Argus, and Azeroth is one of pain or suffering. Amanthul went around forcefully converting them all to arcane/order. I assume eonar is different because he arrived too late to completely convert her to order or maybe she was order but somehow adjoined herself with life at some point. Idk. But it might make sense then why denathrius and jailer are trying to turn the titans to various cosmic alignments. 

For instance, the dreadlords helping void lords to devour or corrupt a world soul (void titan,) is what causes sargeras to snap and become a demon/fel titan, and then the dread lords attempt to turn Argus into a death titan. And eonar of course is a nature titan. 

Why do I think maybe Azeroth is a first one or if she isn't that the titans are order corrupted to prevent the next song from being sung? That would take way too long to explain. 

But know that Saezurah, oracle of the first ones, said this

&gt; her dreams sing beneath the surface. Quiet now, but her voice will awaken the others 

Know this 

&gt; her dreams sing beneath the surface, our dreams, our song 

- nzoth

Know that the nerubians use harmonizing instruments to attune themselves to the song of the world in order to leave the unseeming. 

&gt; with many eyes they will see again, they will drink and be uplifted 

- nzoth 

Orweyna and the harranir try and fail to save the great roots of the world tree that have drank the black blood. Those lost in the unseeming bare the titles of discordant and forgotten. The discordant are those wondering the unseeming while the forgotten are those that have died within it. They are not in harmony with the world's song and they are not a part of her memories. Hanan refers to this as dissonance and that he cannot see or think but after more exposure he sees only horrors. Orweyna describes this as a suffocating darkness. What effect the blood has precisely on the roots is unclear but it is dangerous to them and we find a root ancient sapling completely corrupted at the base of one root. 

&gt; deeper, deeper it's roots will reach, welcoming our embrace 

- Nzoth 


Her dreams sing beneath the surface. They will ""wake the others."" These dreams, supposedly shared by the old gods, supposedly shaped into the emerald dream by Eonar/freya, probably the means by which nyalotha (a dream) exists, the nightmare. Etc. And the song she sings which the old gods, titans, jailer, etc., all want to stop from happening. It seems like the titan machinery is suppose to keep her asleep to me personally.

But most curious, and what I hope you'll spend some time thinking about: 

 The jailer intended to steal her soul or power to reprogram reality. And it worked. Azeroths world soul was capable of powering the Sepulcher of the First Ones in zerith mortis and allowed him to link together all the zerith instillation for the purpose of rewriting reality. 

But that should make you wonder, shouldn't it, why Azeroth specifically is able to activate the first ones machinery. The maw walker is able to leave the maw and use first ones machinery because the heart of azeroth gives them a special bond with the world soul. These are things the eternal ones like jailer and the titans and naaru are not only forbidden to do, but incapable of doing. Makes you think she probably is one. 

You may also want to read about Azathoth from HP Lovecraft for a deeper look into the inspiration for wow. Azathoth is the creator of all things who created all the deities in the universe and then rested. The lesser deities play music to keep him asleep and all of reality is his dream. Seems quite possibly related considering eyes of the earth mother says Azeroth created Elune and Anshe and Losho (winter queen.) And from them Elune created the Naaru and possibly the wild gods. 

And on top of that, Nzoth is obsessed with this saying he repeats over and over 

&gt; All eyes will be opened. 

But now. I want you to remember what I said about the 6 cosmic forces singing the next song and giving up their power to be joined by a 7th and how they don't want to do that. Tolkeins origin myth for the LOTR universe is that ragnarok has to happen and then after the evil angel is defeated the angels and mortals will join in singing the next song of creation. And in Lovecraft work (primary inspiration for the old gods, void, chaos, in wow) it is said the lesser gods make music to keep Azathoth asleep. 

If you follow their inspirations to the final conclusion it sounds as though the 6 forces either want to keep Azeroth asleep or wake her up. Keeping her asleep means the status quo resumes as it is. Waking her up means convincing the cosmic forces to come together. You can see in that context why the Titans don't want that to happen. They are the rulers of the material universe and enjoy such luxury that is exploitative or exclusive of the others. The elemental planes are a prison for the elements, the veil separating life and death is like a one way mirror to keep death proper sealed away, it seems like *maybe* Elune and nature are in bed with the titans, it seems like Elune created the naaru to control the light or for it to fight the void, and the titans created an entire prison dimension to put demons on for all eternity. 


I can ramble forever. My original theory is that the 6 forces must sing together in harmony to create the 7th force but they refuse to. The first ones song that makes up our reality is just an echo. It doesn't go forever. What is to come? What is to come? WHAT is to come? Is the end of that song or the echos of it. That is why Zovaals work sought to do what was necessary to disrupt the monopoly of power but he was unsuccessful and went foe the nuclear option the second time around. The titans will not cede their power and will let the universe stagnate and die to hold onto their power.",1,2025-11-23 10:42:12+00:00,LOW,1.0,81.11767361111112,Your Midnight + TLT crackpot theory

The Horde in particular was really a good anti-hero faction in my opinion, with some anti-villains in there as well. The Alliance, well I don't like how the Alliance was handled since WotLK. I feel like the devs wanted to make them too much like the LotR ""Free Peoples"" with the typical Human-Elf-Dwarves tropes attached instead of developing towards something more unique. Now it is arguebly much worse with the Marvelization of the franchise. 

Cosmic forces as this weird Yin-Yang thing seems odd. Especially since it goes against what we as players experienced like 90% of the time. Also it is a fundamental misunderstanding of Yin-Yang, but whatever faux-eastern esoterics bullshit goes hard since forever. 
&gt; Why have they made magic so boring? 

I find this kind of thing interesting, because it is a typical example of explaining something to death. Really in past Warcraft games magic was kinda random. Yeah there was arcane and chaos/fel and nature and stuff, but it kinda overlapped already, but in ways that was left unexplained. By trying to force one coherend cosmology, the world seems to have become smaller in scope and trying to define each cosmic force, actually made them look more similar than distinct. 
&gt; I mean I still laugh when I think how CALIA WAS RESSURECTED INTO UNDEATH BY THE LIGHT and how the person responsible for that did not stop to look just how stupid it sounds.

It seems like people increasingly want to tell Marvel-like stories where special characters act like superheros and not faction leaders. Generally factions are made very bland. With weird ""councils"" everywhere and weird appeal to ""modern democratic values"" or something. Idk how else to describe what the councils are and why they appear everywhere. 

The change of scope from regional and faction conflicts to ""for Azeroth"" makes it also much harder to tell small stories. Somehow something that has been forgotten. Why does everything need to be some super-duper existential threat anyway? Looking back, what I found the most interesting about vanilla is how there is no real one central conflict around. There are many, plus the faction war and so on, but there is no one-sided big conflict. With each expansion it seems to have become more pidgeonholed in that regard. Vanilla was in a lot of ways more *horizontal* in that every zone had its own story, though several zones culminated into each other, like the big Defias storyline. Though also the Defias weren't an existential threat ""for Azeroth"", but a local conflict against Stormwind that tangled up into other conflicts like Onyxia, but still somewhat independent of it. It is a better way to connect small and large conflicts in my opinion rather than to present us with cosmic powers battling each other. It is also why Shadowlands simply didn't work, because the Jailor was just too much one-up-manship in regards to villain levels. 
&gt; I just want an expansion where the Alliance identity, history, and perspective aren’t diluted in favor of a blanket “we’re all friends forever” narrative. 

Frankly the Alliance identity had been handled badly since WotLK in my opinion. Not fully, but even the transition from Wc3 to Vanilla was weird. The Alliance clearly isn't some LotR-esque ""Free Peoples"" factions, but it seems like that was exactly the impression they wanted to have with the lore changes to the Night Elves in particular. Somehow I also never really cared about both Anduin and Varian. Idk why exactly. 
&gt; That doesn’t mean we need another full-scale faction war, but pretending the Alliance and Horde are suddenly best friends ignores decades of storytelling 

I mean it was never really consistent was it? Again from Wc3 onwards it regularly repeats itself. The two factions start as enemies, then a really huge threat (Archimonde, Arthas, Deathwing etc.) comes along, they unite to defeat that enemy and then their relation sours again, rinse and repeat for every expansion. It is narratively weird that two factions are constantly in conflict if their leaders are actually friends with each other. Jaina and Thrall were allies, same with Malfurion, Tyrande and Kael in TFT. Now apparently Thrall and Anduin are also on good terms. Apart from Garrosh and Sylvanas, the leaders of each faction seem like a troupe of superheroes instead of *faction leaders*. Hence why side stories are so important.

But yeah, it does seem like Anasterian gets a bad rap, especially in the Slyvanas novel where he’s portrayed way more negatively than Tides of Darkness. At least blood of the Highbourne and Arthas Rise of the Lich King showed some good qualities of the guy.  But yeah, I think the Skyvanas novel while a pretty good book really did pay him in more negatively then it didn’t have to. Granted most of the book is from Slyvanas POV  so it makes sense to have some biases against him but still, we shouldn’t take that as the entire reflection of the character since we don’t have Anastarian’s POV. 

Ultimately, I wish the lore had shown some if not more redeeming qualities for Anastarian yes he’s a jerk but that doesn’t mean he was a bad king after all he reign for about 3,000 years while the second and third war are just specific slices of his entire reign albeit important ones given, they take place at the end of his life.

One observation: I've noticed a slight discrepancy in the counting of human years with the official chronology. Still, if Stormwind emerged 1,200 years ago, that means they considered starting to count the years in 608 years from its founding. That was eight years after Magna Aegwyn's voluntary seclusion.

The wiki says: *Aegwynn decides to remain Warden of Tirisfal indefinitely, in part due to her concern about the Tirisfal Council's meddling in the politics of different nations.*

I found this interesting. I was wondering what happened 592 years ago that caused humans to start a calendar? Perhaps it was due to the influence of the Tirisfal Council.

On another note: the Muslims invaded the peninsula in 711 AD. The occupation ended in 1492 with the capture of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs. That's **781** years. That year is considered the end of the Middle Ages, which began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476. The Middle Ages therefore lasted **1,016** years.

Bilbo is brought back to life in the second chapter. Aragorn mopes around having lost faith in his ranger abilities. Frodo and Sam clear out the barrow downs but the barrow wights teleport to another planet and eat a god so they still win in the end. At no point is a fellowship formed. The ring is never addressed.

So yeah, it kind of reinforced the idea that the shadow council is supposed to be a secret warlock well running the Old Horde in the shadows not say a Orcish version of the  Bohemian Grove that includes Chieftains like Kargath. 

Oh yeah, what are the things I find both fascinating about Warcraft lore despite it’s numerous retcons some that are bad like Shadowlands but also you have retcons that I feel makes sense  such as Kargath membership of the shadow council because like I said, I don’t think it fits his character to have him be part of the council hence why I’m kind of glad that they retcon this detail out. Plus when i used old lore like Rise of the Horde despite some the details are changed for Chronicles 2 i could still use rise of the horde for say Durotan Since the book is his personal perspective as the main character of the book. While I used Chronicles 2 for the same events and the timeline kinda like how Tolkien scholars handled 
Galadriel history as told from Unfinished tales and compared that to the silmarillion.

It also fascinated to see how the lore evolves over the years for an example it was clear that Kargath and Kilrogg were meant to play a roll into Thrall’s New Horde (such as Adventures and Warcraft 3 reign of chaos manual.) before the burning crusade change that. To be honest, I’m not sure how I feel on one hand. It would be fascinating to see how Kargath and Kilrogg navigate once they joined Thrall’s new horde maybe the rules could be similar to Eitrigg.

But at the same time, I’m also don’t mind their canonical fate that we currently have like Kilrogg’s duel and death at the hands of Danath Trollbane from the novelization of Beyond the Dark Portal what’s such an awesome moment in the book. While I also like how Kargath fate in the burning Crusade being a similar to Grom when he became a fel horde and establishing  the Fel Horde granted the burning Crusade has a lot of problems with its lore but I don’t think Kargath’s fate in fact I think it works thematically whereas Grom despite becoming a fel orc at least found his redemption and free his people from the service of the burning Legion.

And not all of the elves in the West speak it unless they have a lot to do with Men (including Hobbits). It’s why Haldir is the only elf that speaks to them when they try to enter into Lothlorien.

It would be interesting and play into first ones lore though. The first ones are strongly inspired by Tolkiens works specifically the Vala. The oracle in zerith mortis heart the song or creation and from it interprets the will of the first ones. This is similar to how Eru Llutvar (the prime creator of everything deity) created Vala and others to sing a song which brought into being the lands and world and set forth destiny of events.

And since Azeroth is closely tied to creation and free will it plays in well to this inspiration of Tolkiens creation myth/story. I won't go too into detail but the first song had problems then melkor sewed discord into the second song which is why everything's fucked up basically. The jailer is a lot like melkor in wanting to claim creation for himself and believing he could fix the music or make it better.  Melkor lost a fight for dominance over middle earth and as a result he was bound in chain and thrown out of the universe into the timeless void through the window of stars. Suspended there by the chain. But prophecy dictates that at the end of the second song he will return and cause ragnarok but then be defeated. The result of his defeat will usher in the second song wherein mortals will join in, in singing and see the world remade in perfection. Thus the return of melkor marks a doomsday ragnarok or revelations type end of the world prophecy. 

And if you read all of that then it should make sense more now why the story of the shadowlands and of tolkiens world are so closely related in themes. 

But my point is that in that context, it is possible that if it is Azeroths song then perhaps we they will continue this thread and her song would mark a new age in which the world is renewed and bliss or happiness comes about. This may well be why the titans would prefer she stay asleep forever or at least until she is changed to their side.",2,2025-10-15 12:41:30+00:00,LOW,1.0,81.11767361111112,We can actually hear the Radiant Song throughout Worldsoul Saga

This was like the very early 2000s, before we had common sense about connecting with people online the way that most do now, so I had no idea I was basically catfishing this person (it wasn’t romantic, and there were never any talks of meeting up or connecting past our online chat, but still). 

Imo, rping as another gender is a really great way to explore your gender when you’re not sure that’s something you’re ready to bring into full reality yet. You might learn things about yourself lol 🤷‍♂️😅. 

Boy oh boy oh boy do I ever miss the really old MSN roleplay chatrooms 😭. I would not be who I am today without those. This would have been almost *exactly* what you are looking for. But back then most of the rp chatrooms were based on a franchise or basic fantasy world. There was HP, LOTR, X-men, etc, and basic fantasy where I had a shapeshifter OC (also my X-men OC lol), it’s outdated for uhhh reasons obvs lol but I used to rp as Lupin from HP as well. But you could probably find some real life esque rp rooms there too. Unfortunately this site closed a million years ago. 

Maybe try googling like “any roleplay chat room sites similar to the old MSN chatroom site” and see if anything similar comes up. 

For a similar experience you could do things like anonymous chat sites (Omegle chat only version (not the video version) or whatever), or roleplay bots, or something, where you chat as real world based alter ego, but these will almost always be one on one.

Edit: if you don’t mind it also coming with a visual aspect, you could check out furcadia. It comes with a download though of a sort of “game,” but it’s less a game and more a social chatting thing. There is a lot of rp on there, but I have no idea if people there are rping as their actual visual characters in it (basically look like furries lol), or as real world personas. I think majority of the people on there are *not* actually furries irl, despite what the game art and character design might have you think lol. But it has been many many many years since I was on this, so I have no idea what it’s like now days.

There are also lots of virtual world “games” (but that are more social, rather than actually a game) as downloads and as browser based, where you can have a visual character and make them any gender you want and have them present however you want, and then chat with people.",1,2026-01-26 23:29:43+00:00,LOW,2.0,279.9221064814815,Is there something wrong with this idea or question?

What they’ve done to Star Trek with “Starfleet Academy” reminds me of what Prime did to “Lord of the Rings” with “The Rings of Power”. 

It’s like a desecration, replacing something compelling with drivel. Worse, bad drivel. 

Avid long term Star Trek fan here. I watched the original series as a kid and loved it when it first came out. And have had varying opinions on the different iterations.

Now, while this “iteration” under Kurtzman has only just been released, and who knows, maybe it gets …”better” (somehow - but surely you’d put effort into the FIRST episode wouldn’t you?) - I have to agree, what I’ve seen so far is awful.

I’ve heard the term zombie franchise used - where all the great things that went into something that was great, has gone - and something completely different inhabits it trying to leverage that audience. 

Perhaps it’s because Starfleet Academy is aimed at a very different demographic to what many of the “fanbase” of the past grew to love. 

Maybe they don’t want to engage the established audiences?

Maybe it’s because they hired people with myopia, who can’t write, or create, and not get tied up in trivia and clichés.  

Star Trek was a watershed show in its day and broke new ground, despite its limitations and compared to today’s budgets and technology, had to leverage much more modest and rudimentary production approaches. 

What I’ve seen so far I found not only uninspiring, but insipid. Like a wilted lettuce leaf. And all the flashy effects can’t disguise poor storytelling and weird plot lines that don’t deliver.

Ok. So, maybe we should reserve judgment. But if it’s anything like “The Rings of Power”, it’s just going to confirm my first impressions. We shall see.",2,2026-01-21 19:48:29+00:00,LOW,2.0,0.04931712962962963,What's going on with all the hate for Star Trek: Starfleet Academy?

Generally the races will be the same across systems because of how fantasy TTRPGs use the same sources of origin. 

Forgotten Realms gods also just don’t do anything. They’re real but apathetic.

If you don’t think Paizo deities do anything you have SEVERELY missed the plot. The reason the Angel mythic path works the way it does is because Iomedae ascended to godhood and is throwing her weight around.

Cayden Cailean, the god of freedom and drink, is another one who ascended from mortality to godhood. 

Desna literally pops in and alters the map with the Azata court, and she shuffles the entire Abyssal hierarchy by touching succubi and other evil-aligned beings with her blessings. 

The Swarm That Walks becomes so powerful that it can threaten the entire pantheon and become a god itself.

I was just looking for more information about C. S. Lewis, and I found this link from the Museum of the Bible: [C. S. Lewis and the Myth That Became Fact](https://www.museumofthebible.org/magazine/exhibitions/c-s-lewis-and-the-myth-that-became-fact).  It has a short video that talks about how Lewis initially thought Christianity was only another myth, just like pagan myths.  But through the influence of his Christian friends, he gradually became convinced that it was true.  He later wrote, ""When Christ took on flesh, myth became fact.""

Some of them can have meaning and guide me in my life, but I don´t take them at face value. And you need to think, it´s like astrology or Nostradamus. All those ""prophecies"" are written in a way that they make sense for everyone, in every year, in every situation. They read about how in January the planets spin a certain way and how this influences their decisionmaking and making them more able to change, and they think to themselves: ah yeah, that´s SO TRUE, this is exactly what is happening in my life!"" But it´s actually written a way that most people can relate to. So they believe it. That´s the bible/other religious works. Things happened, people talked to people, some wrote them down, changed them to fit their own beliefs, changed them to fit the beliefs in that time period, and then it started to spread. People were forced to change their beliefs, from celebrating nature and humanity to rules and punishments and so on.

So yeah. In a way, you will find salvation trough grace. If you live a peaceful life, forgive people that wronged you and move on, change your ways and follow a certain set of rules that prohibit bad things then you life will be better. You will feel better because it´s a way out of this mess. If you talk again with your brother that left you 10 years ago and did horrible things- I can garuantee you you will feel at peace when you talked to him again and moved on. This works without the bible too. It´s a guide to make your life better. You can achieve this with many other things, chistianity works too, but just be careful because religions are full of people that think they are right and do horrible things because their god supports them. Today still.

Oh and just remember- it is just belief. People don´t have proof, it makes sense in their belief system, in their story, if you will. It makes sense in context, but if you look at it like it´s a story, then you know it´s only making sense story wise. It´s like I´m talking about Lord of the rings. If I explain the story and the reasons and the deeper meaning- it all makes sense in that universe. And maybe I can relate to that and learn from it and understand.

If Eru is not the One, then explain why the Earth is round today when throughout history all cultures knew it was flat. Obviously it was rounded after the [Númenoreans](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/N%C3%BAmenor) attacked the Undying Lands, after which the Earth [was made round so that only the Elves can find the straight path](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Changing_of_the_World) when they leave the confines of the Earth. Checkmate, atheists!

As a fundamentalist believer in [Eru Ilúvatar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Il%C3%BAvatar), here is the list:

* [Ainur](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ainur): The offspring of Eru Ilúvatar's thought, whose music created the realm of [Arda](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arda) which we now inhabit. The Ainur are grouped into the Valar and the Maiar.
* [Elves](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elves), the firstborn children of Ilúvatar. You will not see them in modern day because following the destruction of the one ring they sailed the ""[straight road](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Straight_Road)"" (i.e. not on the surface of the planet) to the undying land.
* [Dwarves](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves): Created by [Aulë](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Aul%C3%AB) the smith of the Valar. In his eagerness and anticipation for the children of Ilúvatar to awaken, he crafted the dwarves deep under the ground, but they were automatons with no free will or soul. When he realized this he wanted to destroy his creation, but Eru Ilúvatar granted them life from the flame imperishable. The dwarves are beyond the reach of mortal men, having dug too deep and are not seen by us.
* [Ents](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ents): As the dwarves came to life and gnawed on the roots of the trees, [Yavanna](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Yavanna), the queen of the Earth, asked for her creation, the plants and forest to be protected. This is how the Ents became the shepherds of the forest. Unfortunately the Ent wives and Ent men have drifted apart so that no Entlings were born, and many of them became more tree-ish over the centuries. That's why we cannot see them today.
* [Orcs](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Orcs): [Melkor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Morgoth), also known as Morgoth, tortured and enslaved Elves, breaking their soul and corrupting their minds to create orcs. They served Melkor after Melkor was cast out into the void beyond the circle of the world they followed Sauron. After Sauron's defeat many went mad and killed themselves, others were hunted and killed by the free folks of the world.
* [Dragons](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dragons): [Melkor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Morgoth) also created dragons, though what magic he used to bring forth those creatures is unknown, though it is suspected that he used a fragment of his own soul to create them. The dragons first appeared in [Dagor Bragollach](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dagor_Bragollach), the Battle of Sudden Flame, and the last of the dragons, Smaug, was slain by Bard of Laketown.
* [Balrogs](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Balrogs): Balrogs are Maiar who served Morgoth. Following the War of Wrath they were slain or went into hiding deep within the Earth. The last Balrog was encountered in Khazard-dum in the year 3019 of the Third Age.

Here's an exercise I do with myself sometimes. I make two lists.

Here's a small list of major characters whose deaths were the results of betrayals by lovers:  
\- Samson &amp; Delilah  
\- The Mummy Returns: &gt;!Imhotep, left to die by his lover Anck Su-namun!&lt;  
\- Game of Thrones: &gt;!Daenerys, stabbed by Jon Snow, also Tyron strangles Shae!&lt;  
\- Star Wars: &gt;!Padme Amidala, killed by Anakin!&lt;

Think about how their deaths served their own arcs and the arcs of their betrayers. How would the story be different if they had happy endings?

Becoming mortal to live and die with your lover:  
\- Disney's&gt;!Hercules and Megara!&lt;  
\- &gt;!Arwen and Aragorn!&lt; in LotR  
\- &gt;!Damon and Elena!&lt; in Vampire Diaries  
\- Circe and Telemachus

Why is this the best ending for these characters and their story? How does it fit into their arcs? How would things be different if their stories ended in betrayal instead?

Now imagine both endings for your characters. Maybe even compare them to couples on this list. Which ending better suits their arcs and the tone and message of the story? Why?",1,2026-01-27 03:32:05+00:00,LOW,1.0,18.932881944444443,What type of ending is better

I will say that my main fandom is Lord of the Rings so I have been extremely fortunate that the LOTR community has always been extremely prolific. that is kinda wild considering the books were published in the 1950s, and most stories I encounter are clearly book-based/written by a book-reader as opposed to someone who is only a fan of the movies. my OTP are literally only mentioned in a footnote as being together after the books end, but that pairing still has thousands of stories (&amp; still actively being published ones). your post definitely made me feel very lucky about that, because I too worry about the day when my fandom/pairing runs dry. 

my advice to you here is to do two things:   
1. don't write fanfic with your happiness hinging on hits/reviews of the work. that will take away joy from something you love. I promise you there are other people your age and older still discovering fanfic or joining the fandom, so just imagine how excited they'll be to stumble across your stories one day. I am currently reading a bunch of fics on an oldddd forum that a specific writer wrote in 2002 and I can't help but wonder what she's up to these days. I feel so grateful she wrote such beautiful stories! publish and don't keep checking hits :) you will be happier!   
2. consider what other fandoms you might be interested in reading (or writing) about! I have gone through periods of time where I pop back into old fandoms I used to love and I am so siked to see a bunch of fresh (to me) works! I recently looked up Queen fanfics (pls don't ask lol) and was utterly baffled that a bunch of 19/20 year old girls are writing Roger Taylor fanfics in 2026... and here I was feeling like a weirdo for lusting after a 70 year old man at my age! haha :) like I said, there's always new people discovering old fandoms! scan your bookshelf or think of favorite movies/shows you love and consider sprinkling in some reading from those too. 

again, so sorry to hear you're feeling down about it. I get it. but I also feel so validated anytime I come across a teenager who reads/writes fanfic and they think its so cool I've been doing it for so long. they always get excited and say they hope they're into this at my age too. you're never too old :)",4,2026-01-26 06:22:56+00:00,LOW,1.0,0.0,Have I grown too old for fanfics?

Like, I LOVE Lord of the Rings. I've read it fully through twice, watched the movies countless times, the extended editions with the commentary and documentaries, read The Hobbit at least 10 times, used the movie soundtrack in my wedding. Similar with Star Wars, Dr Who, Outlander, Princess Bride, ER, Grey's (though honestly, got so bored of that a few seasons ago and dropped it), Downton Abbey, Call the Midwife, She-Ra, and Game of Thrones (well, I until the last season...). I have seen every episode or movie, read the books, etc., but don't write or read fanfiction for any of it.

For me, the thing that sparks the fanfiction and greater fandom interest is when the canon material gets something so *wrong* that I need to see it done right. Usually, that's a ship that didn't go canon or the wrong characters did, but it could also be a character death, a series cancelation on a cliffhanger, or just totally wasted potential.

d4d4cc26-3a0e-41cd-b9d9-c54f533cff4e,1qmgbza,FanFiction,hwate8,"**Multicross**: Age of Empires 1, Game of Thrones, AoE2/4, ?/?, AoE3, Familiar of Zero, etc

I'm planning out a fic where the main character has RTS!Gamer powers, effectively being the birds-eye-view player of an RTS game and being sent to settings in ascending order of an associated RTS 'power levels' (including Dune, Warcraft 3, and capping around Warhammer 40K's power levels, etc). Their first setting, Game of Thrones, starts with an Age of Empires' Town Center and three Villagers, from which they gather resources, create more military and naval Units, construct Buildings to produce them, and have a limited 'Population Cap' of 500 Units (which is accurate to the game and prevents them from overrunning any army through sheer numbers).

In the case of games that have *real-life* plots (like most of the Age of Empires series) or have plots that *acknowledge* their RTS mechanics as in-universe realities (like Supreme Commander and Total Annihilation, also at the peak of power levels), I want them to be placed in other settings that feature Army-vs-Army battles.

Unfortunately, these are surprisingly rare. **Planetos** is a godsend for pre-gunpowder tech around the level of **AoE1** (peak of the Roman Empire, \~400AD), but **finding a comparison for AoE2/4** (very similar time periods, capping somewhere between 1300AD with Chinese Hand Cannoneers to 1600AD Korean Turtle Ships, and the addition of Bombard Towers/Cannons/Galleons that all use cannonballs) **is really damn hard, since it's in that period where gunpowder was being introduced to warfare but they hadn't quite reached Muskets like in AoE3,** which I've reserved **Familiar of Zero** for as a fitting 'equivalent'.

The best suggestions I've had thus far for the middle two are: **Avatar the Last Airbender** (unorthodox, but not a bad starting point), **Lord of the Rings** (pre-gunpowder, not sure if the local magic/mages would make up for it), **RWBY** (good for another RTS, but it needs to be higher-tech to compete with the locals, and it needs a way to generate resources renewably because of the way Grimm can likewise be respawned indefinitely), **Warhammer Fantasy** (which already has it's own Total War game so it's already reserved for it's own 'midgame' section of the story), **various unnamed Zombie franchises** (which isn't really the tone I was looking for but I might consider it especially if I add something like Minecraft Legends into the mix), and in no particular order, **Final Fantasy Tactics, Dragon Age, Fable, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the Witcher** (which all require research).

Does anyone want to point at any of the listed examples as a good match, or make some recommendations of their own (Anime/Manga/Manhua/etc are fine, I just haven't been given any ideas yet) that would make for a 'fair fight' against an enemy that treats Hand Cannoneers like somewhat-inaccurate Archers with high firepower?

FF XIII — Paddra Nsu-Yeul/Life and living out a happy existence as long as possible. 

I can recall a lot about this one since it had such a bizarre and specific premise. I recall that it was Yeul who Caius places in the water during the opening scene of XIII-2 (not Noel's Yeul), and in this AU fanfic, I remember her somehow crossing over into Arda and the world of Lord of the Rings. Instead of properly reincarnating, she ended up elsewhere due to a deviation and lost her foresight. I remember her hanging out with Elrond and Gandalf in Rivendell while she tried to uncover what happened to her link with Etro. Since she retained memories from before death, it felt incorrect being there; her soul should have reincarnated but got misplaced for some reason. Andover whether the goddess had intended for her to be there, I do remember it was the intention of Etro that she wind up in Arda but not why, meanwhile Elrond and Gandalf have no idea what Etro even is, since arda has a different god and origin etc, so Elrond and Rivendell are just like ‘Who is this?? 'How did she find her way in here?' As I said she had no power, but the crystal in her chest from memory was still present; it had merely dulled and become lifeless without any magic. My main focus was on what her longer life would mean and be like for her over there. In the end, she does get reincarnated, wrapping up the loop and ushering in the next Yeul into the cycle. I feel like younger me just wanted the character to have more time and enjoy life outside of the seeress role and away from Caius and his issues too. Since Gandalf and Elrond are kind souls, I decided to pair her with them to help solve the mystery. The twins were involved, Glorfindel showed up, and Arwen was in the mix as well. Pretty much the Rivendell gang, plus Gandalf and one random final fantasy character. That’s pretty much all I remember. 

FFVII - My only other extensive and completed fic changed up the historical setting of Wutai quite a significantly. It started out as a much bigger settlement only to  have some serious issues that led to it splitting into two  different clans, one continuing to be  Wutai and the other forming a separate thing entirely, which eventually ended up in a war against one another. Things escalated, resulting in severe injuries and the deaths of main characters. I recall this one much less clearly. Whenever I wrote about anything in a fictional setting it was mostly about h

FF VIII — I left this one unfinished, but I started crafting a fic about Ultimecia's time and her descent into villainy. Imagine existence in a future with high-tech cities, where seed and garden are all upgraded and gadgets rule the day. Witches? If you observe people closely enough, you can catch them, and in the present day of FFVIII, their powers can also be suppressed using Odine bracelets. Rinoa aimed for that at the end of disc 1. Imagine that advancements in technology are taking place as well. Think about how being in a world where everyone fears witches might push someone towards evil, since history keeps a glaring record of your apparent future ascent to power. From an early age, being immersed in these circumstances, coupled with the legacy of your powers and facing isolation, can significantly impact your life in a untold ways and may lead someone to the brink. It doesn't mean that Ultimecia isn't a villain—she is—or that she didn't bring her demise upon herself because she did. Nor is she excused for all the suffering and deaths she causes. I really wish Final Fantasy VIII had delved into the reality of living in a future like that and beyond today's technology for a witch trying to remain hidden until she snaps and decides ‘Okay, I’m killing everything and becoming a god in a form of existence only I can survive in.’ Usually a descent like that is a process. I'm just intrigued by what that process version of the world of FF8 would be like and what it might feel like to live in it, inside a world where everyone believes you will inevitably turn into a monster. Even as all the terrible things remain and are inexcusable, I get how easy it'd be to go off the deep end from that sort of existence. 

Those are my three long form fics. I don’t think any record remains of them unless it is recorded in some of my old notebooks somewhere. The rest are just your typical one-shot type of thing between different pairings. 

I haven’t really written fanfiction in years, I wrote mostly original fiction these days. Although, I do still read the odd fanfic here and there.

She also read Lord of the Rings to me in Russian when I was around 10. She hd to explain a lot of the words because it is a more advanced language. This is the only book where I think the translation is better than the original. I re-read LOTR in English as an adult and thought.. ""Is this really it?"". It couldn't beat the experience with the books I had as a child. I found the entire reading experience quite dull. I love the franchise it has grown to, though. Russian has incredibly many synonyms and you can convey a lot of meaning with a lot of nuances. The entire world building had somehow seemed more nuanced to me 😅 but it could also be that being a child made the books seem grander than they are, Indon't know. My reading level in Russian is that of an 7 year old, so I'm not gonna retry LOTR in Russian.

**Alchemy of Souls** (2022, Korean) - Epic fantasy, Korean style

**Love Between Fairy and Devil** (2022, Chinese) - Epic fantasy, Chinese style  (live-action TV series based on a webnovel; there is also a greatly inferior animated version that is closer to the source material)

However, since you are looking for something *different,* might I tempt you with something truly unique? It isn't epic fantasy as the stakes are much lower and more personal, but it is one of the most beloved Korean fantasy series.

I really dislike Hadrian. He’s such an ahole and thinks he’s so holier than thou and so judgemental to everyone whos different than him. It was really summed up to me when he was talking w Hector and he was basically slut shaming him because he’s not in love with everyone he sleeps with. This to me is straight from Ruocchio who married his childhood sweetheart super young and is religious, and can’t seem to fathom that some people sleep w different people before settling down and there’s nothing wrong w that.

I also hate how he always puts Hadrian in these impossible situations and then he either bumbles his way out of them in a miracle or gets captured and they refuse to kill him and then he bungles his way out of it in a miracle. 

I also don’t understand why on tik tok everyone ranks him as one of their favorite characters of all time. He’s so basic and boring. Just a plot device. Again I enjoy the plot and the world but not sure why everyone thinks they’re the greatest novels of all time.

""Disruptive"" authors don't realize how cyclical the underlying fantasy framework really is.  Writing ""Elric but Catholic"" is especially funny in that sense, because it fundamentally strips the character of their narrative purpose (showing the weight of entropy) and instead becomes an exercise in ideological masturbation (showing the holy justification of purgation). The former is introspectively fascinating because it challenges the fantasy reader to see the Tolkien temple inverted (""the chosen hero has a cursed sword and brings ruin to all he touches""); the latter is just the same upright temple with a black coat of paint (""the hero has a cursed sword but delivers us from greater evil while being sad about it"").

But... there are options. Malazan, as you mentioned is one. The Wheel of Time is some of the best world-building out there, but it's more Tolkien-esque than Forgotten Realms. Maybe Cradle by Will Wight?

_The Shadow of the Apt_ by Adrian Tchaikovsky comes to mind as a top choice, though. There are dozens of races and a sprawling world, with each city-state with its own quirks and interactions, and those quirks actually have consequences in the world.

Beyond that, I'm not super sure I can think of anything that really fits your brief. Most authors do just enough world-building to tell their trilogy.

My addition to what he initially said is that you've put in the narrative work for your concept (the camera element), but you're missing key elements of the two interpersonal conflicts. First, with the female character, you've left the audience with a confusing situation between the awkward run in and the happy flashbacks, which sets us on edge of whether we side with the protagonist, or feel like the protagonist did something wrong. More importantly, however, is that you haven't set up the twist/second male character conflict whatsoever. Is he a bad guy? Is he her security, protecting her from the protagonist? Is he a stalker? Are they both competing stalkers? Does he also have the camera thingy, or is he normal bad instead of super bad?

Think of a twist in any story like something you need to afford to buy - you need to earn some currency with the audience before you can deploy it. Gollum following Frodo and Sam into Mt Doom only works because we've seen him doggedly following them for 3 movies. It is surprising but feels inevitable, because the set up earned that inevitability.

1c5d9c2a-7f1d-474c-8814-1f2f3a9f5c01,1ohnapc,Medievalart,HandDrawnFantasyMaps,"I recently completed work on Beregond's Map of Middle Earth and wanted to share it with you all. The map should have taken me about 160 hours to make, but it ended up being closer to 200-220, as I got 70% of the way through my first version of the map before deciding to use different pens and ink.

The map is oriented to the West, a sacred direction to the Gondorians and the Elves, as it points to the Undying Lands and Numenor under-the-sea. This was inspired in part by the medieval European tradition of orienting maps to the East - pointing towards Jerusalem as the center of the world.

I based the map's style primarily on that of 16th century Dutch cartographer Jan van Linschoten (maps attached at end), but also drew a lot of inspiration from the Catalan Atlas of 1375 and Olaus Magnus's Carta Marina (also attached.) Given the relatively low level of technology that would be available to Gondorian mapmakers, I made sure to keep the area around Gondor fairly accurate while distorting the geography of the more distant regions.

The map features an iconographic border depicting scenes from the Silmarillion. The top depicts the early history of the world, and the bottom depicts the fight against Morgoth in the First Age. At left is the history of the Men of the West, and at right the history of the Elves and Dwarves.

There are also references to Tolkien's own illustrations, as well as those of Pauline Baynes.

All of the inscriptions have meaning, and I will provide a full translation of the map in the coming weeks. The one in Harad between the snakes and the king reads: ""This sovereign is called Marwan. He is the noblest and richest of all Harad. He commands an army of 864 Mûmakil, 62,208 riders, and countless men.""

I'll send a free print to the first commenter on this or any other post to provide the full English translation of the cartouche in the lower left portion of the map (all three sections). [Edit: someone got it over on r/tengwar]

I'm excited to share my progress on this map of Middle Earth from the perspective of a Gondorian cartographer, Beregond Damrodion. This map was made in the late Third Age, after Sauron's return to Mordor but before his defeat in the War of the Ring. The map is oriented to the West, towards the Undying Lands as a sacred direction. 

The style is inspired by that of Dutch cartographer Jan van Linschoten as well as Swedish cartographer Olaus Magnus (admittedly, from the early modern period), and many of the inscriptions draw some inspiration from the 1375 Catalan Atlas. I've also included a few maniculae and some medieval-style illustrations of various animals. Some of the illustrations are references to Tolkien's own illustrations, or to those of Pauline Baynes. I will eventually also make a watercolor version of the map, which I intend to illuminate with gold. And of course, all of the inscriptions are written in Tengwar.

Next on my to-do list is the iconographic border depicting scenes from the Silmarillion, which will also draw on a medieval religious iconographic style, including illustrations of the hand of God.

Black-and-white prints will be available this summer, and color prints will be available God-knows-when.

its a harder to identify oppression through surveillance than nuclear war, to put it mildly, and i would grant that surveillance can be go from being benign to malicious as quickly Saruman's use of the palantir went from good to evil.

Its not a reference to investing xD. Its more of a reference to Tolkien, history and politics. Sometimes conservatives say they are ""fighting the long defeat"" - so it is a reference to that or Hitler's accusations against the generals of the German Wehrmacht (I'd rather be denounced as a defeatist in Germany after World War I than go into another round... ) and the Tolkien meaning which is explained in the link below

[https://annex.fandom.com/wiki/Long\_defeat](https://annex.fandom.com/wiki/Long_defeat)

It is mostly taken as a slur to be called a defeatist, or you say it to people who have depressive opinions on certain matters - but intend a very different meaning. Your suggestions are certainly interesting but I think I can't comment on future in that way, especially not on broad psycho-sociological matters or the functionality of certain attitudes in some sort of ""marketplace of mindset"".

He believes that something might happen if and when Girard's teachings become more widespread.  Something that may transform the way we live.  

He was raised evangelical Christian, so obviously The Bible - The New Testament in particular.  Watch his dialogues with NT Wright.

In the late 90s he read The Sovereign Individual which he said was influential in his thinking.  It's a book about futurism and how the information revolution will transform life and political arrangements.  

If you count Tolkein and The Lord of the Rings, he appears to be influenced by that world too.  

Generally, he seems fluent in the Western Canon and opines discursively on a range of philosophers and writers.  He's not a fan of Epicureanism and thinks that Marx was right to be afraid of it (even though he's not a Marxist, he and Karl may agree on that).  

He believes The Enlightenment abandoned the question of human nature; he believes in human agency but doesn't appear to believe in ""the God of St. Augustine"" - which he interprets as being all-knowing, completely inside and outside you.  This might be why the world of Tolkein appeals to him, as it has a complicated structure of deities with higher powers having particular purviews.  

He's critical of Kurzweil's lack of emphasis on human agency.  He believes that that medieval people believed in ""the power of the intellect"" but not ""the will"", and that modern people believe in the reverse: the power of the will but the weakness of the intellect.  He suspects Shakespeare makes a point by putting the phrase ""all that lives must die"" in the mouth of Hamlet's mother (he says ""evil mother"") - which dovetails with his emphasis on longevity research as a moral good.  

He thinks Dante made a point of having this famous quote come from the mouth of someone who was in fact in hell: ""The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven"".  He ties this in with his refusal of the ""interiority"" that he sees in society since the 60s - and which may be a contributing philosophical cause of the modern lack of human agency.  Instead of working to make the world better we can do yoga and smoke pot and move inwards.  It seems he would rather work to get out of hell than convince himself that he's not there.  In short, he believes in the external world.  Like Merry telling Treebeard, ""you're part of this world, aren't you?""

84c77edd-fbad-40b0-b899-ce64be5d3ac5,1pfjwuh,PLTR,GabFromMars,"Some say “Palantir” comes from Tolkien’s seeing-stones, but insiders whisper a deeper origin.
The early team supposedly used Palatinus—the Roman hill of augurs—as a codename for “seeing what others can’t”.
The fusion of Palatinus → Palantir became an internal joke: a tool that doesn’t predict the future… it just removes the fog.
True or not, the myth stuck — and the company never corrected it, because every good intelligence platform needs its own origin story.",13,2025-12-06 08:51:09+00:00,LOW,1.0,15.27619212962963,"Weekend Discussion Thread! Palantir, PLTR &amp; Chill 😎"
