That said, I think there are some improvements that can be made. Here's a few I thought of, and I'd love to see anyone else's ideas in the comments!

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

What do you think?

Besides these things that others have already mentioned, I’ve got two ideas that would fit in with what they sort of already have and another that’s a bit of a stretch.

1. Make the decorations matter for what kind of meal you’re having. You better put out tea if you have people over for afternoon tea!
2. Let me play the board games with folks. I want to play ‘Dwarf Mining’ against Nefi! This would be a nice thing to have as a post meal activity if your guests are interested. The food is important but that’s not all there is to a good meal. This is a bit of a stretch since it would require making up playable rules for the games and such, but it doesn’t seem too difficult since the mini-game screen can be mostly static.

3. This is an idea for another club that I think hobbits would be interested in. Birding! Just walk around and sight the birds that are about and learn to recognize their sounds. This is a stretch as it would require quite a bit of new assets and mechanics in the game. But it’s a fun idea for new clubs.

Oh, and I’d like to see more seasonal attire. Scarfs and hats for winter, especially please!",1,2025-08-13 06:10:02+00:00,Add-ons you think would improve the game even more!,"TL;DR Let's talk about functions that could enhance gameplay/enjoyment even further!

I'm not generally a cozy game player, but I felt like the atmosphere and setting of this game would go a long way for me! And I am happy to say that I have spent over 30 hours fully engrossed and in love with the game!

That said, I think there are some improvements that can be made. Here's a few I thought of, and I'd love to see anyone else's ideas in the comments!

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

What do you think?

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

-A walk toggle for mouse and keyboard. It always drives me crazy when your character is the only one in a hurry to get anywhere. It's a small immersion break but I always notice it.

-I think there's some missed opportunity for romance, I personally think romancing Willow would be such a playful and fitting way to explore how kind she actually is, but I'm ok with it not being there. 

-Festivals! The main story festival felt like literally the only part of the game that was undercooked. Have mini games, contests, bring Gandalf back for the yearly Bywater Village Festival so that you can see him and interact with him past the main story.

Specifically I'd love to see an expansion that adds ranching and getting a sheep dog to help take care of your sheep and cows. Even if it's limited to like two of each. And in the evening the dog comes in the house to hang out with you and a job well done. 

-A walk toggle for mouse and keyboard. It always drives me crazy when your character is the only one in a hurry to get anywhere. It's a small immersion break but I always notice it.

-I think there's some missed opportunity for romance, I personally think romancing Willow would be such a playful and fitting way to explore how kind she actually is, but I'm ok with it not being there. 

-Festivals! The main story festival felt like literally the only part of the game that was undercooked. Have mini games, contests, bring Gandalf back for the yearly Bywater Village Festival so that you can see him and interact with him past the main story.

I'm really hopeful that the positive word of mouth since launch is going to translate into enough sales to see at least a few updates. Even the cozygamer sub has turned a corner on the game and started praising it","Post: Add-ons you think would improve the game even more! Comment: -I want a cat or a dog.

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

What do you think?

Being able to put custom labels down on the map! I know there are some food ones already but I noticed there weren't ones for everything. Map could get cluttered I guess 

Also, when trading, the trade screen staying open like in shops, rather than closing to speech and showing the hobbit passing you the goods. It's fine for one trade but when trading multiple things, it gets boring!

I also love the ideas already said about birthdays/festivals and celebrations. There's 2 weeks every season, a party each week would be lovely, sending invites, collecting gifts, preparing food

No brainer, but more quests! Mini fetch quests, post quests, competitions - Like a fishing contest.

I'm not generally a cozy game player, but I felt like the atmosphere and setting of this game would go a long way for me! And I am happy to say that I have spent over 30 hours fully engrossed and in love with the game!

That said, I think there are some improvements that can be made. Here's a few I thought of, and I'd love to see anyone else's ideas in the comments!

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

I'm not generally a cozy game player, but I felt like the atmosphere and setting of this game would go a long way for me! And I am happy to say that I have spent over 30 hours fully engrossed and in love with the game!

That said, I think there are some improvements that can be made. Here's a few I thought of, and I'd love to see anyone else's ideas in the comments!

1- More time: I feel like I can only do 1 or 2 short things before the day time shifts. And if I have to go a ways around the map, like even to the village square, it feels like it just goes by too short. Maybe it could do with each slot being half again longer? But only if #2 is also implemented:

2-Time wasters: actions to make time pass would be great, especially when you want to reset a fishing spot, or you're just waiting for evening to hit so you can get to bed to start the next day. Giving these actions some small mechanical bonus (maybe increased chance for higher star items?) would make it even better. This could be lazing about in the countryside, napping in a rocking chair, or chatting with a friend.

3-Not have to be the sole party arranger! It would be really rewarding if YOU could be invited for dinner for once! Maybe that could be the way to receive new recipes, or get an inspiration boost for when you cook next.

What do you think?

Hobbits are supposed to be weirdly nimble and quiet despite their large feet and Frodo proves they can climb trees, so why is a small ledge that doesn't even reach a hobbits knee keeping me from jumping down onto a path?), seasonal festivals, better npcs/relationships, multiplayer (be it Palia style or even sharing a smial. Each person being able to have ""their room"" and style it how they want would be just as cool as their own house imo), crafting like Animal Crossing, seasonal/special visitors like Bilbo etc. I also understand that smoking/drinking/brewing aren't included due to the age rating, but think that could at least be made a dlc for adults who might want it.

I like the idea of petting the animals too, great thing to add, it is cute when you greet them they sit down, I wonder if this is to be helpful in photo mode?

I would like to close the door too.

It would be nice to edit the meal plan invitation, to add a field to write your own bit into it to be more personable.

""Hullo Sandyman and Farmer Cotton, I think I'd like us all to sit down and talk about.... ""

It would be cool to get invites and enter other hobbit homes, 
+ experiment with recipes,
+ have a pub meal
All that will give a little light bulb moment for a new recipe idea.

It would be nice to have recipes have a real world IRL link to make a recipe based off the dish you've made.
Fish pie, Rhubarb... 
Like I think there was a cook book from LoTR that gave inspired recipes to make something like Lembas Bread (I hope that might be in ToTS tbh).

I'd like to jump, and I don't mind about not being able to swim.

It would be nice to have more dialogue that mix and matches so it isn't exactly the same goodbye from what I've noticed.

+ it seems strange can't buy any items from the pub...

It would be nice if we had a dialogue pop up box from punters and other Hobbits that came up in a colour to represent a rumour about an interactable Hobbit's favourite thing.

""Orlo really likes...""
But then we don't know if it's true and get to have fun testing that out.

It would be nice to be able to write a story, a book on the desk to go and add something to it.

1. Actually being able to pet the animals, maybe feed them.

2. Sitting on my furniture, interact with things in my house, a bath would be fun? Or being able to make a coffee and sit on a chair at the fire. Or warming my hands at the fire..

3. Cooking for myself, serving it for myself, eating it myself.

4. Being able to close my door, when it rains etc I'd like to be able to be cozy in my house and close the door.. I don't know if that changes later when I unlock the main door but right now the back door is always open.

5. I wish I was able to swim, right now you can't even enter the water at all.
