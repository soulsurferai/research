Sorry if I didn’t explain better in the title but my shop already has jars and boxes for disposables with our branding. What Im looking for is the best printer for adding the little labels like 1 3/4 x 1/2 in for strains and coa qr codes. Looking to make the most out of my time and be efficient. Would you suggest a thermal or a laser printer? The benefit of thermal printing is obvious but I dont know if there is a thermal printer that would allow me to do sheets at a time? Thank you so much for your help as always and happy new year', ""Decent Shredder &amp; Upgrade my Buddy Box 1 1/4  Currently, I'm shredding my weed by hand and using the Buddy Box; it was nice and fun but sales are picking up to the point where i want to automate the process a bit.  Looking for some upgrades in shredding and separating and filling cones.  Curious if there is any other players out there besides Futurola products."", 'King Kone metering tray  I have a small preroll business and we just got the King Kone machine. We got the half gram metering tray and when filled it’s consistently producing .35g prerolls. It’s frustrating because now we have to adjust by hand, which defeats the point of having the machine in the first place. I’ve tried different grinding, different flower, etc. and it’s .35 every time. Anyone else have this experience?']",weedbiz
