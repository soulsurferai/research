Please contribute! The last two times we posted a list, it made waves in the Oregon Cannabis community. So many of the shops on list v2.0 are out of business now, or had to be restructured. It made more sense to start from scratch this time, so please contribute if you know anyone!\n\n[Blacklist for OR cannabis companies that have issues with non-payment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ORWeedBiz/comments/1ej4gl8/new_2024_official_black_list_for_dispensaries/)"", 'Whats the Best Soil for Autoflower Cannabis Seeds? Hey everyone, just wanted to share some insights in case it helps anyone in the cannabis biz. I’ve been growing commercially for three years, and one thing that can make or break an autoflower run is your soil mix. Since autos are more sensitive to nutrients than photoperiods, getting the right balance is key.\n\nHere are some of the top soil options that growers swear by:\n\n**Fox Farm Ocean Forest** – A nutrient-rich “hot” mix that’s great for later veg and flower but might be too strong for seedlings. Many growers cut it with perlite or coco to avoid early burn.\n\n**Fox Farm Happy Frog** – Milder than Ocean Forest, making it better for seedlings. Some growers start with Happy Frog and transplant into Ocean Forest for a balanced approach.\n\n**BioBizz Light Mix** – Organic and low in nutrients, giving you full control over feeding. If you like dialing in your own nutrient schedule, this is a solid base. BioBizz All Mix is also an option, but it’s a bit richer.\n\n**BuildASoil 3.0** – A premium living soil blend designed for water-only grows. If you want a low-maintenance, no-bottle feeding setup, this is a top choice.\n\n**Coco + Perlite Mix (70/30)** – While not technically soil, this mix is loved by autoflower growers because it promotes fast root growth and full nutrient control. Just remember to start feeding from day one since coco has zero nutrients on its own.\n\nDo you stick to a pre-mixed soil, or do you mix your own?']",weedbiz

Sorry if I didn’t explain better in the title but my shop already has jars and boxes for disposables with our branding. What Im looking for is the best printer for adding the little labels like 1 3/4 x 1/2 in for strains and coa qr codes. Looking to make the most out of my time and be efficient. Would you suggest a thermal or a laser printer? The benefit of thermal printing is obvious but I dont know if there is a thermal printer that would allow me to do sheets at a time? Thank you so much for your help as always and happy new year', ""Decent Shredder &amp; Upgrade my Buddy Box 1 1/4  Currently, I'm shredding my weed by hand and using the Buddy Box; it was nice and fun but sales are picking up to the point where i want to automate the process a bit.  Looking for some upgrades in shredding and separating and filling cones.  Curious if there is any other players out there besides Futurola products."", 'King Kone metering tray  I have a small preroll business and we just got the King Kone machine. We got the half gram metering tray and when filled it’s consistently producing .35g prerolls. It’s frustrating because now we have to adjust by hand, which defeats the point of having the machine in the first place. I’ve tried different grinding, different flower, etc. and it’s .35 every time. Anyone else have this experience?']",weedbiz
