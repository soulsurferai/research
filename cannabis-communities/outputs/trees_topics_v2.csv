If the Senate agrees, Idahoans will vote in 2026 on whether only lawmakers can decide on psychoactive substances. A separate cannabis decrim effort is underway', 'Too Baked to Temp Step Your Vape? Let iOS Remind You If you’re staging or stepping up your vaping temperature during a session, it’s easy to get too baked and forget to bump it up. I made a customizable session timer using the iOS Shortcuts app — it sends a notification **with sound** (volume depends on your system’s *“Sounds &amp; Haptics” &gt; “Ringtone and Alerts”* setting).\n\nThe stopwatch also tracks the elapsed time since your last session. It records a lap at each temperature stage — by default, **lap 4** triggers the “*coughing/burnt*” notification.\n\n[This app\'s output preview.](https://preview.redd.it/6i509ntpw5ve1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=730f01c034f219a9abbada7e22febf7aeb68cf9e)\n\n# App modification (not prerequisites; skip to FAQ) --\n\nThe dictionary named ""Temp Range"" is used to configure the preheat timer (some users like to wait 5–15 seconds before hitting the bowl) and the temperature stages — including draw time, exhale/rest time (in seconds), and the target temperature for each notification.\n\nThe last list **defines** the temperature stages **you’ll be vaping at**, manually sorted from top to bottom in the desired order. Each notification will include a randomly selected quote from the list beneath that. The **final item in the list** is reserved for a separate notification, so please avoid using that row.\n\n[Most customizing variables are grouped at the top of this app\'s \\\\""source code\\\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/4z1evhgsw5ve1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=484acbdddd3755cd7bdc157327d0878ce986a83f)\n\n# Predict FAQ? --\n\n**Q1: I had Silent Mode on — why were the notifications still so loud?**  \n**A:** This shortcut *temporarily* disables Silent Mode until the session ends. If you want to **keep Silent Mode on**, simply delete the **two** code blocks in the shortcut that control Silent Mode.\n\n**Q2: I don’t do temperature stepping. I just want something quieter at the end of my session — the loud timer freaks me out. I also want to free up a hand to pause the alarm.**  \n**A:** You can create a separate shortcut using stopwatch blocks arranged in sequential order. Then, use a combination of **“Wait X seconds”** and **“Show Notification”** blocks instead of a loud timer. That way, you’ll get a subtle reminder without the noise — and you’ll have a free hand to pause it if needed.\n\n**Q3: I edited the app, but now it won’t run.**  \n**A:** Double-check for any syntax errors or missing components — the cross button is quite close to the edge, so you might have accidentally removed a block. Ensure all required blocks are properly linked and that the flow is intact. If everything seems in order but it\'s still not working, feel free to leave a comment *with the prefix \\[Ques\\],* and I’ll try to help with that.\n\nDownload link: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b32be173bcae40cc95050e2227fd574a](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b32be173bcae40cc95050e2227fd574a)\n\n**Note**: You will need a stopwatch to record the inhale time for each temperature session. You simply lap the timer before exhaling, and after your rest (personal preference). Feel free to ask any questions in the comments.\n\nI’ve put a lot of time (and lung power) into tuning this shortcut. If you share or repost, kindly credit this post. FYI, I use a Solo 3 v1.0 with a medium-sized bong, and my temperature recipe is included with this app.']",trees
