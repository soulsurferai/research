# Cannabis Communities (work files)

This folder contains the artifacts behind the **Cannabis Communities** report on the Noetheca portfolio.

## Contents

- `outputs/` — the report outputs copied from `Topics_V1/results/` (cannabis-related subset)
- `inputs/subreddits_used.json` — the subreddit set used for the cross-community comparison (derived from `outputs/subreddit_comparison.csv`)
- `PIPELINE.md` — points to the shared pipeline code used to generate these outputs

## Notes

- This is a curated subset intended for provenance and review.
- The underlying reusable pipeline code lives in `/_pipelines/topics-v1/`.
