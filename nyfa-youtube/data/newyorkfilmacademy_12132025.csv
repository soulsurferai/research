Michael Troast is a photographer based in Brooklyn. He got his first camera at 12, built a darkroom by 13 with gear from a $150 yard sale haul, and spent his teens chasing skateboarding, graffiti, and street life through a lens.

After helping launch Gotham and Complex magazines in the early 2000s, Michael went on to manage studios, lead creative teams, and produce hundreds of shoots — from Fox Racing in California to eCommerce in Hoboken.

Now he runs his own space in the Lower East Side, where every shoot starts with understanding what the client actually needs. He’s hands-on with set building and design, and swears the easy part is taking the photo — the hard part is everything before it.

w7cuIXPxP0g,NYFA FILMMAKING HIGHLIGHTS,"TAKE A LOOK INTO SOME OF THE WORK OUR FILMMAKING STORYTELLERS HAVE CREATED WHILE HERE AT NYFA! 

Filmmakers tell captivating stories through film, television, and new media, using compelling narratives and engaging performances to bring their cinematic vision to life. At NYFA’s Film School, aspiring filmmakers master these skills and techniques, choosing from a variety of Filmmaking degrees, certificate programs, and workshops at our campuses in New York, Los Angeles, and Florence (Italy), as well as numerous international locations. During these hands-on programs, students learn-by-doing, spending a majority of their studies writing, shooting, editing, directing, and producing original films and digital content.

Through robust coursework, production workshops, and actual on-set experience that reflects the work done within the film industry, students build their confidence as directors and filmmakers. NYFA filmmaking students explore every phase of classical film structure and content creation, receiving a well-rounded education in the always-evolving art of visual storytelling. Our rigorous, accelerated approach provides students with the opportunity to make a number of films during their time at NYFA, and graduates leave our programs with a selection of their best work. Typically, the longer the program, the more content and films students get to create. For students interested in creating non-fiction content, we also offer a number of programs specifically for documentary films.

As the original disruptors of the Hollywood gate-keeping system, NYFA strives to make education in filmmaking accessible to the most diverse, international, and broadest community of students. At our film school, we foster an environment that is creatively challenging, respectful, and actively supportive of each unique student and of a collectively diverse student body.

D8QLzliOuAQ,How two NYFA Alums crafted the Film Festival Run of Their Dreams,"New York Film Academy (NYFA) welcomed back NY Film Academy Alums Lucía Flórez and Chémi Pérez as part of our Guest Speaker series moderated by Senior Director of NYFA’s Film Festival Department, Crickett Rumley.

Getting into the Sundance Film Festival is every emerging filmmaker’s dream, yet each year less than one percent of submitted shorts get selected.  This past August, Crickett Rumley sat down for a conversation with Lucía Flórez and Chémi Pérez, who beat the odds when their documentary “Shirampari: Legacies of the River” became an official selection of Sundance’s 2023 edition. In this Q&A, they discussed how they developed a festival strategy unique to them and their film, what they learned in the early months of their submission process and festival run, and how they prepared for -- and made the most of -- their Sundance experience.

EIv-0CdNml8,The 20/20 Series with Marcus Stokes,"In March 2021, we welcomed Film & TV Director Marcus Stokes as part of The 20/20 Series, created by NYFA’s Creative Director of Filmmaking and Cinematography, Liz Hinlein.



Marcus Stokes worked as a computer graphics artist at George Lucas’ Industrial Light and Magic (ILM). While at ILM, Stokes created groundbreaking visual effects for blockbuster films including Star Wars Episode I, Minority Report, and The Mummy. He then moved to Los Angeles and supervised visual effects for The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix: Revolutions, I Robot, and Serenity.
Stokes officially began his directorial career when he joined the Director’s Guild of America as a commercial director and created ads for clients including GMC, Nissan, and Walt Disney Pictures. Soon after, he realized his true passion for narrative filmmaking and began creating his own content. His very first film as writer/director, The Catalyst, was acquired by HBO and aired on their networks for two years. He has since gone on to direct shows including Criminal Minds, 911, The Flash, Station 19, and The Astronauts.
Stokes joined the conversation from Canada where he was currently preparing to shoot episodes for the upcoming season of The CW’s popular series The Flash. Stokes spoke with Hinlein about how his VFX background at ILM exposed him to the filmmaking process and granted him facetime with some of the business’s most talented directors. It was this exposure to the role that allowed Stokes to be confident to transfer his skills for VFX and filmmaking to pursue becoming a director himself, citing mentors F. Gary Gray (Straight Outta Compton) and Tim Story (Fantastic Four) as his mentors.

Ef9q2h2MBv0,NYFA's Q&A-List with Tova Laiter: Kevin Nealon,"New York Film Academy had the honor of hosting a live video Q&A with Former SNL Cast Member & Comedian Kevin Nealon. Tova Laiter, Director of the NYFA Q&A-List Series, moderated the event along with NYFA LA Faculty member Eric Conner. Together, they chatted with Nealon about his role on SNL and career in film.

Kevin Nealon is an Emmy and SAG-nominated actor and comedian who sets himself apart from other comedic performers with his unique sense of humor, dry wit, and likable demeanor. 

Nealon is best known for his nine-year stint as a cast member of NBC’s Saturday Night Live, and received critical acclaim for his role in the hit Showtime series Weeds. Kevin currently produces and hosts his digital series Hiking with Kevin, and tours his stand-up globally. He will be releasing his latest book “I Exaggerate: My Brushes with Fame” on October 25th, 2022, published by Abrams Books. Part art book, part memoir -- the book is full of original full-color caricatures Kevin has created along with funny, endearing personal essays about his famous friends. 

Nealon has found great comedic success in his extensive film career. In Anger Management, he played opposite Jack Nicholson and fellow SNL comedian Adam Sandler. He and Sandler teamed up in Eight Crazy Nights, The Wedding Singer, Happy Gilmore, Just Go With It, Blended, and You Don’t Mess with the Zohan, the latter of which grossed over $200 million worldwide. 

As one of the longest-running cast members on NBC’s Saturday Night Live (1986-1995), Nealon created some of the show’s most memorable characters including ‘The Subliminal Man’ and ‘Hans and Franz.’ Nealon’s recurring role as an anchor on ‘Weekend Update’ helped make the sketch a show staple. In 1988, he earned an Emmy nomination as part of the SNL writing team.

About Emmy Rossum
Emmy Rossum has been captivating audiences with her varied and exceptional talents for over a decade. Rossum’s performance in Songcatcher earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination in the category of “Best Debut Performance.” Four years later in 2004, her starring performance as “Christine” in The Phantom of the Opera earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination, as well as the National Board of Review’s “Best Female Breakthrough Performance” Award and the Broadcast Film Critics Association’s “Best Young Actress” Award in 2005.

Rossum can currently be seen starring in Angelyne, a limited series based on The Hollywood Reporter's investigative feature about the life of Los Angeles’ mysterious billboard icon. Rossum executive produced and stars in the series, with critics hailing her performance as “incandescent and gritty and equal measure,” and “dazzling.” The 5-episode limited series is available on Peacock.

Rossum starred as ‘Fiona Gallagher’ in Showtime’s critically acclaimed dark comedy series, Shameless, for nine seasons, departing the series in 2019. Rossum made her directorial debut on the series in the seventh season for the episode I Am a Storm, and directed on the series for the second time for the eighth season episode Frank’s Northern Shuttle Express. Rossum also had the opportunity to direct an episode on another John Wells series, TNT’s Animal Kingdom. She also directed an episode of Amazon’s Modern Love series, based on The New York Times column of the same name.

In 2018, Rossum appeared opposite Will Forte in the Netflix original film A Futile and Stupid Gesture. The film follows the success of National Lampoon in the 1970’s and 80’s and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

Rossum’s other film credits include Comet opposite Justin Long and Shawn Christensen’s Before I Disappear, based on the 2012 Oscar-winning short Curfew, which won the prestigious “Audience Award” at SXSW.

Rossum began her theatrical career at the age of seven when she began singing the children’s roles at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center.

QrlzVp3NjkU,NYFA Guest Speaker Series: Team Behind ‘Exposure’,"New York Film Academy & GreenLight Women brought an exciting guest speaker event with the team behind the documentary Exposure, which follows the expedition of ordinary women from across the globe who face danger and overcome all obstacles in order to travel to the melting Arctic polar ice cap.

Kicking off the event at our Los Angeles Campus, current students and alums had the opportunity to watch Exposure: Risking Everything For True North before joining a conversation moderated by producer Carolyn Pfeiffer with the film’s Director Holly Morris, Producer Jill Mazursky, and Jeremy Gold, Executive Producer & President of Production Blumhouse Television.


About Exposure
As the Arctic polar ice cap melts, reaching the North Pole has become increasingly dangerous. Yet an expedition of ordinary women from the Arab world, the west strap on skis and haul heaving sledges toward true north, against all odds and polar advice.

Award-winning Filmmaker Holly Morris captures it all, from frostbite and polar bear threats to sexism and self-doubt in this intimate story of resilience, survival, and global citizenry–on what may be the last-ever expedition to the top of the world.

The film is produced by Powderkeg Studios & Blumhouse Television.

5kLCY1XwC2k,NYFA Photo Guest Speaker Series: The Importance of Publishing your work,"The importance of publishing your work can't be understated. Getting your work out there for the world to see is a hugely gratifying feeling. But it's not just about getting your work seen. Publishing your work can also be a great way to connect with other artists and create a community around your work. It can help you improve as an artist, push you to create even better work in the future, and inspire others to create their own art. 

On this online Q&A, photographer and NYFA Los Angeles Instructor Nikk Rich moderates a chat with #NYFA Photography Alumni Jon Henry, Mariangela Quiroga Cantillo and Rutvik Katuri, and Float Photo Magazine Co-founder and Photographer Dana Stirling to discuss the value of publishing photography work in books, magazines as well as digital placement.

Hinlein kicked off the conversation by asking both Kay and Perabo about what it can be like directing or acting on a television set versus a film set. “You’re working within an assigned series of limitations, which is great,” Kay responded. He recalled that episodes of 'The Shield,' and 'Friday Night Lights,' for example, were set up to be shot in a way that matched his style. Though, when directing television, it doesn’t always turn out that way. For an actor, Perabo notes, television can be tricky because “you don’t know the end of the story.” For films and plays, you can easily have an idea of where your character is headed and how to take them there. On a TV show, “things get thrown at you that you don’t always craft into your original performance.”

NYFA is also just one block away from the celebrated central market. 

NYFA Florence’s programs challenge students to interact with their surroundings while developing professional-level skills. Filmmaking students find themselves directly intermingling with the Italian people and culture, putting their knowledge to work as they make a series of short films. Acting for Film students perform in films shot on location, bringing stories and characters to life that reflects the culture and history of Florence. As students write, direct, shoot, edit and act in their own films, they acquire a deep understanding of Italian culture. Italy’s inhabitants become the characters in their stories. Italy’s traditions and customs shape their scripts, and Italy’s unique locations provide striking environments for original student films.

Transcript:
Hello! My name is Jongman Kim. I'm an alumni from New York Film Academy.

I'm on ""Love"" on Netflix, season 2 in episodes 10 and 11. My character is Victor. He's a famous action movie director. It's incredible. This is based on my experience from NYFA. NYFA teachers, they taught me a lot. Audition Technique, Acting for Film, Meisner Technique.

The great thing is they're working actors. They're not going to teach you just theory. They're going to teach you how you can use this theory or technique on set. We shot at the Universal Studios Backlot. We had a lot of chances to be in front of camera.

That experience in itself, that gave me my foundation of what I need to do to be an actor in Hollywood.",2017-05-19 19:06:15+00:00,PT1M6S,4983,72,4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4vn6NwdtGI,New York Film Academy,UC2_COAy4xu9Nffli2hsbDgA,66,3130,1.53,1.59,1.44

b4eoSzQBO_0,"""The Chronicles of Samurai Stewie"" by Andrew Kaufman","Short animated film by 4-Week Animation Student, Andrew Kaufman.

""The four week animation course is an intense experience,"" says Kaufman. ""From day one we delved right into it and learned at an exciting rate. Everyday we covered an enormous amount of material that only an expert in both animation and teaching could properly impart on us. It's amazing that we were taught in such a way that allowed us to understand the material so we could apply it to our own individual projects. The environment was one where students could interact with each other, share knowledge and help each other flesh out project ideas. It was also fun and invigorating to sit in the lab, by my computer working, and just banter with everyone. 

I loved the course. I met people from all over the world, I probably learnt more in a few weeks than I have in my entire college career, and I worked harder and couldn't have been happier doing it. I enjoyed this course so much I plan to come back for the one year animation course.

x66TCbiqS_Q,"'One Tough Melon"" by Tiffany Okel","Animated short created by 4-Week Animation student, Tiffany Okel.

The 4 week animation class at the New York Film Academy was an amazing experience,"" says Tiffany. ""Attempting to learn the entire process of producing a computer animation in such a short time span is considered impossible by some, but this course comfortably achieves just that. ""From concept art to final composition and all the steps in between, the entire process is covered by knowledgeable instructors ready to teach. It is true that there is not enough time to go into depth on any specific steps, but for a solid, complete, and accurate understanding of what is necessary for an animation to be created, this course proved to be outstanding. I am very happy with my experience and thrilled about what I was able to achieve through this course. I am excited to see where this experience and knowledge will take me in the future.""

AqcRO9_CiI8,Josh Winker - High Stakes,"Over a rainy weekend in 2010 Josh and his brother got on a kick of playing Uno. ""We must have played 200 hands that weekend"", comments Josh . A few games in, and they were taking it very seriously, as if it were a High Stakes match of sorts. After things reached a peak of intensity, Josh realized the ridiculousness of the situation. ""That, to me, was funny. I thought it would make a good short film."" During the writing process, It was important to Josh to keep all of the dialogue and action serious in tone while maintaining the context of Uno. ""I decided to riddle my screenplay with as many clichés as I could think of. A High Stakes match in an abandoned warehouse between a young ""kid"" and the dangerous, and of course, undefeated ringleader of the underground circuit."" 

Josh Winker attended the New York Film Academy's 1 year film making course, graduating in August of 2011. High Stakes was his Semester 1 Final Film.
