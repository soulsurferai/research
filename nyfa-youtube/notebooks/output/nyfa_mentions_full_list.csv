Stuff we use:
CAMERA - This is the camera we have used to film 90+% of our interviews (over 200 interviews and counting)  It continues to be our workhorse - http://amzn.to/2u66V1J

LENS - Most people ask us what camera we use, no one ever asks about the lens which filmmakers always tell us is more important.  This lens was a big investment for us and one we wish we could have made sooner.  Started using this lens at the end of 2013 - http://amzn.to/2tbtmOq

AUDIO 

Rode VideoMic Pro  - The Rode mic helps us capture our backup audio.  It also helps us sync up our audio in post http://amzn.to/2t1n2hx

Audio Recorder - If we had to do it all over again, this is probably the first item we would have bought - http://amzn.to/2tbFlM9

LIGHTS - Although we like to use as much natural light as we can, we often enhance the lighting with this small portable light.  We have two of them and they have saved us a number of times - http://amzn.to/2u5UnHv

COMPUTER - Our favorite computer, we each have one and have used various models since 2010 - http://amzn.to/2t1M67Z

EDITING - We upgraded our editing suite this year and we’re glad we did!  This has improved our workflow and the quality of our work.  Having new software also helps when we have a problem, it’s easy to search and find a solution - https://goo.gl/56LnpM

10 Things Foreign Actors Should Know About Moving To Los Angeles - Alison Balnar,2016-07-22 00:00:00,7097,243,31,2.07,3.86,224,p7opHhmjUtc,https://youtube.com/watch?v=p7opHhmjUtc,"CONNECT WITH ALISON BALNAR
http://www.alisonbalnar.com
https://twitter.com/AlisonBalnar

Alison Balnar began acting in 2004 at the age of ten, when she starred as ‘Dorothy’ in the theatre production of “The Wizard of Oz.” This experience created an everlasting love for the craft of acting. In 2012, she was awarded the Award of Merit for Performance by the Ontario Sears Drama Festival. She moved from Guelph, Ontario to Los Angeles to pursue her passion for acting in 2014 and she completed a one-year acting conservatory program at the New York Film Academy.

Balnar’s first acting role in Hollywood was as ‘Grace' in the short film “Director’s Choice.” She quickly landed her second role as ‘Diane’ in the short film “About Her.” In 2015, she completed filming the short film “60 Eight"" playing the role of ‘Sarah.’ The film premiered at Cannes Festival Short Film Corner in May 2016. Balnar appeared as ‘Ashley’ in director Carlos Aldana’s sci-fi short film “Nexus” which premiered at Space City Comic Con in Houston, Texas on May 28th, 2016. The film is shown over the course of two parallel universes. Balnar's character is stuck in a post-apocalyptic world, where humans are on the verge of extinction and she is trying to escape with her mother, played by Gigi Edgley. 

Balnar’s upcoming film roles include ‘Melissa Norris’ in “The Masters of Pulpits”, ‘Alex' in “The Past Perfect Tense.” and 'Carla Becker’ in “Bloggers.” “Bloggers” deals with both the inner and outer conflicts of the blogging world and the people in it. The film reveals how successful millennial entrepreneurs figure out what it means to have extraordinary jobs, real friendships and meaningful lives in a world that promotes the opposite.

In 2016, Balnar penned, directed and starred as ‘Mimi’ in the video short “The Dating Diaries.""

Balnar continues her drama studies with Brian Reise Studios and with the famed improv group and school, The Groundlings.
