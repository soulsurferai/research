Heat. Heat. Hello everyone and welcome to NEIFA Photo Events. Today we're proud to present Mike Trost.

Amid AI turmoil, Mike Trost is a refreshing one-of-a-kind photomaker. His work remains unrulled by Photoshop, which makes him totally dependent on the elements of surprise and chance. He embraces his profession in a way that frees him from the oppressive thinking that commercial work is simply a service industry. He also knows his way around creative problem solving and prides himself on the happy accidents that make memorable images. Although he has worked with huge clients for years, Mike is also humble enough to still assist other photographers if he feels he has something to learn from them. He says the easy part is taking the photo. The hard part is everything that comes before it. So Mike, turning it over to you now. We're here to help.

>> Hey everybody, Mike Trust here.

Mike, how you doing? Uh, want to just, you know, start going through my stuff here. Uh, you know, first things first, like really happy to be here. Really excited here in New York City. Um, 13-year-old me, if you ask me what I wanted to do, I wanted to be a professional photographer. And I' I've gotten to live my dream now. And, uh, I really don't know what else I'd rather be doing. And, uh, you know, as Nancy said, with AI, I'm just going to follow this to the end and then figure out what's next. and and like I hope you guys enjoy this. So, first we're going to start with my my mantras here is uh I'm happy to wake up every day. I really am. Um you know, it's like if I wake up in a bad mood, it doesn't help anything. I just really really enjoy being here. And then it'll work or it won't. Like life's really 50/50. You know, even if things kind of work out, it's a win. You know, not everything always goes as planned. And there's no reason you start out with doubt. I've been a photographer since I was 12 and uh my first camera was a Pentax K1 1000 came from my uncle and uh by 13 I had a dark room I built from, you know, yard sale stuff. Spent my ninth grade summer at uh FIT studying studio photography. Got to skateboard.

Just, you know, going to spray painting on things, taking pictures of street life. We just go home and and process film. just get to go home, develop stuff, and you know, you stick your finger in the water at 68 degrees, you knew it, like you could hit it every time. And uh it just it was a blessing.

Then there was a uh seismic shift in technology and school couldn't keep up with it. So I just started working. This was 1996. It was a transition from traditional design to uh computer desktop publishing. So the schools didn't know what to do. So I just went and worked. So I went out to um was working in the Hamptons and I finally got the call to come move to New York City. It's 2000. Went to Gotham Magazine. Just learning everything I could along the way. Really lucky I got tapped to help launch Complex Magazine 2002.

Um photo editor was great guy, buddy Matt Doyle, really good photographer, um portrait guy. taught me a ton about studio and we had to shoot everything ourselves. We just were, you know, a couple guys in a room making a magazine about hip-hop and uh it it was just great. You know, we had, you know, no money, but we got to work with some some great great photographers. Got to work with Robert Maxwell, John Manion, Nigel Cox, Jal GS, and um you just picked up picked up the pieces. You were like, you know, no problem. I got that. And that was your way of life. just always ready to help, always ready to learn something, and just being excited to be on set. You know, you never knew who you're going to run into. So, then, uh, opportunity knocks again. I moved out to California to go to Fox Racing. Uh, ran an in-house, uh, photo studio out there and, uh, had a good time, learned a lot of stuff. Called back up, hey, come back, move back to New York City. So moved back to work in an ad agency. I ran production, you know, had a couple kids, got married there for 13 years. Got to work with some really top level photographers. We had budgets from, you know, hey, can you shoot my shoot my restaurant menu to shooting Super Bowl spots. So it was really great. Got to learn the business of it. Got to learn all about cash flow.

got to learn just about managing clients and being on the agency side and uh then we were bought by IBM and I was laid off. And if you notice there's no uh work from these days in these slides because uh I learned a thing about redundancy. It was uh all my work was on our servers and because we were bought and then sold, they didn't care about our work. So everybody I was at the company I could ask my work for um it didn't exist anymore. The server died. They didn't want to pay to resurrect it. So I had lost uh about 16 17 years of work. And um it was kind of freeing actually because um you know it it wasn't about what I was about what I was going to be.

So then I uh I started making lemons into lemonade.

You know I was What am I going to do? I went and took a job in uh New Jersey in Hobok and ran a e-commerce studio and shot about 180 days a year, little no budget. Uh designed, built the sets, had to shoot. Uh we worked through COVID and we're the only non-manufacturing department in a 35,000 person company required to be in office. So, there's about four or five of us just using um employees, kids as talent, using whatever office space we have, whatever we could find and shoot because nobody was checking permits, so we could just kind of do whatever we wanted to do and uh play our reel from this time. Uh disregard the music. It wasn't my choice. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. And uh it kind of kept us sing, you know. we got to really still be creative and see people where so many people weren't getting to to be creative. So, it was kind of fun because we really got to take art and commerce and mix it together, you know. Um, and then my contract ended over there and I just kind of rolled the dice again. I went and came came and got a studio in Chinatown. Um, just had a good attitude about it and um 25 years of contacts. never say that attitude and I just went for it, you know. He said like this like just have fun with it. You none of this is rocket science. It's really not. You're taking photos and just kind of enjoying life. So um let take you through some of my more recent work.

See up here this was um some fun stuff I got to shoot. You know, I started calling people up from my agency days and who did I know? I knew people who are now uh creative directors, you know, brand managers and um people I had known for, you know, 15, 20, 25 years who started out the same place I did. And um it was good to look back and realize that like, you know, people I had never burned knew that I was going to do what I'd say I was going to do. So this this body armor job, it was it was great. And um they took a chance on me. So I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I can shoot this, whatever, whatever." And I, you know, did nest in it, came up with stuff. I called a great splash stylist I worked with in the past and we were just like, "This is our idea. Let's do it." I was like, "Yeah, yeah, no problem." And um it was fun. Like it's really fun. You know, it's it's part of this is the craft, you know, and this is where I think AI is is going to be the drain is because we're going to lose these people who who know very specific skills like making liquid splash a certain way or rigging a coconut to look like it's floating so that we can kind of get everything in camera without without having to just tell your computer to prompt it to do this. some other stuff just, you know, really it's uh it's kind of fun, you know, it's um every day you never know what you're gonna do. Somebody says, you know, oh, I have no budget. I have a a coffee company. We're launching this toasted coconut um flavor. What do you want to do with it? I'm like, I don't know. let me, you know, figure it out and start to, you know, this was a uh, you know, drilled a little hole in the back of a can and and took a hose and put some coffee in it and made myself a little pouring coffee rig and it was something I had never done before, but it was kind of a fun a fun exercise.

Sorry for the noise. We're on Orchard Street here. Um, peanut butter. Same thing. just, you know, we're going to shoot some peanut butter. No problem. And um I try to just capture shadows and light and reflections and and have things feel like they're rounded in real space. I feel like your light should make sense.

And uh you know, it's it's um it's kind of fun taking pictures of shiny stuff. You know, we were saying here's a uh guy on the left. This is a uh old coworker.

We had to do um corporate portraits for 300 people and uh a lot of them still using for their their LinkedIn photos, which is kind of funny. And it was just like let's let's have fun with it. And it was a really fun, you know, fun project. How do we keep 300 people straight? How do we have people just just go for it? And um most people don't like to be in front of a camera, you know. So it was a it was a kind of fun exercise just in in photography when I'm so used to shooting stuff like the one on the right. You know, you're the beautiful thing about shooting product and still life is it doesn't move. It doesn't um get shy in front of the camera. It doesn't um say no. It doesn't have to go to the bathroom. But um it's it's uh you lose a little bit of the um kind of sp spontaneity and that's what I do try to like to do with some my photography is keep it spontaneous. And uh here's another little video up here. This is for recent recent work for Lavaza. It's all e-commerce work.

Let's see. And that was work we were tapped to uh to do. This is where it's it's a really fine line between wanting to make stuff that's really good and stuff that is within budget. You know, this was like where we had very small budgets because it's it's e-commerce. It's not the brand work. So, we're trying to maximize the ROI for your customer. you know, like we want to do the best book we can and we have constraints. There's always like, you know, good, fast, cheap and for some reason everybody wants all free right now. It used to be you could have two, but it's not the way it is. And um it's up to us just to provide what we can within within our constraints and just make it as good as we can make it. Some more fun stuff here. this uh the company on the right was was my own company that um unfortunately had to sell and um it was it was interesting because I had been on the brand side, I had been on the agency side, um I had been on the publishing side, I'd been on the production side, but I was never my own client. And uh being your own client is really hard. But it helped me realize that sometimes you have to juggle between what the client wants, what creative needs, and what's actually feasible and practical. You know, doing stuff that, you know, it's it's it's a funny thing when people say, "Oh, selling out." Like, no, it's not selling out.

Sometimes it just is what it is, and you have to be okay with it. gotten a lucky to I get to work with Fuji a lot. Uh they tapped me to the launch of their uh the GFX RF. Beautiful camera. I was really I love shooting well-made things, you know, like very the glasses on the right. The stuff for catis like the the better made it is the easier it is to shoot. It's really beautiful stuff to shoot. You know, the hardest stuff in the world to shoot is cheap plastic. you know, it's really, really difficult. Shooting um, you know, white double wall plastic cups on on white backgrounds is very difficult. You know, shooting uh, a Tom Ford belt buckle is not hard at all. It's it lends itself to beautiful, beautiful photography, you know, going more light in motion.

It's uh crazy glue stuff was fun because we we did a whole thing about, you know, um kind of imperfection and having things, you know, there you used to everybody wants everything polished and beautiful. So, it it's kind of nice to have things a little imperfect sometimes. One left was just more more of that that same body armor job. And it just was a really fun dynamic. Uh we all got pretty wet shooting this, you know, and and uh I did learn a lot working with this stylist. It's um if you ever get a chance to look his work up, uh Brian Burn is set in ice.com.

He's really one of the best uh liquid ice stylists in New York City. Um a pleasure to work with people like that. Um, this stuff here is fun. Like, you know, on set, the left one, this stylist was jumping between still and video the whole time. And we was like, what are we going to do? We had a bunch of color aid and some some good hard lights. And we just were like, let's let's do it. Let's go. And we shot the stuff with no art direction, no reference, no anything. We just went and they were really happy with how it came out. again on the right. Beautiful stuff is easy to shoot, you know. and uh back here back to my own company again, you know, it was like uh our whole idea for it was, you know, share an ace, you know, and it was it was a fun it it was a really fun time in my life to have something like that I really cared about to work on, you know, and that that's what the was it was a good intersection of art and commerce for me because I realized I had to sell it. I was realized I was taking pictures of cheap plastic bottles and coffee beans and coffee bags, but I really really cared about it. And then now with my own work for for clients, I give them that same benefit of the doubt. I make sure I care about everything like it's my own. You know, when people hand me a budget, I get crazy about how we can maximize it. You know, how can I spend your money like it's my own money? And I really it's helped shape my career to a place now that um I don't know if it's been beneficial or detrimental to me just because it's I'm always thinking about the bottom line, but then I always want to do the best I can. So I end up kind of hurting myself sometimes, you know. But it's if if I'm okay with it. It's like it's better than roofing. It's better than carrying heavy stuff.

um you know, but it's still it's still uh commerce. Here was another this was a uh very low budget thing we got to do. Same thing, you know, let's have an idea. Let's go for it. You know, I I feel like they should pay us more for this stuff, but again, e-commerce budgets are not what they used to be. Which brings us to Next thing here, right? Art or commerce. The uh world needs art now more than ever. It really does. And um with AI, we need art that people make, you know, but it's hard to make art when you have to eat. It really is, you know. So, you make a decision, you know. It's if you if art is purely what matters, don't do it for a living, right? You go be a plumber, go be a hedge fund guy, go be whatever. don't be a commercial artist because it's um it it changes it. It really does. You know, it's it's uh Commerce kind of chose me. It said, you know, you know, hey, this is we're making this available to you. You can pay your bills. You can have a family. You can live in New York City by doing this. And I'm really lucky, really thankful that I've done that. And I'm every day I'm I'm happy about it. Um you know, it's a it's been kind of a playground. You know, I've learned to manage studios. I've learned to run shoots. I've learned to work with huge buzzes from no budgets, build sets, talk to my clients, meet people, and it's a joy. It really is. But it's still it's uh it's a job. You know, it's um one of the main things that I I would tell, you know, younger people or anybody, right, is is you listen before talking. Like our our real job is creative problem solving. It really is. It's um you know, client has a brief, they have needs. Don't think you know better than what the client's asking for. If they uh if if you're not meeting your needs, you're not doing the job. And it's like commercial art is is a service industry.

It it really is. And it's okay. You know, it's um you know, if if you don't if you go to a restaurant, the food's not good, no one's going to come back. If you're hard to work with, the client's not going to call you back. So, part of the biggest part of this is dealing with your clients and working with your clients.

And planning, planning is key. You know, the the easy part is is shooting really. The hard part is everything else. Um, every hour you shoot probably has three or four hours of planning. You know, set design, pre-pro, plant collaboration, you know, all the behind the scenes planning makes life a lot easier. like this shot here. This was a set we had to build. Um, we had no money. We had some some sheetrock and some wood and we built this three-dimensional huge set because there was a video component to this, too. We had to block it out. So, it was a a two- wall set with an island and it was all practical and it it looks like a render, but it's not. And it was kind of one of the most fun things we got to do, you know, and part of the planning is is thinking about retouching. Make your shot lists, have your endgame in mind when you start. You have to think fourthdimensionally. Think about in the future what someone's going to ask you to fix. You could fix it in camera and shoot, you know, shoot plates so that when you're compositing, it makes life a lot easier. Like we we shot this job with Matthew Rston, great photographer. It was Carrie Underwood.

Um, and somebody wasn't paying attention and it was like, you know, oh, straighten these cushions out in in post. Oh, we forgot to shoot her in front of a mirror for the back of her head when they wanted to put her in a bathroom with a mirror. So stuff that would have taken not even five minutes on set was 20 to 30 hours of retouching.

And it was those little lessons I learned I take with me. Like I don't want to spend 30 hours of retouching for something that I can do in in five seconds on set. You know, know what you don't know, right? Selftaught doesn't mean you know it all. And really don't be cheap where it hurts. Like you kids really do have it good. Like there used to be a ton of gatekeeping. Like everybody wants to share now. Lighting setups, dim sum spots, everything, right? Like you guys love to share and it's awesome. Like just really don't share surf spots. Like that's not cool. Um that said, there's really no replacement for your practical skills. Like if you have a chance to to be on set, assist whatever it is, do it. Just take it. Even if you don't get paid much, if you're parking trucks or getting coffee, just be on set. Um, when you're on set, don't be on your phone. Just be the one who's paying attention and you'll be the one to ask to help. And you learn just a lot. I selftaught. That's how I learned all my stuff was just being ready to jump in. um little things, how to use a seastand, how to put sandbags down, don't wear red, you know, little stuff that you don't think about that if you know what you're doing. People like, "Oh, this guy's this person's great. They'll call you back." Um, don't be don't be cheap or it hurts is like trust experts. Sometimes you have to spend money. Sometimes you have to hire an expert. Um, my accountant hiring my accountant was the best thing I ever did for my business. Really was. gives me good advice with more money than everything else. I but it's the best decision I ever made for my business because otherwise I would be broke right now. I have violated some financial laws or whatever and I nobody needs that goes back to photography is a business if you're doing it for a living and cash flow is king, you know. Um, this is one thing that I really was a hard lesson on the agency end. You know, it's like a lot of clients now. Pay it at 90 and you have to pay everybody at 30 or less. And it's daunting. You know, really make sure you add production fees up front. And if someone asks you to take it off, you can take it off, but you can never add it and add a pad. You know, budgeting, planning, how much is your shoot going to cost you, your scheduling, your overhead, everything. It's all math. You know, we're not doing this. It's not pro bono photography. You know, think about how much your financing costs you. Like if you have to put everything on a credit card, make sure you have enough money in the job to pay the interest. Um business end of it, like what's the ROI for your client, right? What what are your creative needs and their financial needs? Like you can't let yourself get mired in making everything perfect, especially now that we're being called content creators. you know the volume of content doesn't allow for um perfection and it and it helps when when you can manage those expectations up front you know you say you know this is what we have to work with and I think people would rather hear that than be disappointed you know it's easier to um surprise them and make them happy than it is to disappoint them comes back into here trust is implied it really is like if If anybody ever says you can trust me, like don't trust them. Um, it's broken. Trust is one of the hardest things to to do, you know? It's it's commitment is everything. Uh, if you you commit to it and do what you say you're going to do just and being reliable is what makes is what builds trust and it makes clients come back to you because they know you'll do it and they know you're going to succeed and that's ultimately all anybody wants. Nobody wants a problem, right? Nobody wants to to fix things. Um, you know, fake it till you make it, right? It really works. Like, I've committed to a bunch of stuff now that I don't know how to do and I'm in the midst of trying to build an AIdriven B2B digital salesunnel because I told someone, "Sure, I can figure that out. I mean, I'm not scared of it." And, uh, let's see. say uh hindsight is 2020. It really is.

Um my whole life, right, if um if you had to say something, you know, what what's the best piece of advice I can give to anybody, it would probably be um that uh you know, don't be afraid to make a wrong decision really like um any decision you're moving forward. Um, momentum is one of the hardest things to accomplish in life and to start again from a stop is almost impossible. It's way easier to change directions as long as you have momentum and um, mistakes happen, right? Growth is what happens when you when you show someone and yourself how you deal with with mistakes, problems, anything happens like like happens. It really does. And um you know it's it's uh sharing that with people like you know having mentorship like whatever you can do just to keep moving forward. Um that's kind of my whole life what's what's driven me like I you know I've never I never finished college. I never um had any real training other than just going for it, getting my hands dirty, pulling up my sleeves, and never saying die. And uh I think had I been stuck and had paralysis of choice, I might not be here. Like I really might not. I might not be doing the same things and I might not be so happy. So, you know, it's it's I think that the bad times help help drive the good. And let's hear uh this is it. Smoke them if you got them, right? Uh experiment, fail, commit, just keep going on. Just, you know, that's what we do. Just keep on going. Keep on going. Learn the craft and the business, right? like um it's both, you know, with with and uh hopefully you can marry them to a place that that is successful for you.

Collaboration really trust your team. Once you get a good team, anything you can do to keep it together like a lot of my uh my collaborators are my best friends and I'm really happy to work with them and uh they make everything better. They make my life easier. I hope I make their life easier. Um, it makes the work better when you you you have people that you respect and work and like to work with. Um, you know, know what you don't know and don't be afraid to learn. I really like um, you know, having a guy for that. That's what I like to joke about and say, I like to be that guy. If somebody calls me like, "Oh, yeah, sure." You know, no problem. I'll try to figure it out. And I feel like it's it's that attitude which um which propels me forward. Like even if I don't know what I'm doing, I'm sure as hell gonna g going to try to figure it out. And again, like do what you say you're going to do. it really um even if it costs you a little bit um in time or money or whatever it is, it's you can't put a dollar amount on um on uh trustworthiness or just on being dependable. Like that is something that my whole life I've been dependable and it's come back to me, you know, in in in spades. It's really been something that's helped keep my career and keep me employed and, you know, just keep me happy, right? Like I I I sleep well at night knowing that I'm not um lying to anybody about anything. Let's see. So, I think this is about all I have here of my presentation. So, really, thank you for your time and just enjoy the ride like every day. It's it's it's uh everyday is a gift. We like I like being here. So, um let's see. What do I do here now?

Am I That was great. You can stop sharing your screen and we'll have a a little conversation. Hello everyone. Um those of you who don't know me, I'm David Major. I chair the photography department here at the New York Film Academy. Uh and again, Michael, thank you so much for being here and walking us through uh your career essentially. Uh and before we get going really with the conversation, I want to encourage our viewers, if you have questions, please utilize the Q&A function at it'll be on the bottom of your Zoom screen and send in those questions. There was a lot that Mike talked about. Um I have a whole bunch of questions myself, so you know, supplement that by putting in your stuff. So like the first question I have for you is where are your secret surf spots? >> Not telling. >> Yeah. Okay. No, that was great. I mean I I I love that whole idea of sort of being open and sharing everything. You know, it's it's how we learn and even those of us that are doing the sharing, I think, learn by it also because we get feedback that way, too. Um, >> and I, you know, what I loved hearing from you is just how diverse your background really is. You know, like the number of different things you've done and decided like, yeah, I can do that. I'm going to tackle that. I'm going to figure that out. You know, I think that's so encouraging for our students especially to hear because often times, you know, they're like, okay, this is the only thing I want to do. I just want to take this one path. And then real life hits, right? and you sort of have to figure out ways around or doing that and and you know it's good to hear from somebody who's gone through that kind of process of you know okay this is working for now I'm here for 17 years now I got to do something different okay fantastic like and just being open to that is is really really cool >> as you know as as long as it doesn't um >> if if you can live with it it's you know it's it's that's a thing you know and it's it's um a lot of people are like oh this is selling out this is no it's not It's fine. It's like, you know, we we can as long as you can live with yourself, it's fine, you know, and and it's like um you know, part of learning like touch on something you just said, you know, with like the sharing is like like we're older, right? Like we we're used to gatekeeping. We're used to having to the old the old school term of paying your dues. Like that was terrible, you It was like really it was terrible, but it also worked because you didn't expect to show up and know everything and you there was a pecking order. It was definitely a lot ruddder. People were a lot meaner about it, but there was a sense of, you know, creative director, art director, uh, senior designer, junior designer, intern. There was this this really, you know, people weren't going to school to be art directors. They weren't going to school to be creative directors. uh if you're a photographer, you're expected to start as a PA, maybe if you're lucky, you'd be a second assistant, a first assistant, a gaffer. Like there was this sense of working way up a ladder. And I feel like the um even now, like 30 years into into doing this professionally, um I still assist. I I love it. I just like being on set. And sometimes I see something I'm like, "Ah, like that makes a lot of sense." and you see stuff and it's like again like if people are on their phone like I have like I have a you know my daughter's friends boyfriends and stuff will assist sometimes and you know they're high school kids from art and design and they'll come in and I'm like listen you know put your phone down bring a notebook write everything down write down people's names write down the clients coffee orders every single thing just write it down and you remember it and don't be on your phone I yelled at this kid a couple times get off your phone put his phone down and he realizes He's like, "You're right." He's like, "I really remember every single thing." And you know, you show somebody like like, "Oh, I know how to use a seand." I'm like, "No, you don't know how to use a seaand. Please, like, this is how I use a knuckle. This is how you use this. Like, just trust me, you don't know what you're doing." And like finally, you get these kids like, "Oh, yeah. I I watch a YouTube video on this. Doesn't matter." Like you, it's dangerous what you're doing. And like having that sense of of um knowing what you don't know, it's like a really smart, you know, it's something that a lot of people don't know. And it's like that's the first thing to know. Know what you don't know. And um and and again like I I still love being on set. I love shooting. I helped somebody out the other day and I was just like like oh you want to drive a box truck? I'm like sure no problem. Like I it was so nice to be on set and not be responsible for anything except driving a box truck. It was great. >> For sure. You know what's nice about what you just said too, I think, is is >> it really speaks to the idea of lifelong learning where, >> you know, admitting that, okay, I do have a lot of knowledge, but I can always learn more, >> right? No matter what it is you're doing, you think you're an expert in Photoshop, somebody else is doing something just a little differently that you can always learn from. And the same thing with the onset, right? There's there's, you know, there's not just one way to use a >> seastand. >> I do it one way, you do it another way, somebody else does it a third way. And the more open you are to recognizing that and learning that it just fills your toolbox, you know, in a way that won't happen if you're very just sort of stay in your lane. So that's pretty cool. >> Yeah. I mean, the the toolbox is the biggest thing about it and that's what makes you more valuable as somebody looking for work, you know? It's like because right now I can shoot anything from something this big to a house, you know, and whatever it is, I can light it because of my toolbox is is is pretty vast. Like and and just looking at stuff and I I try to light stuff really simply, one or two lights, like make sure your light motivates from what should be a real source, stuff that like is, you know, foundational. Whereas like I work with some people where more lights and everything and I'm just like what do you like? Come on, less is more. Come on. And like you, you know, it ends up being I've worked with enough people like like, "Oh, wow. This makes this is one light." I'm like, "Yeah, it's one light and two cards and it looks great." And it's like that thing where even these are friends of mine who've been working with for 20 years plus and like this is pretty good. Like I like this. And we we share a lot, you know, share a lot of that. >> So let's let's talk about that. So change direction just for a little bit.

um you know you talked about at one point when after that sort of long stint um on the agency side you were starting up again and started reaching out to I guess your past networks and that was sort of helping what I took from that is that that definitely helped your career transition because you had those folks. Can you talk a little bit especially to our students about the power of that network and and that also applies I think to the crew that you work with. you mentioned, you know, finding a good crew. Well, that's got to be part of your creative process, too, where you can then bounce these ideas off of them. So, just spend a little couple minutes just uh walking us down that idea. >> Um, that that kind of goes back to what I said just about doing what you say you're going to do, right? Be reliable. where >> if I had been unreliable at any one of these places I've been I wouldn't have maybe they wouldn't have taken my call or they wouldn't have trusted me with a big job that I needed when I was striking out kind of on my you know had to pay all my own bills for lack of a better words right so I think that that's a biggest one of the biggest parts about you know building a network is being reliable be somebody that people know they can count on be somebody that you know is, you know, you think about little and like one of the the agency I was at.

Um, what I one of the biggest things I learned and took from that was um, think about your client, right? You know, they're not, you know, we we were a Coca-Cola agency and we weren't allowed to have Pepsi products in the office of Fredo LA. And people would be offended. They'd be like, "Oh my god, this is, you know, I can't believe this." And the owner was like, "No, this is the hand that feeds us. You don't bite it." and and he respected the clients. He didn't treat them like a paycheck. He treated them like somebody that was worthy of a respect. And it really it drove that home to me because it made it made me realize like anybody you come in contact with in your career, they could be some creative director or some CMO or they could be working on some startup. You never know who's going to end up somewhere else. So, you just treat everybody like you want to be treated. And eventually, you know, it works or it doesn't. like it, you know, it's it's it's not not being mercenary about it, not being somebody who's always just looking for what they can get out of somebody, but treating somebody like some that somebody you want to be around. And it was, you know, I used to always bring pastries to shoots. I would be the DJ and stuff that like the little things that um, you know, think about the coffee, think like you think about just little stuff that makes everybody's life a little bit nicer and and it it pays itself back, you know. It really does. And like it uh it's it just it's it's more it's a more pleasant way to spend your day, you know? >> Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's, you know, check your attitude at the door and come in and >> work hard and >> be kind to everybody. Like, I think it's a great way to >> to sort of go through life, you know, it's it's really good.

>> Um, so so let's talk about your crew or the folks that you typically work with. you know, you mentioned that you've been working with the same folks for a long time. Um, for those emerging photographers, you know, like how how do you find that? How do you build that kind of rapport? >> I I think it's it's um even now like I I do a lot of tests all the time. I'll do stuff where like if there's younger stylists or younger art directors, whoever, I'm just like, "Yeah, come shoot whatever." Like, you know, because it helps me too. You know, it's like I'm, you know, sometimes you don't have time to figure it out on set. you want to make sure you know what you're doing. So, and then it gives you another way, you know, so you meet meet some people along the way, meet people.

Um, and again, it goes back to like being somebody that people want to be around, right? If if you are kind of a if you're kind of a jerk, people aren't going to want to be around you. So, if you're working with people, you you you work on relationships and you say, "Okay, yeah, let's do this. Let's do that." you end up going and having drinks, you do this and you like if they're working on a project, they'll bring you in and you end up just, you know, again, it's assisting or whatever it is. And if if you meet a great stylist to be like, "Oh, yeah. I'd love to assist you. I'll I'll work for whatever cheap, you know, you need me to carry your It's like back in the day, you would, you know, carry carry the DJ's records to get into the club for free." It's kind of that same that that same uh that same thing, you know. It's like the you know, sure, I'll I'll carry your gear to hang out on set and you know, assistant rates used to be like what is it? You know, you were you were stoked to get 200 bucks a day. That was a good day. And uh assistants now are like it's like 400 bucks a day or 450.

So, um, if you offer to work cheaper, you can build this crew of people so that when you do get a paying job, you can start shopping your work around and show people and say, "Here, this is what we can do." But just make sure you you know how to price it. I mean, that's really that's that's the hard part now with the industry is that there's so many people doing it that they're just giving unrealistic prices. You know, if somebody's at home, they don't have any expenses and they can do a job cheaper. they get the work, but then that's the price point and it it drives the pricing down and the whole industry like especially with AI it's hard you know you can't tell somebody who's younger like oh this is great work starting out but it's too cheap you know and then that's what happens is that you know you have people who have expectations they see somebody's work on Instagram it looks great but they don't know what's behind it and that person can't run a job they can't um deal with clients deal with sets deal with permits all the stuff that goes into producing a job and then they fall in their face. So, it's that whole pipeline of assisting and working your way through. It's the stuff the intangibles that are hard to learn, you know, and it Yeah, totally agree. I totally agree with that. And actually, that brings up a question that I was going to ask you. You know, you mentioned a bunch about um sort of the e-commerce world and how uh you know, rates are definitely different than they they were even I'm sure like five years ago, right? Um I think probably pre- pandemic you know things were very different than they are today but so again for think about this for emerging photographers and this is really for our students. Um how where do they get that information to base their estimates? You know like what kind of resources can they rely on?

Who can they go to to sort of talk about what's happening in the industry right now? I mean that's tough just like it's um you know producers, agents, you know there's a bunch of um there's a you know there's like if if somebody's young they call a lot of these agents. A lot of the agents are really they they like to see you know um they like to see people succeed because if people succeed they succeed. So, >> um, agents are always a good one to reach out. And I don't know if, um, you know, the little book show, it's still somehow still going, but you can go to the book and go to the show and talk to agents and talk to people and and it's just about going to try to go to industry stuff and and, um, you know, even on Instagram, there's that there's some, you'll probably know what it is, but, like, what is it called? A photo editor or something like that. They have um estimates and invoices and stuff. So, it's it's it's all out there, but again, it's it's hard to be able to present yourself as a professional unless you know how to really run a job because then clients have an expectation. If they're spending X,000 a day, they expect that professionalism.

>> Yeah. Oh, absolutely. No, I I'm a huge fan of encouraging students to start by assisting. >> You know, you got to learn the industry. So in school you learn h you know how to make images but then you got to learn how to produce images and there's they're two totally different things. So I think >> that's something the hard part of it and like you know pre and it's like a you know the content creator is is a I hate that term because it's kind of commodified what we do the art into just you know creation. So now it's um it's devalued it. You know, not saying it's without worth, but it's definitely the the days of somebody spending $100,000 for a day for you to shoot to have an image that's going to run a 360 campaign. It's going to be on bus shelters, you know, and the train and magazine covers and billboards. That's gone, right? Like, you know, it's now the social media is is the primary and the campaign work is almost secondary. So it's a really >> it used to it's you know Gucci would shoot three times a year right and that was the way it was and then now they expect content every every day every week it can't be the same and it's just a churn so it's impossible I uh when we were at the e-commerce studio it was funny because I I had uh you know some people working there and we're talking and they somebody's like oh this is really cynical and I'm like listen like you know the way I put it was uh I was like we're digital ditch diggers right somebody's going to hand you a shovel every day you're going to come in and you got to dig that hole out like you know spend your whole day dig dig dig dig dig and you're going to be like sweet that hole is empty and you're going to come in next day and the hole is going to be full again and every single day and they were like oh so you're saying our work is worthless I'm like no it's not worthless like you have to have the mindset of like I'm going to do the best work possible within the constraints every day and just keep going because the work's never going to end and it's fun work to do like it's not a bad thing like and you get to It's my my first job was in uh in weekly publishing. So every week we were making magazines. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And we could make mistakes. You learned stuff. That's how I learned how to retouch. That's how I learned how to design. I learned everything because we had such a high churn rate that it didn't matter. There was it wasn't it wasn't precious. So to treat e-commerce photography like it's precious, you're doing yourself a disservice. Like it should still be good. You should put your best effort towards it. But to treat it like it's a work of art, no, it's like you're taking pictures of plastic stuff to sell on Amazon. Like it is what it is. And like you can learn all it it's it's almost very freeing because you can make mistakes and be like you see something you're like, "Ah, it wasn't so good." And then the email campaign goes out and it's gone and no one ever thinks about it again. So it it kind of the impermanence is is is kind of fun. >> Yeah, I I could totally see that. But I also think, you know, it sort of goes back to something you said early on in your presentation about I think it might have actually been your first slide. You know, you're just happy to wake up every day, right? And so, you know, in an e-commerce situation, okay, you're not making art, but you're getting paid to make photographs, right? You're getting paid to make images. Like, and that's that's not a bad thing at all, you know? Like, it's >> it's pretty great. And it and it's it's it's artistic. It's it's art adjacent, right? You get to work with stylists or artists, right? You know, photographers, we're artists, but if I'm making e-commerce, it's not making art. And it's kind I'm okay with that. I'm totally okay with that. You know, it's like uh for my personal art right now, I haven't touched a camera for myself probably since my kids were small, since I stopped shooting film, when it got too expensive. And uh I cook. That's my art now. And like I feel like it's something that the rest of my life I'm going to get better and better and better at. It's something I want to share with people. And each technique, like every little knife thing I learn, everything every single I learn a new sauce or learn something new. I'm like reinvigorated every day to be like, "Oh, I want to make this better." I'm like, "Oh, this is the best thing I ever tasted. Oh my god." Where >> I still have that love in my heart for photography, but I'm not compelled to do it because, you know, like I I like to joke that like, you know, plumbers don't go home and play with wrenches, right? So, it's it's like if I'm not paid for it, I really kind of it's hard for me to want to pick up my camera even though I love it. I really and like I still I I wish film was cheaper to shoot, I would shoot film, you know? It's like when when Costco stopped processing when Costco stopped $6 machine prints, that's when I stopped shooting film. So, >> all right. So, one other question for you. Let's talk about I want to hear more about liquid stylists.

>> Tell me what that looks like. >> It's really cool. Well, the guys like we talk about our bag of tricks. This guy's got a huge bag of tricks. You know, he has like like rigs for everything and like, you know, little motion pio electric triggers and, you know, the um the way we got that splash around the bottle, he had little little laser cut plexi plexi stuff hit so when it hits it, it fans a certain way. And it was um >> it's a really specific specific skill set. It really is. And it's like uh you know he's he works with some some great great photographers and the stuff you see him do I'm just like wow. I'm like and it's fun working with people like that on set because you get to see that and be like oh that makesh I get it like and it now when I shoot liquid stuff I kind of know >> nowhere near as good as him. I kind of have it in my brain how to make liquid move a certain way or how to make like, you know, you take some plexiglass and you just heat gun and you bend it and make little little scoops and funnels and so that when it pours it has, you know, it's it's all it's it's fun. It's really fun to stop because it's got motion, you know, it has like even still photograph it looks like motion. Like that's what I like to do with shadows. I like to have stuff moving your eye across an image and >> that's so cool. really fun. There there used to be uh and they still sell some of the stuff at the set shop um studio called Trendrove Studios. Y know those guys? >> Yeah. So they used to make acrylic pores and do exactly what you was talking about creating the shapes so that you would get a certain arc or curve to those. It was super fun. Really cool stuff. Yeah, that was a I got to work with some really good >> uh when I was at my agency and we had, you know, we had Annheiser Bush Budgets. So, we got to work with some just great photographers and seeing stuff and I was like this guy Mark Lea really good uh liquid guy and some of his stuff I was like wow like this is how you do it. Like this is like being on set just seeing oh that makes a lot of sense to me. using beer pores and just beautiful, you know, and this is shooting on, you know, shooting all film and shooting chrome and it was just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful stuff. And you you it wasn't like now where you could be like, you know, bang out, you know, you're banging, I don't know, 1500 frames a day now. We were like a big day then you were shooting like I don't know 20 rolls or 30 rolls was a big day. So, >> Right. Right. That's true. Um, and I guess to sort of close it up, you know, at the end you said something that I think is really really important for both emerging photographers but but everybody, you know, which was don't be afraid to make a wrong decision. >> And that's such a great I I mean I think that's a great mantra in in of itself, you know, just be willing to take those risks. Um, and don't be afraid to fail because that's that's part of the learning curve, right? It's part of the process of like you've been saying, you know, okay, I just I'm just gonna figure it out, you know, like and it's all good. >> Yeah, it it really is. It really is like the um you know, like I I think I think failure is when you stop moving or stop trying like you know what I mean? Like when when you if total failure is when you're just like defeated like defeat is failure. So, as long as you can keep getting up and moving forward and moving towards the, you know, moving towards the goal, you're still winning, you know, and it's like, you know, it's it's like as the guy said something, you know, it's like like everything's 50/50, right? It's going to work or it won't. And even if it kind of works, it's still working. Like it's it's you can take that kind of works and move it towards it totally works. If you take that kind of works and just be like, I'm done with this and you give up, it still kind of works, but you're not happy with it and there's no movement. there's no progression and there's no there's no getting to where you want to be, you know, and it's like sometimes stuff just doesn't work. Like that's it's okay. And can be like, you know, it's it's the what's the old saying, right? You know, throwing good money after bed, right? Or bad. Yeah. Like you can't just stopping like sometimes I we'll do something on set and we'll spend an hour trying to make it perfect and trying to light it and try you know like if 20 stands up and like plexiglass and reflectors and everything all over the place and then it's just not working. And I've worked with some people who are like, "No, no, we're going to get it. We're going to get it." And I'm like, "No, stop. We're going to stop. We're going to take everything off the set, reset our brains, and do it again." And it it makes it like that's not failure. That's just knowing when to be like this isn't working. So, and and stuff like that is a really that's just born of of of volume of being like I got 40 shots to do today. I have six minutes a shot. This is it.

We're over. We're we're now working into our we we don't have money for another day. We don't have money for overtime. All this stuff. So, it's just keeping it in your head and knowing knowing when to like just shift gears and turn.

>> Yeah, absolutely. All right, great. So, we are at the top of the hour. Um, Mike, I want to thank you so much for this great conversation. Really enjoyed chatting with you about this and love seeing the work. Um, >> it was great, Mike. Thank you so much.

>> Yeah, that's the Nancy voice of God coming in. It's perfect. Thank you, Nancy. >> Thank you, Nancy. Yeah. And I hope honestly, Mike, I hope this is the beginning of conversations for us. I think, you know, you got a lot to offer and I really love the way you think about things and sound, you know, hearing how you move through the world. So hopefully we'll do this again. >> Yeah. Hopefully. Thank you. Thank you. >> All right. Thanks everyone for being here and we will see you soon.
