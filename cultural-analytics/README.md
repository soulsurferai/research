# Cultural Analytics (WorldviewV2 work files)

This folder is a direct copy of your `WorldviewV2` working directory (minus the zip), published for provenance.

## Contents

- `analysis_results/` — JSON outputs, prompts, and generated charts
- `*.py` — analysis scripts (Qdrant + embedding-based emotion analysis)
- `subreddit_selection.json` — configuration / selections
- `requirements.txt` — python deps for this folder

## Notes

- This is a lift-and-shift snapshot of an evolving research folder; it is intentionally not polished.
- Credentials are not stored here. Scripts load configuration from environment variables / external `.env` files.
- The `scripts_and_readme.zip` file was intentionally excluded.
