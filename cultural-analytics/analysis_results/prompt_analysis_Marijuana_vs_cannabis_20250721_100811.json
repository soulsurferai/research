## Task: Interpret the semantic differences between r/Marijuana and r/cannabis

I've analyzed the semantic embeddings and language patterns of two subreddits using vector similarity and NLP techniques. Below are the key findings. Please provide a thoughtful interpretation of what these results reveal about the worldviews, values, and communication patterns of these communities.

## Questions for interpretation:
1. What are the defining characteristics of each community's worldview?
2. How do these communities differ in their emotional and cognitive approaches?
3. What potential bridges exist for communication between these communities?
4. What underlying values or assumptions might explain these semantic differences?
